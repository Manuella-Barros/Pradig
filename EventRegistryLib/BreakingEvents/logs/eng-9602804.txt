He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nWith the statement, Bruni carefully avoided an outright confirmation that the pope had indeed used the term, in keeping with the Vatican's tradition of not revealing what the pope says behind closed doors. But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis had used the term and acknowledged that some people had been offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a subsequent document in 2016, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men had left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in Eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with the Associated Press, \"Being homosexual is not a crime. \"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors":

CNN's Christopher Lamb reports.\n\nVATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis apologized Tuesday after he was quoted using a vulgar and derogatory term about gay men to reaffirm the Catholic Church's ban on gay priests.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni issued a statement acknowledging the media storm that erupted about Francis' comments, which were delivered behind closed doors to Italian bishops on May 20.\n\nItalian media on Monday quoted unnamed Italian bishops in reporting that Francis jokingly used the term \"faggotness\" while speaking in Italian during the encounter. He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nWith the statement, Bruni carefully avoided an outright confirmation that the pope had indeed used the term, in keeping with the Vatican's tradition of not revealing what the pope says behind closed doors. But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nTags Wire Dcc Lee-national\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

in a private meeting last week when he was asked whether gay men should be allowed to train for the priesthood provided they remained celibate.\n\nItalian political gossip website Dagospia was the first to report the alleged incident, said to have happened on May 20 when the pontiff met Italian bishops behind closed doors.\n\n\"The Pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he apologises to those who felt offended by the use of a term reported by others,\" Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian Bishops' Conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians.\n\nThe document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a subsequent document in 2016, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed that position in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of f****tness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from Dagospia.\n\nBruni reiterated that the pope remained committed to a welcoming Catholic Church for all, where \"nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, [where] there is room for everyone.\"\n\nItalian is not Francis's native language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows.\n\nThe 87-year-old has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge?\" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past.", "source": {"uri":

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nWith the statement, Bruni carefully avoided an outright confirmation that the pope had indeed used the term, in keeping with the Vatican's tradition of not revealing what the pope says behind closed doors. But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis had used the term and acknowledged that some people had been offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a subsequent document in 2016, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men had left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \" Being homosexual is not a crime. \"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"", "source": {"uri": "weareiowa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local 5 -

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nWith the statement, Bruni carefully avoided an outright confirmation that the pope had indeed used the term, in keeping with the Vatican's tradition of not revealing what the pope says behind closed doors. But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis had said it.\n\nAnd for those who have long advocated for greater inclusion and acceptance of LGBTQ Catholics, the issue was bigger than the word itself.\n\n\"More than the offensive slur uttered by the pope, what is damaging is the institutional church's insistence on 'banning' gay men from the priesthood as if we all do not know (and minister alongside) many, many gifted, celibate, gay priests,\" noted Natalia Imperatori-Lee, chair of the religious studies department at Manhattan College.\n\n\"The LGBTQ community seems to be a constant target of offhand, off the cuff 'mistakes' from people in the Vatican, including the pope, who should know better,\" she added.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a subsequent document in 2016, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men had left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may. Church teaching holds that gay people must be treated with dignity and respect but that homosexual activity is \"intrinsically disordered.\"\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \" Being homosexual is not a crime. \"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nAndrea Rubera, a spokesperson for Paths of Hope, an Italian association of LGBTQ Christians, said he was incredulous when he first read about the pope's comments, and then sad when no denial came from the Vatican. It showed, he said, that the pope and the Vatican still have a \"limited view\" of the reality of LGBTQ people.\n\n\"We hope, once again, that the time will come to undertake a discussion in the church toward a deepening of the LGBT issue, especially from the experience of the people themselves,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan

In 2013, at the start of his papacy, he famously stated, \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\" Last year, he allowed priests to bless members of same-sex couples, triggering significant conservative backlash.\n\nNevertheless, he delivered a similar message on gay seminarians - minus the reported swear word - when he met Italian bishops in 2018, telling them to carefully vet priesthood applicants and reject any suspected homosexuals.\n\nIn a 2005 document, released under Francis's late predecessor Benedict XVI, the Vatican said the Church could admit into the priesthood those who had clearly overcome homosexual tendencies for at least three years.\n\nThe document said practicing homosexuals and those with \"deep-seated\" gay tendencies and those who \"support the so-called gay culture\" should be barred.\n\n(With agency inputs)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said. Francis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians.\n\nThe document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests. The Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a subsequent document in 2016, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed that position in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia. Italian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows.\n\nThe 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private. He has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge\" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@indianexpress.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ordination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_for_Catholic_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congregation for Catholic Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linguistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Sports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Pope.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 492, "textEnd": 498, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

He then said that seminaries, or priesthood colleges, are already too full of \"frociaggine,\" which translates roughly to \"faggotness.\"\n\nCorriere cited some unnamed bishops in its report, who suggested the pope, an Argentine, may not have realized the Italian word he used was offensive since it isn't his mother tongue.\n\nThe Vatican has been contacted for comment via email.\n\nThe reported comments sparked a backlash on social media.\n\n\"So you know how Pope Francis is generally portrayed as a big cuddly liberal?\" Marcus Walker, a clergyman in the Church of England, wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"He has just used perhaps the most offensive homophobic term in Italian (basically f*g**t) while calling on bishops not to accept any seminarians who are gay.\"\n\nAnother person wrote on X: \"This is the 'progressive' pope? Yikes. So if gay men can't marry & can't become priests, what vocation are we called to? A life of lonely celibacy & asceticism as a layperson? So long as we're considered 'intrinsically disordered' there's no room at the inn for queer Catholics.\"\n\nAnother called on the Vatican \"to clarify this immediately.\"\n\nAnother person wrote: \"That's disappointing. So long as the men can live celibate lives and demonstrate psycho-sexual maturity as any other candidate must, I don't see why they should be rejected. One need not reject gay men to reject the establishment of a 'gay culture' within the priesthood.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"Pope Francis using the word 'faggot' in 2024 is straight out of a South Park episode.\"\n\nAnother person wrote: \"Has the pope lost his mind? Dementia? Big swing in beliefs.\"\n\nHowever, others welcomed Francis' alleged comments.\n\n\"I would like to thank Pope Francis for saying out loud what most normal Catholics think but are not allowed to say,\" wrote Eric Sammons, the editor-in-chief of Crisis magazine.\n\nAnother wrote: \"Pope Francis is right, despite his language. I feel. He will bless individuals but why should he ordain against the core teachings because of LGBT getting upset as usual.\"\n\nFrancis, 87, has made making the Catholic Church more welcoming to the LGBTQ+ community a hallmark of his papacy.\n\n\"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\" he notably told reporters at the start of his papacy in 2013. He made those comments in Italian, but using the English word \"gay.\"\n\nLast year, he told The Associated Press that homosexuality is a sin, but not a crime. And he also formally approved letting Catholic priests bless same-sex couples, sparking a backlash from conservatives.\n\nBut Francis has been clear about not permitting gay people to join the clergy.\n\nIn 2018, he said that applicants to seminaries should be carefully vetted.\n\n\"The issue of homosexuality is a very serious issue that must be adequately discerned from the beginning with the candidates,\" he said. \"In our societies it even seems that homosexuality is fashionable and that mentality, in some way, also influences the life of the church.\"", "source": {"uri":

The group was discussing the issue of admitting homosexual men into seminaries when Francis used an Italian term that represents a vulgar way to refer to a gay person, the sources said.\n\nFrancis reiterated that gay men should not be allowed to train in seminaries as priests, according to Italian media, which said that his use of the slur left some in the audience surprised given the pope's track record of a more welcoming approach toward the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nThe Vatican responded to the reports on Tuesday, saying that the pope was \"aware of articles that recently came out about a conversation, behind closed doors, with the bishops.\"\n\n\"As he has had the opportunity to state on several occasions, 'In the Church there is room for everyone, for everyone! No one is useless, no one is superfluous, there is room for everyone. Just as we are, everyone,'\" Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term, reported by others,\" Bruni added.\n\nThe political gossip website Dagospia appears to have been the first to report on the alleged incident, citing multiple \"shocked\" bishops who took part in the bishop conference.\n\nOne of Italy's largest newspapers, Corriere della Sera, quoted several unnamed bishops suggesting that the pope may not have been aware of how offensive the word is in Italian.\n\nVatican veteran reporter and author Gerry O'Connell also suggested that the pope's remark was \"a gaffe on the part of the pope, rather than a slur,\" as a nonnative Italian speaker.\n\nThe alleged comment came as a surprise to many as Francis, 87, is known for having more liberal views than many of his predecessors when it comes to the LGBTQ+ community, as well as on other issues such as the role of women in the Catholic Church and the environment.\n\nLast December, he formally approved allowing priests to bless same-sex couples because people seeking God's love and mercy shouldn't be subject to \"an exhaustive moral analysis\" to receive it.\n\nIn August, he also said that the Catholic Church is open to everyone, including the gay community, and that it has a duty to accompany them on a personal path of spirituality but within the framework of its rules.\n\nFrancis set the tone at the beginning of his papacy in 2013 when he made an off-the-cuff remark to reporters that won over many critics who had dismissed the church as close-minded. \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge him?\" he said.\n\nAn instruction issued by the Vatican under Francis' predecessor, Pope Benedict, in 2005 ruled that those who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture\" cannot be admitted into the seminary or holy orders.", "source": {"uri": "today.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TODAY.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

CNN's Christopher Lamb reports.\n\nVATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis apologized Tuesday after he was quoted using a vulgar and derogatory term about gay men to reaffirm the Catholic Church's ban on gay priests.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni issued a statement acknowledging the media storm that erupted about Francis' comments, which were delivered behind closed doors to Italian bishops on May 20.\n\nItalian media on Monday quoted unnamed Italian bishops in reporting that Francis jokingly used the term \"faggotness\" while speaking in Italian during the encounter. He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nSt. Louis alt-weekly Riverfront Times sold, lays off all staff Sisters, 8 and 10, who died in wreck on I-270 were best friends, family says The end of Riverfront Times brings shock, sense of loss.

Paul Goldschmidt launches two homers as Cardinals reign over Cubs in sweep\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nWith the statement, Bruni carefully avoided an outright confirmation that the pope had indeed used the term, in keeping with the Vatican's tradition of not revealing what the pope says behind closed doors. But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

Pope Francis apologized Tuesday, May 28, 2024, after he was quoted using a vulgar term about gays to reaffirm the Catholic Church's ban on gay priests. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni issued a statement acknowledging the media storm that erupted about Francis' comments, which were delivered behind closed doors to Italian bishops on May 20. (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini, File)\n\nPope Francis apologized Tuesday after he was quoted using a vulgar and derogatory term about gay men to reaffirm the Catholic Church's ban on gay priests.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni issued a statement acknowledging the media storm that erupted about Francis' comments, which were delivered behind closed doors to Italian bishops on May 20.\n\nItalian media on Monday had quoted unnamed Italian bishops in reporting that Francis jokingly used the term \"faggotness\" while speaking in Italian during the encounter. He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nWith the statement, Bruni carefully avoided an outright confirmation that the pope had indeed used the term, in keeping with the Vatican's tradition of not revealing what the pope says behind closed doors. But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis had used the term and acknowledged that some people had been offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a subsequent document in 2016, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men had left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \" Being homosexual is not a crime. \"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [],

the remark in a closed-door meeting with bishops, according to the country's largest daily newspapers La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera.\n\nBoth quoted the Pope as using the vulgar Italian term \"frociaggine\" when describing priesthood colleges as already too full of homosexuality.\n\nThe Vatican has not commented on the reports.\n\nThe incident is said to have happened on 20 May, as first reported by political gossip website Dagospia, when the Italian Bishops Conference held a private meeting with the Pope.\n\nLa Repubblica based its story on several unspecified sources, while Corriere cited unnamed bishops, who suggested the Pope, an Argentinian, might have not realised the Italian term is offensive.\n\n\"It's all the fault of some bishop who broke his mandate of silence to report the gaffe that occurred last week,\" reported Il Messaggero, a national paper based in Rome.\n\nAccording to the paper, the Pope's comments came during an informal Q&A session at the annual bishops' meeting which was attended by over 200 members of the clergy.\n\nThe Pope, 87, has been credited with leading the Roman Catholic Church into taking a more welcoming approach towards the LGBT+ community.\n\nAt the start of his papacy in 2013, he said: \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\"\n\nLast year, he allowed priests to bless same-sex couples,

He then said that seminaries already have too much \"frociaggine,\" which loosely translates to \"faggotness.\"\n\nThe bishops said they were surprised about the Pope's use of the word, claiming simultaneously that it was a \"joke\" and that Francis did not know the meaning. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni issued a statement after backlash ensued, telling the Associated Press that Francis has emphasized LGBTQ+ outreach as Pope, and that he believes there is \"room for everyone\" in the church.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nFrancis has often been perceived as more accepting of LGBTQ+ Catholics than his predecessors. When asked by a journalist in 2013 about gay priests being included, he said, \"If someone is gay and seeks the Lord with good will, who am I to judge?\" He later upheld that the church should apologize to LGBTQ+ people for mistreating them.\n\nHowever, Francis has not changed church doctrine. He approved a Vatican document in 2016 reaffirming that \"persons with homosexual tendencies\" are barred from Roman Catholic seminaries and priesthood. He also recently allowed priests to bless same-sex couples, though only if the blessing does not resemble a wedding nor take place as part of regular church activities.", "source": {"uri": "advocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gay News, LGBT Rights, Politics, Entertainment"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corriere della Sera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Repubblica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Repubblica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Sports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Computers_and_Internet", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Computers and Internet", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.advocate.com/media-library/pope-francis-apologizes-for-using-homophobic-slur-during-debate-about-gay-priests.jpg?id=52334426&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C39%2C0%2C39", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

CNN's Christopher Lamb reports.\n\nVATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis apologized Tuesday after he was quoted using a vulgar and derogatory term about gay men to reaffirm the Catholic Church's ban on gay priests.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni issued a statement acknowledging the media storm that erupted about Francis' comments, which were delivered behind closed doors to Italian bishops on May 20.\n\nItalian media on Monday quoted unnamed Italian bishops in reporting that Francis jokingly used the term \"faggotness\" while speaking in Italian during the encounter. He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nWith the statement, Bruni carefully avoided an outright confirmation that the pope had indeed used the term, in keeping with the Vatican's tradition of not revealing what the pope says behind closed doors. But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

Over the decades, the community has made inroads into Israeli society, and most of them have citizenship or residency rights. But 130 members remain undocumented, and Israeli authorities have ordered them to leave. The orders have left dozens of people, some of whom have lived most of their lives in Israel, in an uncertain legal limbo.(AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo)\n\nMaya Alleruzzo\n\nA girl watches the sunset over the scenic Kadisha Valley, a holy landmark for Lebanon's Maronite Christians, in the northeast mountain town of Bcharre, Lebanon, Friday, July 21, 2023.

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others.\"\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nWith the statement, Bruni carefully avoided an outright confirmation that the pope had indeed used the term, in keeping with the Vatican's tradition of not revealing what the pope says behind closed doors. But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis had used the term and acknowledged that some people had been offended by it.\n\n\" READ MORE: Vatican blasts gender-affirming surgery, surrogacy, and gender theory as violations of human dignity\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a subsequent document in 2016, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men had left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\n\" READ MORE: Pope approves blessings for same-sex couples that must not resemble marriage\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge\" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \" Being homosexual is not a crime. \"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"},

No one is useless, no one is superfluous, there is room for everyone. Just as we are, everyone,'\" Bruni said.\n\nLa Repubblica had reported that the word the pope used in Italian \"made more than one bishop flinch. The man (Pope Francis) is no stranger to verbal intemperance; the meeting was behind closed doors, the conversation informal, but when Pope Francis used that word\" there was tension in the room.\n\nWhile Pope Francis insisted to the bishops that LGBTQ+ Catholics must be accepted in the church and treated with respect, he reportedly said at the meeting that it is better not to accept gay men as candidates for the priesthood. Bruni did not comment on that report.\n\nDuring a similar closed-door meeting with Italian bishops in 2018, La Repubblica reported, the pope told them if they had \"even the slightest doubt\" about a gay candidate being able to live a life of celibacy in the seminary and as a priest, \"it is better not to let them in.\"\n\nIn a book-length interview in 2018, Pope Francis had said superiors must be able to help gay candidates prepare for a life of celibacy or encourage them to leave the seminary.\n\n\"Homosexuality is a very serious matter, which must be discerned adequately from the beginning with candidates, if it is the case. We must be demanding,\" the pope had told Claretian Father Fernando Prado in the book-interview, \"The Strength of Vocation: Consecrated Life Today.\"\n\nPope Francis made it clear in the interview that he was talking about homosexual activity among priests and religious who make vows of chastity and celibacy.\n\n\"In consecrated life or that of the priesthood, there is no place for this type of affection,\" the pope said. \"For that reason, the church recommends that persons with this deep-seated tendency not be accepted for ministry or consecrated life.\"\n\nA 2005 instruction from the then-Congregation for Catholic Education, approved by Pope Benedict XVI, said the church \"cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called 'gay culture.'\"\n\nBishops and superiors of religious orders, who are responsible for the final decision about admitting candidates to the priesthood and religious life, have continued to discuss and debate the meaning of \"deep-seated homosexual tendencies,\" which apparently was what prompted the question to the pope during his meeting with the Italian bishops' conference.", "source": {"uri": "catholicregister.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Catholic Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cindy_wooden@catholicregister.org", "name": "Cindy

The group was discussing the issue of admitting homosexual men into seminaries when Francis used an Italian term that represents a vulgar way to refer to a gay person, the sources said.\n\nFrancis reiterated that gay men should not be allowed to train in seminaries as priests, according to Italian media, which said that his use of the slur left some in the audience surprised given the pope's track record of a more welcoming approach toward the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nPolitical gossip website Dagospia appears to have been the first to report on the alleged incident, citing multiple \"shocked\" bishops who took part in the bishop conference.\n\nThe Vatican has not officially commented on the pope's alleged remark, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.\n\nOne of Italy's largest newspapers, Corriere della Sera, quoted several unnamed bishops suggesting that the pope may not have been aware of how offensive the word is in Italian.\n\nVatican veteran reporter and author Gerry O'Connell also suggested that the pope's remark was \"a gaffe on the part of the pope, rather than a slur,\" as a non-native Italian speaker.\n\nThe alleged comment came as a surprise to many as Pope Francis, 87, is known for having more liberal views than many of his predecessors when it comes to the LGBTQ+ community, as well as on other issues such as the role of women in the Catholic Church and the environment.\n\nLast December, he formally approved allowing priests to bless same-sex couples because people seeking God's love and mercy shouldn't be subject to \"an exhaustive moral analysis\" to receive it.\n\nIn August, he also said that the Catholic Church is open to everyone, including the gay community, and that it has a duty to accompany them on a personal path of spirituality but within the framework of its rules.\n\nFrancis set the tone at the beginning of his papacy in 2013 when he made an off-the-cuff remark to reporters that won over many critics who had dismissed the church as close-minded. \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge him?\" he said.\n\nAn instruction issued by the Vatican under Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict, in 2005 ruled that those who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture\" cannot be admitted into the seminary or holy orders.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nWith the statement, Bruni carefully avoided an outright confirmation that the pope had indeed used the term, in keeping with the Vatican's tradition of not revealing what the pope says behind closed doors. But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis had used the term and acknowledged that some people had been offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a subsequent document in 2016, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men had left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \" Being homosexual is not a crime. \"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"", "source": {"uri": "oneidadispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneida Dispatch"},

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

extremely vulgar term about gay priests", "body": "The pontiff, 87, has been forced to apologise after allegedly using the slur\n\nPope Francis has been forced to apologise after he allegedly used an extremely vulgar term during a conversation about gay priests.\n\nThe 87-year-old pontiff is said to have made the offensive remark during a meeting with bishops on 20 May as they discussed the topic of admitting homosexual men into seminaries, which is where priests are trained.\n\nAccording to multiple Italian publications, he made the derogatory comment during a closed-door meeting in Rome last week as the conversation turned to gay men being admitted into Catholic seminaries.\n\nIt's something which the Italian bishops conference (CEI) is said to have been weighing up for some time, as the Vatican currently have a complete ban on gay priests.\n\nYet when Pope Francis was asked what he thinks, reports claim that he responded by doubling down on his stance that gay men should not be admitted, although he believes there is 'room for everyone' in the Catholic Church.\n\nHe is said to have suggested that those with this sexual identity could risk leading a double life, before slipping in a slur.\n\nFrancis is alleged to have then added that he thought there was already too much 'frociaggine' in some seminaries as it is - which is an Italian word which roughly translates to 'f****tness'.\n\nPublications including La Repubblica, Corriere and Adnkronos listed quotes from unnamed bishops who insisted that he had used the term as a 'joke', while saying that those who heard it were left stunned.\n\nOne source suggested that the Pope might not have realised that the term was offensive, as Italian is not his first language.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni has since issued a statement explaining that the pontiff did not intend to cause offence and that he 'never intended' to be homophobic.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nThe bishops were said to have been going over a recently approved document which outlines the new training methods for men attending seminarians in Italy before being ordained.\n\nIt has not been published yet and is waiting to be reviewed, but reports claim it attempted to bring in some change surrounding the absolute ban on gay priests.\n\nPope Francis has been a lot more inclusive to the LGBTQ+ community than his predecessors since he was elected in 2013, even previously famously saying in response to a query about gay priests: \"Who am I to judge?\"\n\nIn December, the pontiff green lit a ruling which allows priests to bless unmarried and same-sex couples, which was seen as a big move for the Catholic Church.", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LADbible"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

ANSA/ETTORE FERRARI\n\nPope Francis, known as a humanitarian, but also outspoken Pope, has attracted criticism again, this time for allegedly using a common slur word to refer to gay men and to tell Italian bishops to not permit them to train for the priesthood.\n\nCiting sources from inside the closed-door meeting that took place last week, the Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica newspapers reported Monday that the Pope had made the comments while meeting with Italian bishops on May 20. Given the closed nature of the meeting, there is no official transcript of the proceedings, or proof of the Pope's misstep.\n\nThe newspaper articles, which were translated from Italian, claimed the Pope had said there is \"frociaggine\" - which translates in English to \"faggotry\" - in some of the seminaries.\n\nThe remarks allegedly were made in the context of the admission guidelines to the seminaries and the bishops' proposals for their modifications.\n\nThe issue is not a new concern for the pontiff or the bishops. The Vatican ruled in 2005 that the church cannot allow the ordination of men who are actively gay or have \"deep-seated\" homosexual tendencies. In 2016, Francis upheld this ruling. Two years later he told the Italian bishops not to accept gay candidates for the priesthood.\n\nThe alleged remarks and slur, made behind closed doors, would suggest an ambivalence in the Pope's position on homosexuality. During his pontificate, the Pope has sought to offer a more welcoming approach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, saying \"who am I to judge?\" when asked about gay priests, and has also offered the possibility that priests could offer informal blessings for same-sex couples.\n\nThe Corriere della Sera newspaper has suggested that Pope Francis, whose first language is Spanish and whose familiarity with Italian is thorough but perhaps not nuanced, may not have been aware of how offensive his choice of words was, adding that the remark and use of \"frociaggine\" was greeted with incredulous embarrassed laughter by the bishops.\n\nA source close to the Pope told CNN that perhaps he meant that there is a \"gay climate\" in the seminaries. This would be a less charged way of expressing it but would still underline that he considers it a serious problem that needs to be managed.", "source": {"uri": "lavocedinewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Voce di New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priesthood_in_the_Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Priesthood in the Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore_Ferrari", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ettore Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corriere della Sera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter's_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Peter's Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Repubblica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Repubblica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ordination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pontiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenzia_Nazionale_Stampa_Associata", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Sports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://lavocedinewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/ansa/2024/03/06/79e91d45d2e0512b02326b6642f47633.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 594, "textEnd": 600}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The document, which hasn\u2019t been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican\u2019s absolute ban on gay priests.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a subsequent document in 2016, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \u201cpractice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\u201d\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed that position in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \u201cthere is already an air of faggotness\u201d in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis\u2019 mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \u201cWho am I to judge\u201d comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past.\n\nAdditional reporting by Agence France-Presse", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ordination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_for_Catholic_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congregation for Catholic Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linguistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Sports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 19}], "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/28/80b5f84e-8782-41a8-817f-83f9184297ba_547c62d3.jpg?itok=mu3x3hbc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 632, "textEnd": 638, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

He has now apologized for using gay slurs in a private meeting with Italian bishops.\n\nVatican City * During a closed-door meeting with 200 Italian bishops last week, Pope Francis allegedly used derogatory terms to describe gay people during debates about whether the Italian church should allow gay men to enter the seminary.\n\nAccording to local reports, the Argentine pope said \"there is already enough faggotry\" in Catholic seminaries, in his speech to prelates May 20. The pope used the Italian term \"frociaggine,\" a rarely used slur to describe flamboyant gay attitudes. Francis allegedly also used other disparaging words to describe gays.\n\n\"The pope never meant to offend or express himself with homophobic terms, and he issues his most sincere apologies to all those who felt offended by the use of a term reported by others,\" read a statement Tuesday by Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni.\n\nThe Vatican did not deny that the pope used those terms.\n\nThe statement clarified that the pope is aware of the news reports regarding his private meeting with the Italian bishops and that Francis wants to reiterate his belief that \"in the church, there is a place for everyone, for everyone! No one is useless, no one is superfluous, there is space for everyone. Just the way we are, everyone.\"\n\nThe Italian bishops, who were convened for the national assembly meeting in Rome, are considering relaxing the ban on admitting gay men to the seminary.\n\nIndividuals who are engaging in same-sex sexual encounters or have \"deeply rooted homosexual tendencies\" are not allowed to enter the seminary, according to a 2005 Vatican instruction. Inspired by the pope's opening toward LGBTQ faithful, Italian bishops are discussing the possibility of removing the ban on those who have gay tendencies.\n\nDuring the meeting, which lasted an hour and a half, the pope allegedly stated that the church should continue to bar entry to the priesthood to gay men. After his famous words \"who am I to judge?\" in answering a question on gay priests, Francis' new comments struck many faithful as contradictory.\n\n\"When Pope Francis' private conversations are made public, it's always difficult to understand the full meaning of what he is saying,\" Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, a Catholic ministry to LGBTQ faithful in the U.S., said Tuesday in a message to Religion News Service.\n\n\"His apology is a model for all Catholic leaders who continue to use language and ideas that offend LGBTQ+ people,\" he added. \"It is disappointing, however, that the pope did not clarify more specifically what he meant by banning gay men from the priesthood. Without a clarification, it would seem that his words intend a blanket ban on all gay men.\"\n\nDeBernardo questioned whether the pope was aware of how offensive his words were and whether Francis was referring to men who are in gay sexual relationships when addressing the priesthood.\n\n\"These possible explanations, however, do not excuse the pope's comments,\" he added. \"Pope Francis has not always been clear in his remarks about LGBTQ+ people. We hope this incident will encourage him to learn more about the language he uses and about how misuse can be dangerously harmful.\"\n\nThe pope has seemed to offer an unprecedented opening toward LGBTQ faithful, meeting with gay dignitaries and advocates at the Vatican, supporting the pastoral outreach to the LGBTQ community of Jesuit priest James Martin and helping transgender communities.\n\nBut the pope's words of welcoming to LGBTQ faithful have not led to any change to the church's teachings on homosexuality, including that gay acts are a sin. Last year, the Vatican's Department for the Doctrine of the Faith cautiously allowed priests to bless same-sex couples, but the pope took a step back on the historic decision by stating that gay unions cannot be blessed because they are contrary to natural law in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that aired May 20.\n\nIn the same interview, Francis said that gay people can be blessed as individuals and that \"everyone\" is welcome in the church.\n\nThe long speech to Italian bishops was delivered in Italian, which isn't the pope's native language, but this isn't the first time Francis has used colorful language to get his message across. While speaking to sex abuse victims in Dublin in 2018, the pope said that priests who covered up abuse are \"sh- -\" and he has accused media outlets of \"coprophilia,\" meaning that they are aroused by excrement.\n\nThe pope's comments come shortly before Rome's gay pride parade, which is set to take place June 15.", "source": {"uri": "sltrib.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Salt Lake

The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

minus the reported swear word - when he met Italian bishops in 2018, telling them to carefully vet priesthood applicants and reject any suspected homosexuals.\n\nIn a 2005 document, released under Francis's late predecessor Benedict XVI, the Vatican said the Church could admit into the priesthood those who had clearly overcome homosexual tendencies for at least three years.\n\nThe document said practicing homosexuals and those with \"deep-seated\" gay tendencies and those who \"support the so-called gay culture\" should be barred.", "source": {"uri": "odt.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Otago Daily Times Online News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Repubblica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "La Repubblica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corriere della Sera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pontiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope Benedict XVI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Computers_and_Internet", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Computers and Internet", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.odt.co.nz/sites/default/files/story/2024/05/2024-05-27t192311z_457823295_rc2jv7aerobt_rtrmadp_3_pope-lgbt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 662, "textEnd": 668}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bryan Parkway to be closed Tuesday-Friday next week\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nWith the statement, Bruni carefully avoided an outright confirmation that the pope had indeed used the term, in keeping with the Vatican's tradition of not revealing what the pope says behind closed doors. But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

Pictured: The opening session of the 79th general assembly of the Italian Bishops Conference\n\nPope Francis attends a Mass in St Peter's Square for the first World Children's Day on May 26\n\nItalian political gossip website Dagospia was the first to report the alleged incident, said to have happened on May 20 when the pontiff met Italian bishops behind closed doors.\n\nBruni said Francis was 'aware' of the reports.\n\nThe Vatican spokesman reiterated that the pope remained committed to a welcoming Church for all, where 'nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, (where) there is room for everyone.'\n\nBishops at the meeting last Monday were reportedly taken aback by the language the pontiff used to make the statement - the derogatory word 'frociaggine', which roughly translates to f*****ry.\n\nItalian news agency Adnkronos, citing sources, reported that the Pope said in the speech: 'Look: there is already an air of f*****ry around that is not good.\n\n'There is today's culture of homosexuality with respect to those who have a homosexual orientation [who] are better off not being accepted [into the seminary].\n\n'It is very difficult for a boy who has this tendency not to fall [into sin] because they come [to the seminary] thinking that the life of the priest can support them, but then they fall during the work of the ministry.'\n\nThe remark was met with 'incredulous laughter', bishops told newspaper Corriere della Sera, but to some represented a step back after prolonged efforts to reform the church's position on LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nFrancis, who is 87, has been credited with making substantial overtures towards the LGBT community during his 11-year papacy, but his reported comments caused shock and consternation, even among his supporters.\n\nIn 2013, at the start of his papacy, he famously said: 'If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?'\n\nAnd last year, he described laws that criminalise homosexuality as a 'sin' and an 'injustice', and allowed Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples in a significant advance for LGBT rights in the church.\n\nHowever, the Pope delivered a similar message on gay seminarians - minus the reported swear word - when he met Italian bishops in 2018, telling them to carefully vet priesthood applicants and reject anyone suspected of being homosexual.\n\nPolitical gossip website Dagospia was the first to report on the alleged incident, said to have happened on May 20, when the Italian Bishops Conference opened a four-day assembly with a non-public meeting with the pontiff.\n\nBorn in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Francis's native language is Spanish, and though he is fluent in Italian he has made a number of linguistic faux pas in the past.\n\nHe has previously said that if a boy is unsure about his sexuality and is facing mental health challenges he might need 'psychiatric' support.\n\nIt widely believed he instead meant 'psychological' help, words he has also confused on other occasions.\n\nFrancesco Lepore, a former priest who is now a gay rights activist, said he was 'stunned' by the comments allegedly made by Francis, who is also known by his birth name Jorge Mario Bergoglio.\n\n'Despite being accustomed by now to the type of direct language on the part of Bergoglio, speaking of 'f*****ry' in the seminaries seems more like a bar and a tavern than a Pontiff,' he told la Repubblica.\n\n'This expression would never have appeared on the lips of Paul VI, John Paul II or Benedict XVI, who also took damning positions towards homosexuality.\n\nHe added: 'The Pope is right that the number of homosexual seminarians and clerics is very high. But the simplicity of language has nothing to do with vulgarity.'\n\nReports about the pontiff's remarks at the meeting come after bishops approved a document regulating admission to Italian seminaries, according to Corriere.\n\nThe Pope was pictured today (right) at a World Children's Day event in Rome\n\nBorn in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Francis' first language is Spanish, and though he is fluent in Italian he has made a number of linguistic faux pas in the past\n\nThe paper reported that members 'approved by majority vote an amendment that recognized the distinction between simple homosexual orientation and 'deeply rooted tendencies.'\n\nThis, it suggests, means 'in substance, that a homosexual person could be admitted to the seminary if, like the heterosexual, he gave the guarantee that he knows how to live the discipline of celibacy.'\n\nHowever, it reportedly implies 'that it is more difficult for homosexuals because they will be living in an all-male community for many years.'\n\nFrancis's latest remarks seemingly suggest he is taking 'a more radical' view on the issue, by preventing gay men from being allowed to join altogether.\n\nThe Holy See has not approved the document, according to reports, and the issue is still under discussion.\n\nThe 2005 Vatican document, released under Pope Benedict XVI and endorsed by Francis in 2016, states that the Church 'cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called 'gay culture.''\n\nThere is so far no official record of the Pope's latest comments on the issue and the Vatican has not commented.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

Credit - Franco Origlia -- Getty Images\n\nPope Francis apologized on Tuesday after he reportedly used a homophobic slur while reiterating his opposition to gay people becoming priests during a private discussion on the matter with bishops last week.\n\n\"There is already too much frociaggine\" in seminaries, Francis has been quoted as saying, using an Italian word that roughly translates to \"faggotry.\"\n\nThe remark, said to have been made during a closed-door meeting last Monday, was first reported by Italian news and gossip site Dagospia and then affirmed by Italian newspapers la Repubblica and Corriere della Sera, which each cited unnamed firsthand sources.\n\n\"The Pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he apologizes to those who felt offended by the use of a term, as reported by others,\" said Matteo Bruni, director of the Holy See Press Office, in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nRead More: Pope Francis Calls Surrogate Motherhood 'Deplorable,' Calls for Global Ban\n\nCorriere reported that the remark was received with incredulous laughter by the bishops in attendance and that, given the 87-year-old Argentinian pontiff's native language is Spanish, \"it was evident that the Pope was not aware of how offensive the word is in Italian.\"\n\nCatholic magazine America similarly reported that Francis' use of \"frociaggine\" was a \"gaffe\" rather than an intentional slur, \"given the pope's 'Who am I to judge?' attitude toward gay priests.\"\n\nFrancis was named TIME's 2013 Person of the Year after uttering those landmark five words 11 years ago that seemed at the time to herald a new era of acceptance and inclusion of LGBTQ people by the Catholic Church. Late last year, Francis gave his approval for priests to bless same-sex couples, and in February, he said he saw \"hypocrisy\" in those who criticized that decision.\n\nBut when it comes to gay people joining the priesthood, Francis has continued to back the Vatican's official policy, approved by his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI in 2005, that \"the Church, while profoundly respecting the persons in question, cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practise homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called 'gay culture.'\"\n\nIn 2018, during a similar closed-door meeting with Italian bishops, Francis reportedly warned that applicants to the priesthood should be vetted carefully and that anyone suspected of being homosexual should be rejected. \"If in doubt, better not let them enter,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\nRead More: Catholics Should Accept and Love All LGBTQ People\n\nAccording to Corriere, an assembly of bishops last November approved a potential reform, which yet required the pontiff's approval to be implemented, that would distinguish between \"simple homosexual orientation\" and \"deeply rooted tendencies\" -- and would permit the admission of people in the former category to seminaries so long as they could commit, like all seminarians, to a life of strict celibacy.\n\nWhen asked about this hypothetical approach, Francis reportedly \"responded in a firmly negative way,\" according to la Repubblica, which noted that he also emphasized respect is still owed to every person regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nFrancis explained, la Repubblica reported, as translated by America, \"it is necessary to put down markers, and prevent the risk that the gay person who chooses the priesthood could later end up living a double-life, continuing to practice homosexuality, while at the same time suffering from this dissimulation,\" before he made what seemed to be meant as a \"joke\" about the \"frociaggine\" that already exists in Italian seminaries.\n\nBruni's statement on Tuesday added: \"As [Pope Francis] has stated on many occasions, 'There is room for everyone in the Church, for everyone! No one is useless; no one is superfluous; there is room for everyone.

The meeting was held to discuss a new document describing training measures for soon-to-be priests studying in Italian seminaries.\n\nThe Catholic Church has historically banned gay men from becoming priests.\n\nAmid the discussion about gay men in Catholic seminaries, Italian media outlets claimed the Pope used an offensive slur. According to reports, the Pope said in Italian that gay men should not be permitted because there is already \"frociaggine\" (in English, translated to \"f -- tness,\" using a derogatory term for a gay man) in some seminaries.\n\nThe Pope's use of a slur was reported by the Italian outlets Dagospia, La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera, which quoted several unnamed bishops reportedly present during the meeting. One bishop told several of the papers he believed the Pope used the slur as a \"joke,\" while another said the pontiff may not have been aware the term is offensive, given Italian is not the Argentine Pope's first language.\n\n\"Pope Francis is aware of the recent articles regarding a closed-door conversation with the bishops of the CEI (Italian Bishops' Conference),\" Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said in the statement released Tuesday. \"As he has stated on many occasions, 'There is room for everyone in the Church, for everyone! No one is useless; no one is superfluous; there is room for everyone. Just as we are, everyone.'\"\n\nThe Pope's use of a homophobic slur is in contrast to his public urging that the church should welcome LGBTQ2 communities in an effort to become more inclusive.\n\nLast year, the Pope made the unprecedented decision to allow priests to bless same-sex couples, so long as the blessing is not confused with the ritual sacrament of marriage. The decision, as well as other more tolerant messages from the Pope to LGBTQ2 people, has been controversial in the Catholic community, with some disparaging the Vatican's position. Still, the Vatican has maintained that its teachings against same-sex marriage remain the same and that homosexual acts are sinful.\n\nThis is not the first time the Pope has said gay men should not join the clergy or study in seminaries. During a 2018 interview, the pontiff said homosexuality is a \"very serious issue\" and that the \"fashionable\" public perception toward gay people should not sway the Catholic Church.\n\n\"In consecrated and priestly life, there's no room for that kind of affection. Therefore, the church recommends that people with that kind of ingrained tendency should not be accepted into the ministry or consecrated life,\" the Pope said in 2018. \"The ministry or the consecrated life is not his place.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See_Press_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holy See Press Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corriere della Sera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pontiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Repubblica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Repubblica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian views on marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecrated_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consecrated life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consecration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Health_and_Wellness", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Health and Wellness", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2154358125.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C94px%2C3996px%2C2113px&resize=720%2C379", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 483, "textEnd": 489}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading... 2 men killed in early morning shooting at southwest Lincoln strip club Amie Just: Friday night football at Memorial Stadium is bound to be a logistical nightmare Tornado hits Lake McConaughy; trees damaged in Lincoln by overnight storms Nebraska wins its first Big Ten baseball tournament championship Owners of ex-Railyard restaurant ordered to pay $471K for back rent Nebraska football hosting Big Ten Friday night game on Fox Former Lincoln radio host Jack Riggins sues successor Dan Parsons for defamation 'Lincoln was really lucky' -- Beloved longtime child care center closes its doors Nebraska baseball punches ticket to Big Ten tournament championship game Lincoln singer Bryan Olesen takes third on 'The Voice' City of Lincoln ordered to pay $727K in attorney fees, costs in settled discrimination lawsuit Nebraska football notes: Former NU staffer named in lawsuit, ex-Huskers on the move Nebraska softball addresses roster holes with commitments from Camenzind twins Lincoln teen charged with first-degree murder of 16-year-old boy After recruiting snag, Kahmir Prescott regained his edge with belief from Nebraska\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nWith the statement, Bruni carefully avoided an outright confirmation that the pope had indeed used the term, in keeping with the Vatican's tradition of not revealing what the pope says behind closed doors. But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni emphasized that Francis did not intend to offend and extends apologies. The pope, known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, reaffirmed the Vatican's ban on gay priests.\n\nPope Francis apologised Tuesday after he was quoted using a vulgar term about gays to reaffirm the Catholic Church's ban on gay priests.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni issued a statement acknowledging the media storm that erupted about Francis' comments, which were delivered behind closed doors to Italian bishops on May 20.\n\nItalian media on Monday had quoted unnamed Italian bishops in reporting that Francis jokingly used the term \"faggotness\" while speaking in Italian during the encounter. He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a subsequent document in 2016, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture\".\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed that position in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge\" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Bruni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matteo Bruni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ordination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_for_Catholic_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congregation for Catholic Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linguistics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Sports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 19}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/16_05_2024_23_25_24_0081811.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 628, "textEnd": 634, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The Italian word roughly translates as \"faggotness\".\n\nMatteo Bruni, the director of the Vatican's press office, said Francis was aware of the newspaper reports about the closed-door conversation and \"apologises to those who felt offended by the use of the term, reported by others\".\n\n\"As he stated on several occasions, 'In the church there is room for everyone, for everyone. Nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, there is room for everyone. Just as we are, all of us,'\" said Bruni. \"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and apologises to those who felt offended by the use of a term, reported by others.\"\n\nThe discussion took place during an assembly of the Italian bishops conference (CEI), reportedly aimed at considering the question of whether gay men should be admitted to Catholic seminaries, where priests are trained.\n\nWhen one of the bishops asked Francis what he should do, the pope reportedly reiterated his objection to admitting gay men, saying that while it was important to embrace everyone, it was likely that a gay person could risk leading a double life. He is then alleged to have used the offensive word.\n\nThe story was first reported by the political gossip website Dagospia, before being covered by the Italian dailies La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera, and the news agency Adnkronos.\n\nLa Repubblica, Corriere and Adnkronos quoted unnamed bishops, who said that the pontiff meant the derogatory term as a \"joke\", and that those around him were surprised and perplexed by the alleged slur. One bishop told Corriere della Sera the Argentinian pontiff may not have been aware the term was offensive.\n\nSince he was elected pope in 2013, Francis has sought to adopt a more inclusive tone towards the LGBTQ+ community in his public statements, much to the disdain of conservative cardinals.\n\nSoon after becoming pope, he famously said in response to a question about gay priests: \"Who am I to judge?\"\n\nHe approved a ruling in December allowing priests to bless unmarried and same-sex couples in a significant change of position for the Catholic church.\n\nHowever, he has been clear about not allowing gay people to join the clergy. In an interview in 2018 he said he was \"concerned\" about what he described as the \"serious issue\" of homosexuality and that being gay was a \"fashion\" to which the clergy was susceptible.\n\n\"In our societies it even seems that homosexuality is fashionable, and that mentality, in some way, also influences the life of the church,\" he said at the time.\n\nThe Roman Catholic church's position is that homosexual acts are sinful. A decree on training for priests in 2016 emphasised the obligation of sexual abstinence, as well as barring gay men and those who support \"gay culture\" from holy orders.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pontiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See_Press_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holy See Press Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corriere della Sera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Repubblica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Repubblica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnkronos", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adnkronos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_orders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holy orders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abstinence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abstinence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Youth", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/d5a60316c0677559b9902d4c59ac99da", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

Official record of the event has not been released, and the Vatican Press Office did not respond to TIME's request for comment.\n\nRead More: Pope Francis Calls Surrogate Motherhood 'Deplorable,' Calls for Global Ban\n\nCorriere reported that the remark was received with incredulous laughter by the bishops in attendance and that, given the 87-year-old Argentinian pontiff's native language is Spanish, \"it was evident that the Pope was not aware of how offensive the word is in Italian.\"\n\nCatholic magazine America similarly reported that Francis' use of \"frociaggine\" was a \"gaffe\" rather than an intentional slur, \"given the pope's 'Who am I to judge?' attitude toward gay priests.\"\n\nFrancis was named TIME's 2013 Person of the Year after uttering those landmark five words 11 years ago that seemed at the time to herald a new era of acceptance and inclusion of LGBTQ people by the Catholic Church. Late last year, Francis gave his approval for priests to bless same-sex couples, and in February, he said he saw \"hypocrisy\" in those who criticized that decision.\n\nBut when it comes to gay people joining the priesthood, Francis has continued to back the Vatican's official policy, approved by his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI in 2005, that \"the Church, while profoundly respecting the persons in question, cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practise homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called 'gay culture.'\"\n\nIn 2018, during a similar closed-door meeting with Italian bishops, Francis reportedly warned that applicants to the priesthood should be vetted carefully and that anyone suspected of being homosexual should be rejected. \"If in doubt, better not let them enter,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\nRead More: Catholics Should Accept and Love All LGBTQ People\n\nAccording to Corriere, an assembly of bishops last November approved a potential reform, which yet required the pontiff's approval to be implemented, that would distinguish between \"simple homosexual orientation\" and \"deeply rooted tendencies\" -- and would permit the admission of people in the former category to seminaries so long as they could commit, like all seminarians, to a life of strict celibacy.\n\nWhen asked about this hypothetical approach, Francis reportedly \"responded in a firmly negative way,\" according to la Repubblica, which noted that he also emphasized respect is still owed to every person regardless of their sexual

He is then alleged to have added that there was already too much \"frociaggine\", a vulgar Italian word that roughly translates at \"faggotness\", in some seminaries.\n\nThe story was first reported by the political gossip website Dagospia, before being covered by the Italian dailies La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera, and the news agency Adnkronos.\n\nLa Repubblica, Corriere and Adnkronos quoted unnamed bishops, who said that the pontiff meant the derogatory term as a \"joke\", and that those around him were surprised and perplexed by the alleged slur. One bishop told Corriere della Sera that the pontiff might not have been aware that the term was offensive.\n\nLa Repubblica and Corriere reported that there was a meeting among bishops in November during which it was decided that homosexual men could be admitted to seminaries, so long as they did not practise their sexuality, but that the move was ultimately stopped by the pope.\n\nSince he was elected pope in 2013, Francis has sought to adopt a more inclusive tone towards the LGBTQ+ community in his public statements, much to the disdain of conservative cardinals.\n\nSoon after becoming pope, he famously said in response to a question about gay priests: \"Who am I to judge?\"\n\nHe approved a ruling in December allowing priests to bless unmarried and same-sex couples in what was a significant change of position for the Catholic church.\n\nHowever, he has been clear about not allowing gay people to join the clergy. In an interview in 2018 he said he was \"concerned\" about what he describes as the \"serious issue\" of homosexuality and that being gay is a \"fashion\" to which the clergy is susceptible.\n\n\"In our societies it even seems that homosexuality is fashionable, and that mentality, in some way, also influences the life of the church,\" he said at the time.\n\nThe Roman Catholic church's position is that homosexual acts are sinful.

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nWith the statement, Bruni carefully avoided an outright confirmation that the pope had indeed used the term, in keeping with the Vatican's tradition of not revealing what the pope says behind closed doors. But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

Over the decades, the community has made inroads into Israeli society, and most of them have citizenship or residency rights. But 130 members remain undocumented, and Israeli authorities have ordered them to leave. The orders have left dozens of people, some of whom have lived most of their lives in Israel, in an uncertain legal limbo.(AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo)\n\nMaya Alleruzzo\n\nA girl watches the sunset over the scenic Kadisha Valley, a holy landmark for Lebanon's Maronite Christians, in the northeast mountain town of Bcharre, Lebanon, Friday, July 21, 2023.

The Pope allegedly used the Roman term \"frociaggine,\" which translates to offensive English phrases. This comment was made during a private meeting held last week, according to Italy's largest news dailies, La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera.\n\nThe Telegraph UK reported that Francis stated there was \"too much faggotry\" among trainee priests. This statement could be perplexing for many who perceived the Pope as being compassionate toward gays in the Catholic Church. Additionally, he reportedly expressed his disapproval of seminarians living a \"double life\" by appearing to be celibate while actually being gay.\n\nDespite the meeting being private, BBC reports that these remarks were first disclosed via Dagospia, an Italian investigative website. The reports from La Repubblica were drawn from multiple unidentified sources. Corriere della Sera quoted anonymous bishops who suggested that the Pope might not have recognized the offensive nature of the Italian word he used.\n\nAt the beginning of his papacy in 2013, Francis famously declared, \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\" He recently caused controversy among Catholic traditionalists by suggesting that priests should have the authority to bless same-sex couples under certain conditions. Supporters argue that he occasionally uses incorrect Italian colloquialisms and may have been unaware of the potential offense.\n\nIn a 2018 meeting with Italian bishops, the Pope advised them to carefully evaluate candidates for the priesthood and reject those who appear to be homosexual, according to Reuters. Under Pope Benedict XVI, the Vatican declared in 2005 that those who had successfully overcome their homosexual tendencies for at least three years could be ordained as priests by the Church. The Vatican's statement also said that people who practice homosexuality should be prohibited from ordination.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with The Guardian, Pope Francis expressed his concern about what he views as the \"serious issue\" of homosexuality and stated that being gay is a \"fashion to which the clergy is vulnerable.\" The Roman Catholic Church maintains that homosexual behavior is immoral. A 2016 decree on priestly training emphasized the need for sexual abstinence and prohibited homosexual men and anyone who endorsed \"gay culture\" from entering holy orders.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corriere della Sera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Repubblica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "La Repubblica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_orders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holy orders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abstinence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abstinence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ordination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope Benedict XVI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colloquialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Health_and_Wellness", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Health and Wellness", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/31422771716884792.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The restriction is based on a 2005 document crafted under the administration of his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nThe Jesuit publication America reported the news on Monday, citing Italian media and an \"informed source, who did not want to be identified.\"\n\nLa Repubblica quoted Francis as saying that \"it is necessary to put down markers, and prevent the risk that the gay person who chooses the priesthood could later end up living a double-life, continuing to practice homosexuality, while at the same time suffering from this dissimulation.\"\n\nAlthough there is no official transcript of the speech, Francis reportedly used the Italian word \"frociaggine,\" a derogatory term for \"queerness\" that loosely translates in English to \"faggot.\"\n\nHe was quoted as saying, \"There is too much 'frociaggine' in seminaries.\" However, some believe Francis, whose native language is Spanish, may have mistakenly used the term. The Catholic News Service confirmed with unnamed Italian bishops that Francis used the term.\n\nThe Italian news outlet Corriere reported that the pope \"sometimes stumbles over somewhat creative Italian without being aware of the nuances,\" according to CNS.\n\nIn 2013, shortly after being made pope, Francis garnered international headlines when he appeared to endorse the idea that someone could be openly homosexual and a devout Christian.\n\nIn an interview he gave at the time following the Catholic event known as World Youth Day, a journalist asked Pope Francis if there was a gay lobby at the Vatican.\n\nFrancis responded, \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\" His comment was hailed by LGBT organizations and many news media outlets as a sign that the Catholic Church was evolving on LGBT issues.\n\nHowever, many at the time neglected to note that in the same interview, Francis declared that it was important to \"distinguish between a person who is gay and someone who makes a gay lobby,\" adding that \"a gay lobby isn't good.\"\n\nLast year, as part of an interview with the Argentine newspaper La Nacion to celebrate 10 years since he became head of the Roman Catholic Church, Francis denounced \"gender ideology,\" which is often defined as a set of views that considers gender a social construct and not based on biological sex.\n\n\"I always distinguish between what pastoral care is for people who have a different sexual orientation and what gender ideology is,\" he said at the time. \"They are two different things. Gender ideology, at this time, is one of the most dangerous ideological colonizations.\"\n\nIn December, with Francis' approval, the Vatican's Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a document allowing priests to provide blessings to same-sex couples. The document drew criticism, and the Vatican clarified that it would enable priests to \"bless couples in irregular situations and same-sex couples without officially validating their status or changing in any way the Church's perennial teaching on marriage.\"", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuits", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesuits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pope Benedict XVI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Repubblica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Repubblica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_News_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic News Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Youth_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Youth Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicastery_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-gender_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-gender movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT rights in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Youth", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/25/97/259744.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 358, "textEnd": 364}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

apologises after being quoted using vulgar term about gay men", "body": "The controversy highlights ongoing tensions between the Vatican's stance on gay priests and the presence of LGBTQ+ individuals within the church.\n\nPope Francis has apologised after he was quoted using a vulgar and derogatory term about gay men to reaffirm the Catholic Church's ban on gay priests.\n\nThe ruckus that ensued underscored how the church's official teaching about homosexuality often bumps up against the unacknowledged reality that there are plenty of gay men in the priesthood, and plenty of LGBTQ+ Catholics who want to be fully part of the life and sacraments of the church.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni issued a statement acknowledging the media storm that erupted about Francis' comments, which were delivered behind closed doors to Italian bishops on May 20.\n\nItalian media had quoted unnamed Italian bishops in reporting that, while speaking in Italian during the encounter, Francis jokingly used a term which translates in English to \"faggotness\".\n\nHe had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nWith the statement, Bruni carefully avoided an outright confirmation that the pope had indeed used the term, in keeping with the Vatican's tradition of not revealing what the pope says behind closed doors.\n\nBut Bruni also didn't deny that Francis had said it.\n\nAnd for those who have long advocated for greater inclusion and acceptance of LGBTQ+ Catholics, the issue was bigger than the word itself.\n\n\"More than the offensive slur uttered by the pope, what is damaging is the institutional church's insistence on 'banning' gay men from the priesthood as if we all do not know (and minister alongside) many, many gifted, celibate, gay priests,\" noted Natalia Imperatori-Lee, chair of the religious studies department at Manhattan College.\n\n\"The LGBTQ community seems to be a constant target of offhand, off-the-cuff 'mistakes' from people in the Vatican, including the pope, who should know better,\" she added.\n\nThe 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge\" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past.\n\nHe has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime\".\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin.\n\nHe later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism\".\n\nBut the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day\".\n\nAndrea Rubera, a spokesperson for Paths of Hope, an Italian association of LGBTQ+ Christians, said he was incredulous when he first read about the pope's comments, and then sad when no denial came from the Vatican.\n\nIt showed, he said, that the pope and the Vatican still have a \"limited view\" of the reality of LGBTQ+ people.\n\n\"We hope, once again, that the time will come to undertake a discussion in the church toward a deepening of the LGBT issue, especially from the experience of the people themselves,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"},

The pope expressed that homosexual men should not be allowed to train as priests even if they pledge to remain celibate.\n\nMany suspect that a major reason this topic was being brought up is due to the influx of child sexual assault lawsuits being brought forth against members of the Catholic church.\n\nMeanwhile, Matteo Bruni, the director of the Holy See Press Office, issued a statement acknowledging criticism from the LGBTQ+ community, and discussing the comments that were delivered behind closed doors to Italian bishops on May 20.\n\nThe pope \"never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he apologizes to those who felt offended by the use of a term reported by others,\" said Bruni.\n\n\"In the Church there is room for everyone, for everyone! Nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, there is room for everyone. Just as we are, all of us,\" Pope Francis later said in a statement.\n\nThe comments were first reported on the Italian tabloid website Dagospia.\n\nPope Francis has been portrayed previously as being publicly respectful towards the LGBTQ+ community.

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

But 130 members remain undocumented, and Israeli authorities have ordered them to leave.

The pope used the Italian term \"frociaggine,\" a rarely used slur to describe flamboyant gay attitudes. Francis allegedly also used other disparaging words to describe gays.\n\n\"The pope never meant to offend or express himself with homophobic terms, and he issues his most sincere apologies to all those who felt offended by the use of a term reported by others,\" read a statement by Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni on Tuesday (May 28).\n\nThe Vatican did not deny that the pope used those terms and offered no clarification on who were the \"others\" who reported the pope's words.\n\nThe statement clarified that the pope is aware of the news reports regarding his private meeting with the Italian bishops and that Francis wants to reiterate his belief that \"in the church there is place for everyone, for everyone! No one is useless, no one is superfluous, there is space for everyone. Just the way we are, everyone.\"\n\nThe Italian bishops, who were convened for the national assembly meeting in Rome, are considering relaxing the ban on admitting gay men to the seminary.\n\nIndividuals who are engaging in same-sex sexual encounters or have \"deeply rooted homosexual tendencies\" are not allowed to enter the seminary, according to a 2005 Vatican instruction. Inspired by the pope's opening toward LGBTQ faithful, Italian bishops are discussing the possibility of removing the ban on those who have gay tendencies.\n\nDuring the meeting, which lasted an hour and a half, the pope allegedly stated that the church should continue to bar entry to the priesthood to gay men. After his famous words \"who am I to judge?\" in answering a question on gay priests, Pope Francis' new comments struck many faithful as contradictory.\n\n\"When Pope Francis' private conversations are made public, it's always difficult to understand the full meaning of what he is saying,\" said Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, a Catholic ministry to LGBTQ faithful in the U.S., in a message to Religion News Service on Tuesday.\n\n\"His apology is a model for all Catholic leaders who continue to use language and ideas that offend LGBTQ+ people,\" he added.\n\n\"It is disappointing, however, that the pope did not clarify more specifically what he meant by banning gay men from the priesthood. Without a clarification, it would seem that his words intend a blanket ban on all gay men,\" DeBernardo said.\n\nDeBernardo questioned whether the pope was aware of how offensive his words were and whether Francis was referring to men who are in gay sexual relationships when addressing the priesthood.\n\n\"These possible explanations, however, do not excuse the pope's comments,\" he added. \"Pope Francis has not always been clear in his remarks about LGBTQ+ people. We hope this incident will encourage him to learn more about the language he uses, and about how misuse can be dangerously harmful.\"\n\nThe pope has seemed to offer an unprecedented opening toward LGBTQ faithful, meeting with gay dignitaries and advocates at the Vatican, supporting the pastoral outreach to the LGBTQ community of Jesuit priest James Martin and helping trans communities.\n\nBut the pope's words of welcoming to LGBTQ faithful have not led to any change to the church's teachings on homosexuality, including that gay acts are a sin. Last year, the Vatican's Department for the Doctrine of the Faith cautiously allowed priests to bless same-sex couples, but the pope took a step back on the historic decision by stating that gay unions cannot be blessed because they are contrary to natural law in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that aired May 20.\n\nIn the same interview, Francis said that gay people can be blessed as individuals and that \"everyone\" is welcome in the church.\n\nThe long speech to Italian bishops was delivered in Italian, which isn't the pope's native language, but this isn't the first time Francis has used colorful language to get his message across. While speaking to sex abuse victims in Dublin in 2018, the pope said that priests who covered up abuse are \"shit\" and he has accused media outlets of \"coprophilia,\" meaning that they are aroused by excrement.\n\nThe pope's comments come shortly before Rome's gay pride parade, which is set to take place on June 15.", "source": {"uri": "religionnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Religion

(FILIPPO MONTEFORTE/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nPope Francis is in hot water after reportedly using a derogatory term for gay men when discussing and reaffirming the Vatican's long-standing ban on gay priests behind closed doors to Italian bishops.\n\nWhile there may not be an official transcript or confirmation of Pope Francis' comments, on Tuesday, the Pope apologized for his use of the term, allegedly targeting gay men. The Vatican's spokesperson issued a statement acknowledging the backlash and media frenzy that has followed the comments made on May 20.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others,\" the spokesperson said. However, they avoided outright confirming that the pope had used the term, in line with the Vatican's tradition of keeping conversations that happen behind closed doors secret. However, the spokesperson did not deny that Francis used the term, The Associated Press reported.\n\nItalian media like gossip website Dagospia and then mainstream outlets were the first to report on the incident, citing that Francis, a native Spanish speaker, who is also fluent in the Vatican's official language, Italian, had said \"f*****ness\" in Italian.\n\nAccording to reporting done by NBC News, sources in the room said that the conversation was about the acceptance of gay men into seminaries when Francis said that the seminaries were already too full of an Italian slang term \"that represents a vulgar way to refer to a gay person.\" After the use of the slur, the audience of bishops was surprised given that the pope has openly been accepting of the LGBTQ+ community in the church and at large, NBC News said.\n\nThe reception of Francis' comments has not been received kindly by Italian media. The controversy comes as a shock as Francis has been widely regarded as one of the most liberal popes in history. He has recently allowed priests to bless individuals in gay marriages, opened the Vatican to transgender sex workers, instilled more women in the church and even called an end to anti-gay legislation.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press last year, the pope said, \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\" During another interview with \"60 Minutes\" reporter Norah O'Donnell last week, she asked the pope about his comment that \"Homosexuality is not a crime,\" to which he responded, \"No, it is a human fact.\"\n\nVatican reporter Gerry O'Connell, a non-native Italian speaker, said in America Magazine that the pope's remark was \"a gaffe on the part of the pope, rather than a slur.\"\n\n\"As he has had the opportunity to state on several occasions, 'In the Church there is room for everyone, for everyone! No one is useless, no one is superfluous, there is room for everyone. Just as we are, everyone,'\" the Vatican spokesperson said.\n\nDespite Francis' liberal views, in April, the Vatican blasted gender-affirming surgery and surrogacy as a violation of human dignity. The church similarly sees gender-affirming care as on par with abortion and euthanasia, saying it rejects God's plan for human life, The Associated Press reported. In his interview with O'Donnell, Francis also clarified that the church has not allowed priests to bless the union of gay marriages, \"That cannot be done because that is not the sacrament. I cannot . . . To bless a homosexual-type union, however, goes against the given right, against the law of the Church.

The surprising comments come as the 87-year-old Pope is one of the leading voices towards a more welcoming approach towards the LGBT community.\n\nThe Pope was quoted as saying by two of Italy's largest newspapers that seminaries, or priesthood colleges, are already too full of \"frociaggine\", a vulgar Italian term roughly translating as \"faggotness\". La Repubblica attributed its story to several unspecified sources, while Corriere della Sera newspaper said it was backed up by a few, unnamed bishops who suggested that the Pope might not have realised that the Italian remark he used was offensive.\n\nThe alleged incident happened on May 20, when the Italian Bishops Conference opened a four-day assembly with a non-public meeting with the pontiff. Pope Francis has so far been credited with leading the Roman Catholic Church into taking a more welcoming approach towards the LGBT community. However, he delivered a similar message in 2018 when he told bishops to carefully vet priesthood applicants and reject suspected homosexuals.\n\nIn 2013, at the start of his papacy, he famously said, \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\", while last year he allowed priests to bless members of same-sex couples, triggering substantial conservative backlash. His approval to Catholic priests blessing same-sex couples was heralded by some as a step towards breaking down discrimination in the Catholic Church.\n\nHowever, the Pope maintained its strict ban on gay marriage. The new document repeats that condition and elaborates on it, reaffirming that marriage is a lifelong union between a man and a woman. The Vatican holds that marriage is an indissoluble union between man and woman. As a result, it has long opposed same-sex marriage and considers homosexual acts to be \"intrinsically disordered.\"\n\nThe move by Francis angered traditionalists, with blogger Luigi Casalini of Messa writing in Latino (Latin Mass) blog that the document appeared to be a form of heresy. University of Notre Dame theologian Ulrich Lehner was also concerned, saying it would merely sow confusion and could lead to division in the church. However, Francis has distinguished himself from all his predecessors with his message of welcome towards the community.\n\nPope Francis defended the landmark decision approving blessings for same-sex couples suggesting that those in the Catholic Church who have resisted it have jumped to \"ugly conclusions\" because they do not understand it. \"The danger is that if I don't like something and I put it (the opposition) in my heart, I become a resistance and jump to ugly conclusions,\" he said during a link from his Vatican residence with the \"Che Tempo Che Fa\" program on Italy's Channel 9.\n\nFrancis said that those who do not like decisions such as the one on same-sex blessings should make their doubts known and engage in \"fraternal discussions\". In a 2005 document, released under Francis's late predecessor Benedict XVI, the Vatican said the Church could admit into the priesthood those who had clearly overcome homosexual tendencies for at least three years.\n\n(with inputs from Reuters)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priesthood_in_the_Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Priesthood in the Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corriere della Sera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Repubblica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Repubblica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridentine_Mass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tridentine Mass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope Benedict XVI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Notre Dame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heresy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Law", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/05/pope-francis-1716878433.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 906, "textEnd": 912}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Unlike some Orthodox clergy, Roman Catholic priests are forbidden from marrying.\n\nPope Francis has been known for LGBT outreach since the start of his papacy in 2013, from ministering to transgender Catholics to allowing priests to bless same-sex couples. In an interview last year, he argued that homosexuality was \"not a crime\" - but maintained that Catholicism regarded it as a sin, just like any sex outside of marriage.\n\nJust last month, however, the Roman Catholic Church denounced surrogacy and so-called \"gender-affirming\" surgery as being on par with abortion and euthanasia.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rt@rt.com", "name": "RT", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pontiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corriere della Sera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Repubblica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Repubblica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surrogacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ordination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Orthodox Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Family_and_Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Family and Relationships", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.05/article/665610d92030273be46b35b8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The Vatican press office declined multiple requests for comment.\n\nLeading Italian newspapers La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera said May 27 they confirmed with unnamed Italian bishops that Pope Francis had used the vulgar slang, although Corriere also noted that the pope \"sometimes stumbles over somewhat creative Italian without being aware of the nuances.\"\n\nLa Repubblica said, \"The word made more than one bishop flinch. The man (Pope Francis) is no stranger to verbal intemperance; the meeting was behind closed doors, the conversation informal, but when Pope Francis used that word\" there was tension in the room.\n\nWhile Pope Francis insisted to the bishops that LGBTQ+ Catholics must be accepted in the church and treated with respect, he reportedly said at the meeting that it is better not to accept gay men as candidates for the priesthood.\n\nDuring a similar closed-door meeting with Italian bishops in 2018, La Repubblica reported, the pope told them if they had \"even the slightest doubt\" about a gay candidate being able to live a life of celibacy in the seminary and as a priest, \"it is better not to let them in.\"\n\nIn a book-length interview in 2018, Pope Francis had said superiors must be able to help gay candidates prepare for a life of celibacy or encourage them to leave the seminary.\n\n\"Homosexuality is a very serious matter, which must be discerned adequately from the beginning with candidates, if it is the case. We must be demanding,\" the pope had told Claretian Father Fernando Prado in the book-interview, \"The Strength of Vocation: Consecrated Life Today.\"\n\nPope Francis made it clear in the interview that he was talking about homosexual activity among priests and religious who make vows of chastity and celibacy.\n\n\"In consecrated life or that of the priesthood, there is no place for this type of affection,\" the pope said. \"For that reason, the church recommends that persons with this deep-seated tendency not be accepted for ministry or consecrated life.\"\n\nA 2005 instruction from the then-Congregation for Catholic Education, approved by Pope Benedict XVI, said the church \"cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called 'gay culture.'\"\n\nBishops and superiors of religious orders, who are responsible for the final decision about admitting candidates to the priesthood and religious life, have continued to discuss and debate the meaning of \"deep-seated homosexual tendencies,\" which apparently was what prompted the question to the pope during his meeting with the Italian bishops' conference.", "source": {"uri": "thebostonpilot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Pilot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cindy_wooden@thebostonpilot.com", "name": "Cindy Wooden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Repubblica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "La Repubblica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priesthood_in_the_Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Priesthood in the Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corriere della Sera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_orders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holy orders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecrated_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consecrated life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope Benedict XVI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religious order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_vows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religious vows"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Health_and_Wellness", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Health and Wellness", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.thebostonpilot.com/news/20240528/images/700x450_CNS_31289.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 337, "textEnd": 343}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 587, "textEnd": 593}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Since he first declared \"who am I to judge\" shortly after becoming pope in 2013, Francis has gone further than any pontiff in building bridges to gay Catholics.\n\nIn the meeting with Italian bishops, however, the pope was quoted as using the word \"frociaggine,\" which in Roman Italian dialect roughly translates as \"faggotness.\"\n\n\"The pope must explain himself,\" said the Rev. Wolfgang Rothe, an openly gay German Catholic priest serving in the archdiocese of Munich, who said he was writing a protest letter to Francis and requesting a meeting with him in Vatican City. \"I am not certain he understands [the term], but I think he does, and it makes me sad. A pope should not speak in such a manner.\"\n\nIn a statement to journalists, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni offered verbal acrobatics. Without specifically confirming the pope's use of the term, he said Francis was aware of the reports of his words at the closed-door session.\n\n\"The Pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he apologizes to those who felt offended by the use of a term reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nHe emphasized that the pope believes \"in the Church there is room for everyone, for everyone! Nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, there is room for everyone. Just as we are, all of us.\"\n\nFrancis invoked the slur while reiterating to bishops his opposition to gay men studying for the priesthood, a subject some watchers took more seriously than the slur. A senior Vatican official familiar with the comments, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, confirmed the pontiff had uttered the pejorative during his May 20 closed-door meeting with the Italian Episcopal Conference held at a Vatican City auditorium and in which more than 200 bishops were in attendance.\n\nIt was possible, the person said, that Francis was not \"aware\" of the extent of the word's negative connotation: \"His 'who am I to judge' stance remains\" the pope's position, the official said.\n\nSome Vatican watchers sought to downplay the significance of an 87-year-old man colloquially deploying such language, particularly in the context of the pope's landmark outreach to the gay community. They portrayed his use of the term as the kind of verbal gaffe an elderly uncle or grandfather might make, or that perhaps the pontiff didn't fully appreciate how negative the term sounds in Italian. The Italian outlet Corriere della Sera noted that the pope has sometimes referenced mental illness while apparently not meaning to by mixing up the Italian words for \"psychiatric\" and \"psychological.\"\n\nA second Vatican official familiar with the pope's lexicon in private and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue said the pontiff has used the term \"frociaggine\" before. The person said the pope uses the word not as a catchall for homosexual men, but for anyone, gay or straight, who forms closed, gossipy cliques.\n\nBut the pope - a native Spanish speaker born into an Italian family in Argentina - has spoken Italian from an early age, and others argued there is little chance he did not understand the word's meaning, even if he did not mean to wield it maliciously.\n\n\"It's widely known inside of the Vatican that, when angered, Pope Francis will resort to colorful language,\" said Lucetta Scaraffia, a church historian and former editor of a Vatican magazine.\n\nThe pope has a history of being, at times, less than reverent. In 2020, he apologized for slapping the hand of a woman who had grabbed him during a New Year's Eve event, and in 2016, he derided a crowd in Mexico as \"selfish\" after he was yanked by his robes into a man in a wheelchair.\n\nBut his use of the loaded term for gay men last week, observers say, was seen as more jarring - particularly among those in Catholic LGBTQ+ ministry who have hailed the pontiff's outreach and landmark gestures.\n\n\"I think this constitutes a heavy blow to Francis's prestige,\" said Marco Politi, a Rome-based author of several books on Francis. \"Because a pope is not to use those words, neither in private nor in public. Among both Catholics and non-Catholics who admire the pope, I have witnessed a devastating impact, whereas on the right, among those who never loved the pope, they're quite happy with the pope using words interpreted as homophobic. This is quite a dramatic incident, although Francis has wisely backtracked.\"\n\nFrancis's track record, his defenders say, speaks for itself. In December, Francis approved a highly polemic new policy allowing Catholic priests to offer short blessings to same-sex couples, a decision that came just one month after he explicitly permitted transgender godparents and baptisms for transgender people. In recent years, he has welcomed nearly 100 transgender women to the Vatican, publicly denounced anti-gay laws, backed secular civil unions for same-sex couples and pronounced that \"homosexuality is not a crime.\"\n\nYet, the same pope has also compared \"gender theory\" to nuclear weapons and signed off on a Vatican document in April that questioned whether \"sex change surgery\" was an affront to human dignity.\n\nThe substance of his latest comments did not break new ground. The pope has already drawn a sharp line between pastoral acceptance of LGBTQ+ Catholics and the admission of homosexual men into ordained ministry. Francis has backed a 2005 Vatican ruling not to allow gay men in the priesthood, a decision that argued \"homosexual candidates cannot become priests because their sexual orientation estranges them from the proper sense of paternity.\" In 2018, the pope told prelates gathered at the same General Assembly of the Italian Episcopal Conference that \"even the slightest doubt\" that a seminary candidate is gay should be enough to bar him from the seminary.\n\nHis comments last week came as Italian bishops have been studying softer language that could have opened the door to more openly gay, if celibate, priests. Francis seemed to frown on that prospect, which critics saw as a setback.\n\nThe papal apology \"confirms our thought that use of the slur was a careless colloquialism,\" said Francis DeBernardo, executive director of U.S.-based New Ways Ministry, which does Catholic LGBTQ+ outreach. \"We are disappointed, however, that the pope did not clarify specifically what he meant by banning gay men from the priesthood. Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary.\"\n\nThe pope, who often speaks colloquially in private, said last week that in seminaries today, there is already too much \"frociaggine.\" The Italian gossip site Dagospia first reported the pope's use of the phrase. Major Italian outlets Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica later said they had confirmed the report, citing unnamed sources. Dagospia also reported the pope had additionally used the word \"checche,\" or \"pansies.\"\n\nThe Global Network of Rainbow Catholics, a pro-LGBTQ+ group, suggested the leak from a private meeting with Francis may have been an act of sabotage by conservative critics out to sully Francis.\n\n\"There is definitely mischief afoot to try and undermine Pope Francis,\" the group said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stefano_pitrelli@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Stefano Pitrelli", "type":

At that meeting the pope was asked about the admission of declared gay men to the seminary.\n\nTelling the bishops that gay men should not be admitted to priestly formation, the pope argued \"there is too much 'frociaggine' in seminaries,\" a slur translated as \"faggotry\" or \"faggotness.\"\n\nBruni told journalists that the pope \"never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he apologizes to those who felt offended by the use of a term reported by others.\"\n\nThe remarks were first reported by the Italian tabloid website Dagospia and later confirmed by major Italian newspapers La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera.\n\nQuoting several unnamed bishops, Corriere della Sera suggested that the pope did not understand the gravity of the term in Italian.\n\nThe Vatican nearly two decades ago addressed the topic of gay-identified men entering Catholic seminaries. In 2005 the Congregation for Catholic Education issued an instruction titled \"Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with Regard to Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in View of Their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders.\"\n\nThe document stated that \"it is necessary to state clearly that the Church, while profoundly respecting the persons in question, cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies, or support the so-called 'gay culture.'\"\n\nThe instruction went on to note the difference between those who display \"deep-seated homosexual tendencies\" and those \"dealing with homosexual tendencies that were only the expression of a transitory problem.\"\n\nPope Francis upheld the ruling in 2016. In 2018 he again told Italian bishops to carefully vet candidates.\n\nLa Repubblica noted the Italian bishops during their meeting in Assisi last November approved a new Ratio Formationis Sacerdotalis, a document detailing the admission criteria and standards for men in Italy's seminaries.\n\nThe Italian paper added that the document \"has been under consideration by the Vatican Dicastery for the Clergy for final approval.\"\n\nPapal biographer Austen Ivereigh wrote on X on Tuesday that the pope's \"concern is with gay men seeing the priesthood as a way of living out their sexuality, and the gay subculture in many seminaries.\"\n\nThe pope has at times been hailed for his outreach to the LGBT-identified community.\n\nDuring an in-flight press conference in 2013, the pope responded to a question from a journalist on his experience as a confessor to homosexual persons by asking rhetorically: \"Who am I to judge that person?\"\n\nThe pope expanded on these remarks in a 2016 book-length interview titled \"The Name of God Is Mercy,\" where he said he was \"paraphrasing by heart\" the Catechism of the Church, which states that \"these people should be treated with delicacy and not be marginalized.\"\n\n\"I am glad that we are talking about 'homosexual people,'\" the pope continued, \"because before all else comes the individual person, in his wholeness and dignity.\"\n\nIn December of last year, meanwhile, the Vatican's Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith issued Fiducia Supplicans, a declaration allowing for nonliturgical blessings for couples in \"irregular\" situations, including same-sex couples.\n\nResponding to the strong criticism the document received, Pope Francis said in February that to be \"scandalized\" by gay couple blessings is \"hypocrisy.\"\n\n\"No one is scandalized if I give a blessing to an entrepreneur who perhaps exploits people: and this is a very serious sin,\" the pope said in the interview to the Italian weekly print periodical Credere.\n\n\"Whereas they are scandalized if I give it to a homosexual ... This is hypocrisy! We must all respect each other. Everyone,\" the Holy Father said.\n\nTags:LGBTQMatthew Santuccipope francisseminariansseminary\n\nPrevious post\n\nSeek the Lord for June 2024\n\nNext post\n\nThis is the most recent story.\n\nThe

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose 1 of 26\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

It is extremely rare for a pope to issue a public apology.\n\n\"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he apologises to those who felt offended by the use of a term reported by others,\" Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in an emailed statement. Italian media had reported on Monday that Francis used the Italian term \"frociaggine\", roughly translating as \"faggotness\" or \"faggotry\", as he told Italian bishops he remained opposed to admitting gay people into the priesthood.\n\nItalian political gossip website Dagospia was the first to report on the alleged incident, said to have happened on May 20 when the pontiff met Italian bishops behind closed doors. One daily, Corriere della Sera, quoted unnamed bishops who were in the room as suggesting that the pope, as an Argentine, might not have realised that the Italian term he used was offensive.\n\nBruni said Francis was \"aware\" of the various articles.

as \"faggotness\" or \"faggotry\", as he told Italian bishops he remained opposed to admitting gay people into the priesthood.\n\nItalian political gossip website Dagospia was the first to report on the alleged incident, said to have happened on May 20 when the pontiff met Italian bishops behind closed doors.\n\nOne daily, Corriere della Sera, quoted unnamed bishops who were in the room as suggesting that the pope, as an Argentine, might not have realised that the Italian term he used was offensive.\n\nBruni said Francis was \"aware\" of the various articles.\n\nThe Vatican spokesman reiterated that the pope remained committed to a welcoming Church for all, where \"nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, (where) there is room for everyone\".\n\nNevertheless, his reported remarks caused shock and consternation.\n\nMarianne Duddy-Burke, the head of LGBT Catholic rights group DignityUSA, called them \"shocking and hurtful to many, especially to the innumerable gay priests who have served God's people faithfully and well\".\n\n\"Unfortunately, even if intended as a joke, the pope's comment reveals the depth of anti-gay bias and institutional discrimination that still exist in our church,\" Duddy-Burke added.\n\nVito Mancuso, an Italian theologian and former priest, told daily La Stampa that Francis' language was \"despicable and surprising because it blatantly jars\" with his previous messages on LGBT issues.\n\nFrancis, who is 87, has been credited with making substantial overtures towards the LGBT community during his 11-year papacy.\n\nIn 2013, at the start of his papacy, he famously said: \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\" Last year he allowed priests to bless members of same-sex couples, triggering a substantial conservative backlash.\n\nBack in 2018, Francis admitted making \"grave mistakes\" in the handling of a sexual abuse crisis in Chile, where he initially dismissed as slander accusations against a bishop suspected of protecting a predator priest.\n\n\"I apologise to all those I have offended and I hope to be able to do it personally in the coming weeks, in the meetings I will have (with

Francis' apology Tuesday, May 28, 2024, for using a vulgar term to refer to gay men was the latest comment to make headlines about the Catholic Church's teachings on homosexuality. AP Photo/Andrew Medichini, File\n\nROME -- Pope Francis on Tuesday issued a rare apology after he was accused of using a highly pejorative slur to refer to gay men in a closed-door session with bishops last week.\n\nThe pope's choice of words, reported by major Italian news outlets and confirmed to The Washington Post by a senior Vatican official, appeared to run counter to his efforts to thaw the relationship between the Catholic Church and the LGBTQ+ community. Since he first declared \"who am I to judge\" shortly after becoming pope in 2013, Francis has gone further than any pontiff in building bridges to gay Catholics.\n\nIn the meeting with Italian bishops, however, the pope was quoted as using the word \"frociaggine,\" which in Roman Italian dialect roughly translates as \"faggotness.\"\n\n\"The pope must explain himself,\" said the Rev. Wolfgang Rothe, an openly gay German Catholic priest serving in the archdiocese of Munich, who said he was writing a protest letter to Francis and requesting a meeting with him in Vatican City. \"I am not certain he understands [the term], but I think he does, and it makes me sad. A pope should not speak in such a manner.\"\n\nIn a statement to journalists, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni offered verbal acrobatics. Without specifically confirming the pope's use of the term, he said Francis was aware of the reports of his words at the closed-door session.\n\n\"The Pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he apologizes to those who felt offended by the use of a term reported by others,\" Bruni said.\n\nHe emphasized that the pope believes \"in the Church there is room for everyone, for everyone! Nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, there is room for everyone. Just as we are, all of us.\"\n\nFrancis invoked the slur while reiterating to bishops his opposition to gay men studying for the priesthood, a subject some watchers took more seriously than the slur. A senior Vatican official familiar with the comments, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, confirmed the pontiff had uttered the pejorative during his May 20 closed-door meeting with the Italian Episcopal Conference held at a Vatican City auditorium and in which more than 200 bishops were in attendance.\n\nIt was possible, the person said, that Francis was not \"aware\" of the extent of the word's negative connotation: \"His 'who am I to judge' stance remains\" the pope's position, the official said.\n\nSome Vatican watchers sought to downplay the significance of an 87-year-old man colloquially deploying such language, particularly in the context of the pope's landmark outreach to the gay community. They portrayed his use of the term as the kind of verbal gaffe an elderly uncle or grandfather might make, or that perhaps the pontiff didn't fully appreciate how negative the term sounds in Italian. The Italian outlet Corriere della Sera noted that the pope has sometimes referenced mental illness while apparently not meaning to by mixing up the Italian words for \"psychiatric\" and \"psychological.\"\n\nA second Vatican official familiar with the pope's lexicon in private and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue said the pontiff has used the term \"frociaggine\" before. The person said the pope uses the word not as a catchall for homosexual men, but for anyone, gay or straight, who forms closed, gossipy cliques.\n\nBut the pope - a native Spanish speaker born into an Italian family in Argentina - has spoken Italian from an early age, and others argued there is little chance he did not understand the word's meaning, even if he did not mean to wield it maliciously.\n\n\"It's widely known inside of the Vatican that, when angered, Pope Francis will resort to colorful language,\" said Lucetta Scaraffia, a church historian and former editor of a Vatican magazine.\n\nThe pope has a history of being, at times, less than reverent. In 2020, he apologized for slapping the hand of a woman who had grabbed him during a New Year's Eve event, and in 2016, he derided a crowd in Mexico as \"selfish\" after he was yanked by his robes into a man in a wheelchair.\n\nBut his use of the loaded term for gay men last week, observers say, was seen as more jarring - particularly among those in Catholic LGBTQ+ ministry who have hailed the pontiff's outreach and landmark gestures.\n\n\"I think this constitutes a heavy blow to Francis's prestige,\" said Marco Politi, a Rome-based author of several books on Francis. \"Because a pope is not to use those words, neither in private nor in public. Among both Catholics and non-Catholics who admire the pope, I have witnessed a devastating impact, whereas on the right, among those who never loved the pope, they're quite happy with the pope using words interpreted as homophobic. This is quite a dramatic incident, although Francis has wisely backtracked.\"\n\nFrancis's track record, his defenders say, speaks for itself. In December, Francis approved a highly polemic new policy allowing Catholic priests to offer short blessings to same-sex couples, a decision that came just one month after he explicitly permitted transgender godparents and baptisms for transgender people. In recent years, he has welcomed nearly 100 transgender women to the Vatican, publicly denounced anti-gay laws, backed secular civil unions for same-sex couples and pronounced that \"homosexuality is not a crime.\"\n\nYet, the same pope has also compared \"gender theory\" to nuclear weapons and signed off on a Vatican document in April that questioned whether \"sex change surgery\" was an affront to human dignity.\n\nThe substance of his latest comments did not break new ground. The pope has already drawn a sharp line between pastoral acceptance of LGBTQ+ Catholics and the admission of homosexual men into ordained ministry. Francis has backed a 2005 Vatican ruling not to allow gay men in the priesthood, a decision that argued \"homosexual candidates cannot become priests because their sexual orientation estranges them from the proper sense of paternity.\" In 2018, the pope told prelates gathered at the same General Assembly of the Italian Episcopal Conference that \"even the slightest doubt\" that a seminary candidate is gay should be enough to bar him from the seminary.\n\nHis comments last week came as Italian bishops have been studying softer language that could have opened the door to more openly gay, if celibate, priests. Francis seemed to frown on that prospect, which critics saw as a setback.\n\nThe papal apology \"confirms our thought that use of the slur was a careless colloquialism,\" said Francis DeBernardo, executive director of U.S.-based New Ways Ministry, which does Catholic LGBTQ+ outreach. \"We are disappointed, however, that the pope did not clarify specifically what he meant by banning gay men from the priesthood. Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary.\"\n\nThe pope, who often speaks colloquially in private, said last week that in seminaries today, there is already too much \"frociaggine.\" The Italian gossip site Dagospia first reported the pope's use of the phrase. Major Italian outlets Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica later said they had confirmed the report, citing unnamed sources. Dagospia also reported the pope had additionally used the word \"checche,\" or \"pansies.\"\n\nThe Global Network of Rainbow Catholics, a pro-LGBTQ+ group, suggested the leak from a private meeting with Francis may have been an act of sabotage by conservative critics out to sully Francis.\n\n\"There is definitely mischief afoot to try and undermine Pope Francis,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nMelinda French Gates to donate $1 billion in support of

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis had used the term and acknowledged that some people had been offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a subsequent document in 2016, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men had left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \" Being homosexual is not a crime. \"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgenewsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lethbridge News Now"},

The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ordination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_for_Catholic_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congregation for Catholic Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linguistics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Sports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/B0tajUG7u0BkGp8UIB34mi-ov7Y=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/57WN7ESAIK264KXVBMEAUXKXTU.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 1397, "textEnd": 1403}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

At that meeting the Pope was asked about the admission of declared gay men to the seminary.\n\nTelling the bishops that gay men should not be admitted to priestly formation, the Pope argued \"there is too much 'frociaggine' in seminaries,\" a slur translated as \"faggotry\" or \"faggotness.\"\n\nBruni told journalists that the Pope \"never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he apologizes to those who felt offended by the use of a term reported by others.\"\n\nThe remarks were first reported by the Italian tabloid website Dagospia and later confirmed by major Italian newspapers La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera.\n\nQuoting several unnamed bishops, Corriere della Sera suggested that the Pope did not understand the gravity of the term in Italian.\n\nThe Vatican nearly two decades ago addressed the topic of gay-identified men entering Catholic seminaries. In 2005 the Congregation for Catholic Education issued an instruction titled \"Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with Regard to Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in View of Their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders.\"\n\nThe document stated that \"it is necessary to state clearly that the Church, while profoundly respecting the persons in question, cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies, or support the so-called 'gay culture.'\"\n\nThe instruction went on to note the difference between those who display \"deep-seated homosexual tendencies\" and those \"dealing with homosexual tendencies that were only the expression of a transitory problem.\"\n\nPope Francis upheld the ruling in 2016. In 2018 he again told Italian bishops to carefully vet candidates.\n\nLa Repubblica noted the Italian bishops during their meeting in Assisi last November approved a new Ratio Formationis Sacerdotalis, a document detailing the admission criteria and standards for men in Italy's seminaries.\n\nThe Italian paper added that the document \"has been under consideration by the Vatican Dicastery for the Clergy for final approval.\"\n\nPapal biographer Austen Ivereigh wrote on X on Tuesday that the Pope's \"concern is with gay men seeing the priesthood as a way of living out their sexuality, and the gay subculture in many seminaries.\"\n\nThe Pope has at times been hailed for his outreach to the LGBT-identified community.\n\nDuring an in-flight press conference in 2013, the Pope responded to a question from a journalist on his experience as a confessor to homosexual persons by asking rhetorically: \"Who am I to judge that person?\"\n\nThe Pope expanded on these remarks in a 2016 book-length interview titled \"The Name of God Is Mercy,\" where he said he was \"paraphrasing by heart\" the Catechism of the Church, which states that \"these people should be treated with delicacy and not be marginalized.\"\n\n\"I am glad that we are talking about 'homosexual people,'\" the Pope continued, \"because before all else comes the individual person, in his wholeness and dignity.\"\n\nIn December of last year, meanwhile, the Vatican's Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith issued Fiducia Supplicans, a declaration allowing for nonliturgical blessings for couples in \"irregular\" situations, including same-sex couples.\n\nResponding to the strong criticism the document received, Pope Francis said in February that to be \"scandalized\" by gay couple blessings is \"hypocrisy.\"\n\n\"No one is scandalized if I give a blessing to an entrepreneur who perhaps exploits people: and this is a very serious sin,\" the Pope said in the interview to the Italian weekly print periodical Credere.\n\n\"Whereas they are scandalized if I give it to a homosexual ...

He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nBruni said Francis was aware of the reports and recalled that the Argentine pope, who has made outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics a hallmark of his papacy, has long insisted there was \"room for everyone\" in the Catholic Church.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But Bruni also didn't deny that Francis used the term and acknowledged that some people were offended by it.\n\nFrancis was addressing an assembly of the Italian bishops conference, which recently approved a new document outlining training for Italian seminarians. The document, which hasn't been published pending review by the Holy See, reportedly sought to open some wiggle room in the Vatican's absolute ban on gay priests by introducing the issue of celibacy as the primary requirement for priests, gay or straight.\n\nThe Vatican ban was articulated in a 2005 document from the Congregation for Catholic Education, and later repeated in a 2016 document, which said the church cannot admit to seminaries or ordain men who \"practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called gay culture.\"\n\nThe position has long been criticized as homophobic and hypocritical for an institution that certainly counts gay priests in its ranks. The late psychotherapist Richard Sipe, a onetime Benedictine monk who taught in U.S. seminaries, estimated in the early 2000s that as many as 30% of the U.S. clergy was homosexually oriented.\n\nThe late Rev. Donald Cozzens, a seminary rector, said the percentage was even higher, and asserted in his book \"The Changing Face of The Priesthood\" that the U.S. priesthood was increasingly becoming a gay profession since so many heterosexual men left the priesthood to marry and have families.\n\nPriests in the Latin rite Catholic Church cannot marry, while those in eastern rite churches may.\n\nFrancis strongly reaffirmed the Vatican ban on gay priests in his May 20 meeting with the Italian bishops, joking that \"there is already an air of faggotness\" in seminaries, the Italian media reported, after initial reporting from gossip site Dagospia.\n\nItalian is not Francis' mother tongue language, and the Argentine pope has made linguistic gaffes in the past that raised eyebrows. The 87-year-old Argentine pope often speaks informally, jokes using slang and even curses in private.\n\nHe has been known for his outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, however, starting from his famous \"Who am I to judge \" comment in 2013 about a priest who purportedly had a gay lover in his past. He has ministered to transgender Catholics, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and called for an end to anti-gay legislation, saying in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that \"Being homosexual is not a crime.\"\n\nHowever, he has occasionally offended LGBTQ+ people and their advocates, including in that same interview where he implied that while homosexuality wasn't a crime, it was a sin. He later clarified that he was referring to sexual activity, and that any sex outside marriage between a man and a woman was sinful in the eyes of the church.\n\nAnd most recently, he signed off on a Vatican document asserting that gender-affirming surgery was a grave violation of human dignity.\n\nNew Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, welcomed Francis' apology Tuesday and said it confirmed that the \"use of the slur was a careless colloquialism.\" But the group's director Francis DeBernardo questioned the underlying content of the pope's comments and the overall ban on gays in the priesthood.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" DeBernardo said in a release, asking for a clearer statement on Francis' views about gay priests \"so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nClose\n\nAn empty pitcher and shot sized cups sit on an altar during an ayahuasca ceremony hosted by Hummingbird Church in Hildale, Utah, on Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

Nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, there is space for everyone. Just as we are, all of us',\" the statement added.\n\n- 'Harmful' language -\n\nFrancis DeBernardo, head of US LGBTQ Catholic group New Ways Ministry, welcomed the apology for what he said was a \"careless colloquialism\".\n\n\"We hope this incident will encourage him to learn more about the language he uses, and about how misuse can be dangerously harmful,\" he said.\n\nBut DeBernardo expressed disappointment that the Vatican did not clarify the pope's arguments regarding gay priests.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" he said.\n\nItalian gay rights activist Fabrizio Marrazzo, leader of the Gay Party, accused the pope of \"backsliding on LGBTQ rights\".\n\nFrancis has repeatedly insisted on the importance of a Catholic Church open to all, including LGBTQ believers, and last December opened the door to the blessing of gay couples.\n\nBut official church doctrine still states same-sex acts are \"intrinsically disordered\" and the Vatican is strongly opposed to gay marriage.\n\n- 'Messaging' -\n\nVaticanist and author John Allen said the pope was known for having a \"salty tongue\", using \"off-colour, occasionally vulgar language\".\n\nFrancis once said Catholics need not \"breed like rabbits\" and in 2015 drew criticism for seeming to defend the use of violence to defend one's faith, saying that \"if a good friend speaks badly of my mother, he can expect to get punched\".\n\nMeeting Catholic families in Verona this month, the pope told a joke about a grumpy shopkeeper, pausing half way through the punchline so it sounded like it would end with a swear word, before correcting himself with a cheeky laugh.\n\nBut Allen said the pontiff was also known for \"extraordinary political savvy\", and noted the context of his words in the seminary row.\n\n\"The Italian bishops are considering a draft set of guidelines for seminaries, the effect of which would be to say that if a guy has a same-sex orientation, that's fine, as long as he's not practising,\" Allen told AFP.\n\n\"In that context, it seems clear that the pope wanted to strike a note of caution.\"\n\nOn the streets of Rome, however, the remarks caused some dismay.\n\n\"I'm shocked. Religion is about uniting... to bring people together,\" said Caterina Constantinava, a tourist visiting from London.\n\nHer daughter, Alexandria, 14, added: \"As a person who has such high power, he doesn't need to go around using foul language... it's just disrespectful.\"\n\nar/gv\n\nMore from this section\n\nClosing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

to admitting gay people into the priesthood.\n\nItalian political gossip website Dagospia was the first to report on the alleged incident, said to have happened on May 20 when the pontiff met Italian bishops behind closed doors.\n\nOne daily, Corriere della Sera, quoted unnamed bishops who were in the room as suggesting that the pope, as an Argentine, might have not realised that the Italian term he used was offensive.\n\nBruni said Francis was \"aware\" of the various articles.\n\nThe Vatican spokesman reiterated that the pope remained committed to a welcoming Church for all, where \"nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, (where) there is room for everyone\".\n\nHis reported comments caused shock and consternation, even among his supporters.\n\nVito Mancuso, an Italian theologian and former priest, told daily La Stampa that Francis' language was \"despicable and surprising because it blatantly jars\" with his previous messages on LGBT issues.\n\nFrancis, who is 87, has been credited with making substantial overtures towards the LGBT community during his 11-year papacy.\n\nIn 2013, at the start of his papacy, he famously said, \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\" Last year he allowed priests to bless members of same-sex couples, triggering a substantial conservative backlash.\n\nBack in 2018, Francis admitted making \"grave mistakes\" in the handling of a sexual abuse crisis in Chile, where he initially dismissed as slander accusations against a bishop suspected of protecting a predator priest.\n\n\"I apologise to all those I have offended and I hope to be able to do it personally in the coming weeks, in the meetings I will have (with victims),\" he wrote in a letter to Chilean bishops.", "source": {"uri":

Italian news outlet Dagospia was first to report the alleged comments made by the pope, per BBC and The Guardian.\n\nPope Francis reportedly shared his objection against gay men being admitted to Catholic Seminaries after being asked at the meeting. Per the outlets, he then allegedly said the word \"frociaggine\" in Italian -- which translates as a derogatory term for gay people -- as he claimed there were too many members of the community entering seminaries.\n\nItalian news outlets La Repubblica, Corriere della Sera and Adnkronos all cited sources confirming the pope used the term, leaving attendees shocked and confused, per The Guardian.\n\nPope Francis also allegedly said during the meeting that should gay people be allowed to train for the priesthood they are at risk of leading a double life, per The Times.\n\nIn response to the reports, Director of the Holy See Press Office, Matteo Bruni, told PEOPLE, \"Pope Francis is aware of the articles that have recently been published about a conversation held behind closed doors, with members of the Italian Bishops' Conference.

That cannot be done because that is not the sacrament. I cannot. The Lord made it that way,\" the pope clarified during the interview. \"But to bless each person, yes. The blessing is for everyone. For everyone.\"\n\n\"To bless a homosexual-type union, however, goes against the given right, the law of the Church. But to bless each person, why not?\" he added. \"The blessing is for all. Some people were scandalized by this. But why? Everyone! Everyone!\"\n\nThe interview followed the Vatican's doctrine office release of a document giving Catholic priests permission to bless same-sex couples in December 2023, which was praised as a \"major step forward\" at the time.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nIn his initial response to questions on the subject two months earlier, the pope said, \"God never turns away anyone who approaches him! Ultimately, a blessing offers people a means to increase their trust in God. ... It is a seed of the Holy Spirit that must be nurtured, not hindered.\"\n\nThe pontiff first declared his support for the civil unions of same-sex couples in October 2020, following comments he made in the documentary Francesco.

Nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, there is space for everyone. Just as we are, all of us',\" the statement added.\n\n- 'Harmful' language -\n\nFrancis DeBernardo, head of US LGBTQ Catholic group New Ways Ministry, welcomed the apology for what he said was a \"careless colloquialism\".\n\n\"We hope this incident will encourage him to learn more about the language he uses, and about how misuse can be dangerously harmful,\" he said.\n\nBut DeBernardo expressed disappointment that the Vatican did not clarify the pope's arguments regarding gay priests.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" he said.\n\nItalian gay rights activist Fabrizio Marrazzo, leader of the Gay Party, accused the pope of \"backsliding on LGBTQ rights\".\n\nFrancis has repeatedly insisted on the importance of a Catholic Church open to all, including LGBTQ believers, and last December opened the door to the blessing of gay couples.\n\nBut official church doctrine still states same-sex acts are \"intrinsically disordered\" and the Vatican is strongly opposed to gay marriage.\n\n- 'Messaging' -\n\nVaticanist and author John Allen said the pope was known for having a \"salty tongue\", using \"off-colour, occasionally vulgar language\".\n\nFrancis once said Catholics need not \"breed like rabbits\" and in 2015 drew criticism for seeming to defend the use of violence to defend one's faith, saying that \"if a good friend speaks badly of my mother, he can expect to get punched\".\n\nMeeting Catholic families in Verona this month, the pope told a joke about a grumpy shopkeeper, pausing half way through the punchline so it sounded like it would end with a swear word, before correcting himself with a cheeky laugh.\n\nBut Allen said the pontiff was also known for \"extraordinary political savvy\", and noted the context of his words in the seminary row.\n\n\"The Italian bishops are considering a draft set of guidelines for seminaries, the effect of which would be to say that if a guy has a same-sex orientation, that's fine, as long as he's not practising,\" Allen told AFP.\n\n\"In that context, it seems clear that the pope wanted to strike a note of caution.\"\n\nOn the streets of Rome, however, the remarks caused some dismay.\n\n\"I'm shocked. Religion is about uniting... to bring people together,\" said Caterina Constantinava, a tourist visiting from London.\n\nHer daughter, Alexandria, 14, added: \"As a person who has such high power, he doesn't need to go around using foul language... it's just disrespectful.\"\n\nar/gv", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There is today's culture of homosexuality with respect to those who have a homosexual orientation [who] are better off not being accepted [into the seminary].'\n\nThe remark was met with 'incredulous laughter', bishops told newspaper Corriere della Sera, but represents a huge step back for campaigners after prolonged efforts to reform the church's position on LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nThe Pope has not posted on Twitter/X since yesterday and news channel Vatican News remains unchanged since Monday, the most recent post quoting the Pope in urging collaboration with Buddhist monks 'for a more inclusive world'.\n\nPope Francis is pictured during a meeting with the Italian Bishops' Conference at the Vatican\n\nThe comments were allegedly made in a closed-door meeting ahead of the conference. Pictured: The opening session of the 79th general assembly of the Italian Bishops Conference\n\nPope Francis attends a Mass in St .Peter's Square for the first World Children's Day on May 26\n\nItalian media has quoted the Pope as having said: 'Look, there is already an air of f*****ness going around that isn't good. There is a culture today of homosexuality, because of which those with a homosexual orientation are better off not being welcomed [into the seminary].\n\n'It is very difficult for a boy who has this tendency not to fall [into sin] because they come [to the seminary] thinking that the life of the priest can support them, but then they fall during the work of the ministry.'\n\nSome suggested the comments were an honest translation mistake for the Pope, for whom Italian is a second language, and that he 'did not know' how offensive the word was.\n\nBut the allegations could spell a significant step back for the church after years spent shifting its position on LGBTQ+ matters.\n\nWhen asked about his views on homosexuality in 2013, he famously said: 'If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?'\n\nLast year, he described laws that criminalise homosexuality as a 'sin' and an 'injustice', and allowed Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples in a significant advance for LGBT rights in the church.\n\nHowever, the Pope delivered a similar message on gay seminarians - minus the reported swear word - when he met Italian bishops in 2018, telling them to carefully vet priesthood applicants and reject anyone suspected of being homosexual.\n\nPolitical gossip website Dagospia was the first to report on the alleged incident, said to have happened on May 20, when the Italian Bishops Conference opened a four-day assembly with a non-public meeting with the pontiff.\n\nBorn in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Francis's native language is Spanish, and though he is fluent in Italian he has made a number of linguistic faux pas in the past.\n\nHe has previously said that if a boy is unsure about his sexuality and is facing mental health challenges he might need 'psychiatric' support.\n\nIt widely believed he instead meant 'psychological' help, words he has also confused on other occasions.\n\nFrancesco Lepore, a former priest who is now a gay rights activist, said he was 'stunned' by the comments allegedly made by Francis, who is also known by his birth name Jorge Mario Bergoglio.\n\n'Despite being accustomed by now to the type of direct language on the part of Bergoglio, speaking of 'f*****ry' in the seminaries seems more like a bar and a tavern than a Pontiff,' he told la Repubblica.\n\n'This expression would never have appeared on the lips of Paul VI, John Paul II or Benedict XVI, who also took damning positions towards homosexuality.\n\nHe added: 'The Pope is right that the number of homosexual seminarians and clerics is very high. But the simplicity of language has nothing to do with vulgarity.'\n\nReports about the pontiff's remarks at the meeting come after bishops approved a document regulating admission to Italian seminaries, according to Corriere.\n\nBorn in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Francis' first language is Spanish, and though he is fluent in Italian he has made a number of linguistic faux pas in the past\n\nThe paper reported that members 'approved by majority vote an amendment that recognized the distinction between simple homosexual orientation and 'deeply rooted tendencies.'\n\nThis, it suggests, means 'in substance, that a homosexual person could be admitted to the seminary if, like the heterosexual, he gave the guarantee that he knows how to live the discipline of celibacy.'\n\nHowever, it reportedly implies 'that it is more difficult for homosexuals because they will be living in an all-male community for many years.'\n\nFrancis's latest remarks seemingly suggest he is taking 'a more radical' view on the issue, by preventing gay men from being allowed to join altogether.\n\nThe Holy See has not approved the document, according to reports, and the issue is still under discussion.\n\nThe 2005 Vatican document, released under Pope Benedict XVI and endorsed by Francis in 2016, states that the Church 'cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called 'gay culture.''\n\nThere is so far no official record of the Pope's latest comments on the issue and the Vatican has not commented.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary",

Nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, there is space for everyone. Just as we are, all of us',\" the statement added.\n\n- 'Harmful' language -\n\nFrancis DeBernardo, head of US LGBTQ Catholic group New Ways Ministry, welcomed the apology for what he said was a \"careless colloquialism\".\n\n\"We hope this incident will encourage him to learn more about the language he uses, and about how misuse can be dangerously harmful,\" he said.\n\nBut DeBernardo expressed disappointment that the Vatican did not clarify the pope's arguments regarding gay priests.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" he said.\n\nMore from this section Nations Fail to Agree on Treaty on Preventing Next Pandemic Modi's 'Mujra For Vote Bank' Attack On INDIA Bloc; Kejriwal Schools Pak Neta 2024 Lok Sabha Polls Hicksville veteran awarded Purple Heart posthumously\n\nItalian gay rights activist Fabrizio Marrazzo, leader of the Gay Party, accused the pope of \"backsliding on LGBTQ rights\".\n\nFrancis has repeatedly insisted on the importance of a Catholic Church open to all, including LGBTQ believers, and last December opened the door to the blessing of gay couples.\n\nBut official church doctrine still states same-sex acts are \"intrinsically disordered\" and the Vatican is strongly opposed to gay marriage.\n\n- 'Messaging' -\n\nVaticanist and author John Allen said the pope was known for having a \"salty tongue\", using \"off-colour, occasionally vulgar language\".\n\nFrancis once said Catholics need not \"breed like rabbits\" and in 2015 drew criticism for seeming to defend the use of violence to defend one's faith, saying that \"if a good friend speaks badly of my mother, he can expect to get punched\".\n\nMeeting Catholic families in Verona this month, the pope told a joke about a grumpy shopkeeper, pausing half way through the punchline so it sounded like it would end with a swear word, before correcting himself with a cheeky laugh.\n\nBut Allen said the pontiff was also known for \"extraordinary political savvy\", and noted the context of his words in the seminary row.\n\n\"The Italian bishops are considering a draft set of guidelines for seminaries, the effect of which would be to say that if a guy has a same-sex orientation, that's fine, as long as he's not practising,\" Allen told AFP.\n\n\"In that context, it seems clear that the pope wanted to strike a note of caution.\"\n\nOn the streets of Rome, however, the remarks caused some dismay.\n\n\"I'm shocked. Religion is about uniting... to bring people together,\" said Caterina Constantinava, a tourist visiting from London.\n\nHer daughter, Alexandria, 14, added: \"As a person who has such high power, he

They suggested that it was an honest mistake by the Pope, for whom Italian is a second language, and that he did not know how offensive the word was.\n\nThe alleged comments, which seem to go against recent moves to amend seminary admission rules, have come as a surprise to some in the church as Francis is known for taking a more liberal view than his predecessors on LGBT rights.\n\nBorn in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Francis' first language is Spanish, and though he is fluent in Italian he has made a number of linguistic faux pas in the past\n\nWhen asked about his views on homosexuality in 2013, he famously said: 'If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?'\n\nLast year, he described laws that criminalise homosexuality as a 'sin' and an 'injustice', and allowed Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples in a significant advance for LGBT rights in the church.\n\nThe reports about the closed-door meeting on May 20 come after bishops approved a document regulating admission to Italian seminaries, according to Corriere.\n\nThe paper reported that members 'approved by majority vote an amendment that recognized the distinction between simple homosexual orientation and 'deeply rooted tendencies.'\n\nThis, it suggests, means 'in substance, that a homosexual person could be admitted to the seminary if, like the heterosexual, he gave the guarantee that he knows how to live the discipline of celibacy.'\n\nHowever, it reportedly implies 'that it is more difficult for homosexuals because they will be living in an all-male community for many years.'\n\nFrancis' latest remarks suggest he is taking 'a more radical' view on the issue, by preventing gay men from being allowed to join altogether.\n\nThe Holy See has not approved the document, according to reports, and the issue is still under discussion.\n\nThe comments were allegedly made in a closed-door meeting ahead of the conference. Pictured: The opening session of the 79th general assembly of the Italian Bishops Conference\n\nThe 2005 Vatican document, which was endorsed by Francis in 2016, states that the Church 'cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called \"gay culture.\"'\n\nThere is so far no official record of the Pope's latest comments on the issue.\n\nBorn in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Francis' first language is Spanish, and though he is fluent in Italian he has made a number of linguistic faux pas in the past.\n\nHe has previously said that if a boy is unsure about his sexuality and is facing mental health challenges he might need 'psychiatric' support.\n\nIt widely believed he instead meant

While discussing the admission of homosexual men into seminaries, the Pontiff said that seminaries are already full of \"frociaggine,\" which roughly translates to \"f****try\" in English, according to several Italian media reports. Shocked bishops told the newspaper Corriere della Sera that the Sovereign of Vatican City State's derogatory remarks were met with \"incredulous laughter.\"\n\nCiting sources, Italian news agency Adnkronos reported that the 87-year-old said during the discussion, \"Look: there is already an air of f****try around that is not good. There is today's culture of homosexuality with respect to those who have a homosexual orientation [who] are better off not being accepted [into the seminary].\"\n\nAs the head of the Catholic Church is known to have a more liberal approach, his remark came as a surprise. Francis' alleged use of the slur was first reported by the political gossip website Dagospia, where the incident was said to have occurred on May 20 during a four-day assembly with a non-public meeting with the pope.\n\nWhile the alleged comments seem to be in opposition to the recent moves to amend seminary admission rules, some bishops suggested that the pope may not have been aware of the derogatory term's meaning. In a striking contrast to his predecessor, he previously approved a ruling that allowed priests to bless unmarried and same-sex couples, per The Guardian.\n\nFrancis, who was elected as the pope in 2013, famously said at the time, \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\" when asked about his views on homosexuality.

It's forged in part by the Vatican's own official communications channels, but even more so by outside commentators and media platforms heavily invested in selling a given pope's story to the world.\n\nThroughout his papacy, John Paul II enjoyed a wide network of friendly commentators and analysts, forever prepared to interpret the Pope in the best possible light. Benedict XVI had his own support system, though smaller and quieter by comparison.\n\nThe fact that Francis has such a coterie - not the same people, obviously, but doing much the same thing - has been made abundantly clear in the last 24 hours or so, vis-\u00e0-vis news reports that he used a crude slang term in referring to homosexuals during a session with Italian bishops on 20 May.\n\nIronically, it's possible that in this case, the Pope's mediatic Praetorian Guard actually may be misrepresenting the pontiff in order to protect him, but more on that in a moment.\n\nOn 20 May, Pope Francis was in the Vatican's synod hall in order to address the spring plenary assembly of the Italian Episcopal Conference (known by the acronym CEI). There were roughly 230 bishops in the room, along with other clergy and supporting staff, meaning this wasn't just a casual chat among a handful of friends.\n\nTechnically, Francis's remarks to CEI are considered private, meaning the Vatican doesn't release an official transcript. Yet with that many people in the room - some of whom have particularly cozy relationships with reporters - it's generally foreordained that whatever the Pope says will get out. Certainly, the media-savvy Francis would have understood that whatever he said in that space was unlikely to stay there.\n\nOne of the topics that arose was the question of the admission of homosexual men to Catholic seminaries. Soon afterwards, rumours began to circulate that Francis had used an off-colour term in the context of the discussion, saying there's already too much frociaggine in seminaries, which translates roughly to \"faggotry\".\n\nThe root term in Italian is frocio, the most widely used pejorative term in Italian for a gay man, the etymology of which has been lost in time. (One theory traces it back to the 1527 sack of Rome, when feroci, or \"ferocious\", invading troops supposedly raped men and women indistinctly, but nobody really knows.) The suffix -aggine denotes a quality or characteristic; for instance, Italians take the word stupido (which means what you think) and turn it into stupidaggini to convey acts of stupidity, i.e., \"nonsense\".\n\nThe rumour that Francis used the word frociaggine was first made public by the Italian blog Dagospia, which is more or less the country's equivalent of the Drudge Report, and was then picked up by mainstream media, first in Italy and then around the world.\n\nIn presenting the news, a striking share of media outlets have done so in ways seemingly intended to let the Pope off the hook, in terms of the charge of being offensive, noting high up in their coverage that Italian is not his mother tongue and suggesting he may not have understood that the term in question is offensive.\n\nOne prominent Italian newspaper, for example, pointed out that growing up in Argentina, the future pope spoke the Piedmont dialect rather than today's standard Italian, and the paper quoted unnamed bishops present at the time who said \"it was obvious Francis was not aware of how much in our language the word is weighty and offensive\".\n\nMany media outlets also suggested the Pope must not have known what he was saying, given his reputation as the pope of \"Who am I to judge?\" fame. Francis has built a reputation for being LGBT friendly, so the coverage holds, meaning that he must have used the term almost accidentally, without intending to shock or offend.\n\nWhat should be made of these interpretations?\n\nTo begin, it's true there may be a generational discount to be applied. Francis, after all, is 87, and at times may use outdated expressions in ways that if someone younger were to say it, the effect would be different. My grandad had a heart of gold, but could sometimes use racial vocabulary that would make anybody cringe.\n\nAt the same time, throughout his career Francis has been known occasionally to indulge in off-colour expressions of all sorts. Some find that aspect of his personality crude or off-putting, others see his capacity to employ the argot of the street as part of his pastoral charm: carrying the \"smell of his sheep\", as it were. In any event, it's a trait that doesn't necessarily always reflect the Pope's developed thinking, but rather something more akin to shooting from the hip.\n\nAnd, yet.\n\nI didn't grow up in an ethnically Italian home like Francis, I haven't spoken Italian all my life, and the primary language in which I work every day isn't Italian either. When Francis speaks Italian, he sounds like a native; when I do, I come off as an immigrant in Italy with a comically thick American accent.\n\nYet, even I know that the word frocio and its variants are strong medicine, and definitely not something you say in mixed company.\n\nI recall distinctly in my first Italian class here in Rome a quarter-century ago that we had a gay teacher, and, at one point, a teenager in the class called him frocio - the response was immediate and unmistakable, with at least a half-dozen people shouting at the teenager to put a sock in it.\n\nThe bottom line is that it strains credulity, to put it mildly, that Pope Francis simply didn't understand the language he was using. Moreover, it's striking that many of the same people now urging us to believe in the Pope's na\u00efvet\u00e9 more typically are the ones extolling his savvy, deeply in-touch command of the moment.\n\nGiven all that, there's another interpretation of his statement to the Italian bishops, which is that he meant what he said: In his view, there's an overly strong element of what is sometimes referred to as a worryingly \"gay lifestyle\" in at least some seminary environments, and which warrants caution in terms of admitting gay candidates.\n\nAt the moment, CEI is considering a new set of admissions guidelines, a draft of which distinguishes between orientation and behaviour in the evaluation of gay candidates. Perhaps Francis deliberately wanted to trigger a yellow light; an invitation to slow down and be careful about inadvertently encouraging unhealthy elements in seminary life.\n\nPhoto: Pope Francis greets Italian bishops, 20 May 2024.

The pontiff was in the midst of arguing that gay people should be barred from becoming priests.\n\nLa Repubblica credited its article to unspecified sources after a political gossip site first reported the allegations, while Corriere said unnamed bishops confirmed the incident, Reuters wrote. But some of the clergymen said the pope was speaking Italian, a second language, and might not have realized the term was insensitive.\n\nThe pontiff allegedly said the homophobic word in a private May 20 meeting with Italian bishops, potentially denting his reputation for relative tolerance toward gay people.\n\nIn December the pope formally approved allowing Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples in an effort to broaden inclusivity.

In light of recent allegations, the user commented on the video, writing: \"This happened just over a year ago, but times are changing and certainly not for the better!\"\n\nPrior to this news, many believed that Pope Francis was laying the groundwork to ultimately allow gay men to train for the priesthood, so long as they took a vow of celibacy, just as all other priests do.\n\nHowever, at last week's conference, he shot down the idea, allegedly claiming that gay men ran the risk of being unable to renounce their homosexuality and leading a double-life.\n\nThe Vatican has been called on for a response to the recent allegations, but has yet to make a statement regarding their validity.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priesthood_in_the_Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Priesthood in the Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godparent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Godparent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baptism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerical_celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clerical celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Computers_and_Internet", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Computers and Internet", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/gcn_uk_889/9b86e3ad2b90c5e5f3aa3183fabbbfd5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 145, "textEnd": 151}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

The closed-door meeting took place in Rome last week, but was first reported on Monday by Italian tabloid news website Dasgopia.\n\nIt has since been reported by other outlets, including authoritative Italian dailies La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera and the news agency Adnkronos, which quoted their own unnamed sources among bishops present at the meeting.\n\nThe Vatican has not yet commented on the reports, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Independent.\n\nOne person privy to the incident suggested Francis meant it as a \"joke\", saying those around him were surprised and perplexed by the alleged remarks. Corriere della Sera quoted sources saying that those present felt the Pope, whose first language is Spanish, did not realise how offensive the word was.\n\nAccording to Italian media, during a meeting in November the bishops had decided that gay men could be included in seminaries if they practised celibacy.\n\nBut the move was ultimately stopped by Pope Francis, who has been widely praised throughout his time in the Vatican for taking an inclusive tone towards the queer community.\n\nEarlier in December, the Vatican released a document in which Francis formally approved allowing priests to bless same-sex couples, stipulating that people seeking God's love and mercy shouldn't be subject to \"an exhaustive moral analysis\" to receive it.\n\nThe document elaborated on a letter Francis sent to two conservative cardinals that was published in October. In that preliminary response, Francis suggested such blessings could be offered under some circumstances if they didn't confuse the ritual with the sacrament of marriage.\n\nIn January 2023, Francis assailed the laws on the books in many countries that criminalise homosexuality and called for their elimination. \"Being homosexual isn't a crime,\" Francis said during an interview with the Associated Press.\n\nAnother reversal came in late 2023, when the Vatican made public a statement saying it was permissible, under certain circumstances, for transgender people to be baptised as Catholics and serve as godparents.\n\nThe document was signed by Francis and Cardinal V\u00edctor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez, who heads the Vatican's Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith.\n\nIf it did not cause scandal or \"disorientation\" among other Catholics, a transgender person \"may receive baptism under the same conditions as other faithful,\" the document said.\n\nSimilarly, the document said trans adults - even if they had undergone gender-transition surgery - could serve as godfathers or godmothers under certain conditions.\n\nThe new pronouncement reversed the absolute bans on trans people serving as godparents issued by the Vatican doctrine office in 2015.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "namita_singh@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Namita Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corriere della Sera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priesthood_in_the_Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Priesthood in the Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sodomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Repubblica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Repubblica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnkronos", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adnkronos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicastery_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00edctor_Manuel_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "V\u00edctor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godparent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Godparent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian views on marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/d88a08f67854ee9c791a1c84033d8e9c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

DeBernardo said he was disappointed that the pontiff did not explain what was meant by the remark.\n\n\"Without a clarification, his words will be interpreted as a blanket ban on accepting any gay man to a seminary,\" he said.\n\nDeBernardo demanded Francis \"provide a clearer statement on his views about gay priests, so many of whom faithfully serve the people of God each day.\"\n\nThe Post said that some on the left believed the comment was leaked as part of the battle over the role of homosexuals in the church.\n\nThe Global Network of Rainbow Catholics said it was part of an effort to sabotage the pope's LGBT outreach efforts.\n\n\"There is definitely mischief afoot to try and undermine Pope Francis,\" the group said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com",

The comments reportedly made on May 20th, caused a stir within the Catholic community and raised concerns about the Pope's stance on LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nAccording to Italian newspapers Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica, sources from inside the meeting claimed that the Pope used the term \"frociaggine,\" which translates to \"f*gg*try\" in English, to describe certain seminaries. These reports sparked widespread criticism and disappointment among those who believe in promoting inclusivity and acceptance.\n\nHowever, in response to the controversy, the Vatican released a statement on behalf of Pope Francis, expressing his regret and apologizing for any offense caused. The statement read, \"The Pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term, as reported by others,\" the Vatican said in a statement. \"As he (Pope Francis) has said on several occasions, 'in the Church, there is room for everyone, everyone! No one is useless, no one is superfluous, there is room for everyone. Just as we are, everyone.'\"\n\nThe Director of the Holy See Press Office, Matteo Bruni, also made that statement this Tuesday in response to questions from journalists about the use of a term:\n\n\"Pope Francis is aware of the recent articles regarding a closed-door conversation with the bishops of the CEI [Italian Bishops' Conference]. As he has stated on many occasions, 'There is room for everyone in the Church, for everyone! No one is useless; no one is superfluous; there is room for everyone. Just as we are, everyone.' The Pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he apologizes to those who felt offended by the use of a term, as reported by others,\" Vatican News quotes.\n\nRELATED:Breaking: Pope Francis Says Priests Can Bless Same-Sex Couples\n\nRELATED:Vatican Takes Progressive Step In Allowing Transgender Catholics To Be Baptized And Become Godparents As Pope Francis Continues To Support LGBTQ After Initial Criticism\n\nPope Francis has consistently emphasized the need for a welcoming and inclusive Church.\n\nJust last year, he also reaffirmed that homosexuality is not a crime and that any sexual act outside of marriage is a sin, in a written response to a request for clarification about his past remarks during a recent interview with the Associated Press.\n\n\"We are all children of God, and God loves us as we are and for the strength that each of us fights for our dignity. Being homosexual is not a crime. It is not a crime.\"\n\nHe went on to clarify, \"When I said it is a sin, I was simply referring to Catholic moral teaching, which says that every sexual act outside of marriage is a sin.

I should have said, 'It is a sin, as is any sexual act outside of marriage,'\" he wrote. \"This is to speak of 'the matter' of sin, but we know well that Catholic morality not only takes into consideration the matter but also evaluates freedom and intention; and this, for every kind of sin.

Nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, there is space for everyone. Just as we are, all of us',\" the statement said.\n\nFrancis, a former archbishop of Buenos Aires who relishes being among his flock and cultivates an image of a down-to-earth leader, has a history of speaking bluntly.\n\nOff-the-cuff remarks include saying Catholics need not \"breed like rabbits\". He also seemingly defended the use of violence to defend one's faith, saying in 2015 that \"if a good friend speaks badly of my mother, he can expect to get punched\".\n\nAt a meeting with Catholic families in Verona this month, Francis told a joke about a grumpy shopkeeper, pausing halfway through the punchline so it sounded like it would end with a swear word, before correcting himself with a cheeky laugh.\n\n'Harmful' language\n\nBut Francis DeBernardo, head of US LGBTQ Catholic group New Ways Ministry, had told AFP ahead of the Vatican statement that he would welcome an apology from the pope.\n\n\"Pope Francis has not always been clear in his remarks about LGBTQ+ people,\" he said.\n\n\"We hope this incident will encourage him to learn more about the language he uses, and about how misuse can be dangerously harmful.\"\n\nIn Rome on Tuesday, some visitors also expressed dismay at the words used by such an important spiritual leader.\n\n\"I'm shocked. Religion is about uniting... to bring people together,\" said Caterina Constantinava, a tourist visiting from London.\n\nHer daughter, Alexandria, 14, added: \"As a person who has such high power, he doesn't need to go around using foul language.\n\n\"He can just simply say 'I disagree with this', he doesn't need to use such language, it's just disrespectful,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pontiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Buenos_Aires", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Buenos Aires"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Ways_Ministry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Ways Ministry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Verona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alexandria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Linguistics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Style_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Style Guides", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Language", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Language", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://s.france24.com/media/display/39133832-1cff-11ef-b0de-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/3a3105e634c6ccc29220f9dc09fd5a92298e17bf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Francis is reported to have used extremely derogatory language in an incident that could have a profound impact on the way his attitude towards gay people is perceived.\n\nWhen asked at the Italian

saying in Italian that in the church there was already too much of an air of frociaggine, which translates as a highly offensive slur.\n\nAlthough it was a meeting that happened behind closed doors, the pope's reported comments were first conveyed to the Italian tabloid website Dagospia.\n\nOther Italian news agencies have since confirmed the pope's words, citing numerous sources.\n\nThere has been shock at the pope's reported language, particularly as he has often talked publicly of being respectful towards gay people.\n\nProgressive supporters of the pope have long argued that while little has tangibly changed in terms of gay rights in Catholicism, pope Francis has changed the tone of the church's attitude.\n\nWhen asked about gay people early in his papacy, he hit the headlines by responding, \"Who am I to judge?\"\n\nHe recently created consternation among Catholic traditionalists by saying priests should be able to bless same-sex couples in some circumstances and has frequently talked of gay people being welcome in the church.\n\nSome had started to feel he was laying the groundwork to ultimately permit gay men to train for the priesthood, as long as they remained celibate like other priests.\n\nHe not only shot that down in no uncertain terms at the conference, but some news agencies reported that he used derogatory language on more than one occasion.\n\nThe Spanish-speaking pope's defenders point out that he does sometimes make mistakes in Italian colloquialisms, and suggest he did not appreciate the level of offence he might have caused, even though he did grow up in an Italian-speaking household in Argentina.\n\nSome outlets report that the pope also said gay people needed to be kicked out of seminaries, whether they acted on their sexual

Is the Pope Catholic?!?\n\nYou could pose another, more pertinent, question of the Catholic church, however. Is the current pontiff Francis living up to claims - or perhaps hopes - that his reign would usher in an era of less hostility to gays. The answer to this is probably \"no\".\n\nThe evidence was writ large in Italian newspapers reports that Francis has complained \"there's already too much faggotry\" among trainee priests.\n\nThe comments, made during a meeting in Rome with Italian bishops on 20 May, to discuss the subject of gay priests, were reported by La Repubblica's correspondent, and subsequently confirmed by several other people present at the meeting.\n\nThe Holy See said in a statement on Tuesday: \"The Pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he apologises to those who felt offended by the use of a term reported by others,\" adding: \"As [Pope Francis] stated on several occasions, 'In the Church there is room for everyone... Just as we are, all of us.'\"\n\nFamously in 2013, the Argentinian pontiff sounded a more tolerant note on sexuality after he replaced the ultra-conservative Pope Ratsinger. Francis declared: \"If they [gay priests] accept the Lord and have goodwill, who am I to judge them? They shouldn't be marginalised. The tendency [same-sex attraction] is not the problem... they're our brothers.\"\n\nBut reacting the Pope's latest comments, veteran Vatican watcher Robert Mickens, editor-in-chief of the progressive Catholic La Croix International website says: \"This shows that despite the noises about greater inclusiveness in recent years, nothing has really changed.\"\n\nThe offensive word Francis used - \"frociaggine\" - is the kind of crude term (based on the slur \"frocio\" or \"faggot\"), typical of the local Roman slang.\n\nSeveral bishops present at the meeting have suggested that the Pope, who grew up in an Italian-speaking household, didn't understand its offensiveness. So too, have some of the unduly deferential correspondents who exist with them in the Vatican bubble. Some others suggest it is simply more evidence of 87-year-old Francis getting ever more irascible in his old age.\n\nThese look like feeble excuses. \"Anyway, several people have told me he [Francis] uses the Spanish equivalent \"keke\" the whole time,\" says Mickens.\n\nDespite the earlier noises Francis made about the Church being more welcoming of the LGBT community, he remains at heart a conservative Catholic bishop, who grew up in the macho culture of Argentina.\n\nAnd his distaste for non-nuclear families has always been evident.\n\nIn 2015 he declared: \"The family is threatened by growing efforts on the part of some to redefine the very institution of marriage, by relativism, by the culture of the ephemeral, by a lack of openness to life.\" This statement appeared to denigrate at a stroke the value of families with LGBTQ+ parents and those with unmarried heterosexual parents.\n\nFrancis' problems with non-traditional families will receive a sympathetic hearing in the far-right government of Italian premier Giorgia Meloni, who describes herself as a Christian mother and has tried to prevent gays having families by banning surrogacy.\n\nMeloni thinks a child should only be raised by a mother and a father.\n\nGays, the unmarried and single women aren't alone in being described by the leader of the world's Catholics in terms you might have heard in 70s working man's club.\n\nVatican insiders say the Pope is not averse to \"mother-in-law\" jokes and often refers to the practice of abortion, another taboo - like homosexuality - in the eyes of the Holy See, as \"hiring a hitman\".\n\nOn the gay issue, the Vatican will probably be hoping the current row blows over. Then it will adopt its tried-and-tested strategy of don't ask; don't tell. Hypocrisy, to you and me.\n\nIn November, in Assisi, the Italian Bishops Conference (CEI) approved a text on admission for seminaries, \"Ratio formationis sacerdotalis, which is awaiting approval from the Holy See. In essence, it says the problem is not \"gay tendencies\" but a willingness to \"act them out\".\n\nThere will always be gays in the seminary - as one insider told me today: \"If they didn't have gay men in the seminary, there wouldn't be that many left.\"\n\nBut it seems, they will never really have the love or respect of the man in charge.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

He has also made overtures on women's rights but has stopped short of moving to allow women to be ordained.\n\nStill, Monday's media storm highlighted how far the Church is from allowing a more tolerant approach to become its actual doctrine, and how deeply complex the Vatican's attitude toward LGBTQ people is.\n\nIn one recent example, the pontiff signaled groundbreaking openness by saying priests should be able to bless same-sex couples in certain instances, some of the Vatican's most progressive remarks to date.\n\nBut the overture led to a fierce backlash, with the Holy See clarifying that any such move would not formally contradict traditional doctrine on same-sex marriage, which the Church fiercely opposes despite growing acceptance from members.\n\nWith a dwindling number of priests, the question of whether seminaries should openly admit homosexual men is not new, and the Pope reportedly said in 2018 that \"the slightest doubt\" about a seminarian being gay would suffice to block his admission.\n\nFrancis is no stranger to controversy. Earlier this year he appeared to suggest that Kyiv should surrender after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and that it should seek to negotiate peace with Moscow. He was quick to clarify his remarks, noting that he condemns all wars.\n\n--With assistance from Tiago Ramos Alfaro and Antonio Vanuzzo.\n\nYou are on Mint!

{"uri": "2024-05-370490914", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-05-28", "time": "07:29:44", "dateTime": "2024-05-28T07:29:44Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-05-28T07:29:35Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "url": "https://cruxnow.com/news-analysis/2024/05/is-popes-pr-safety-net-misrepresenting-his-use-of-slang/", "title": "Is Pope's PR safety net misrepresenting his use of slang?", "body": "ROME - One curious feature of the modern papacy is the informal, but very real, PR safety net which grows up almost spontaneously around every pontiff. It's forged in part by the Vatican's own official communications channels, but even more so by outside commentators and media platforms heavily invested in selling a given pope's story to the world.\n\nThroughout his papacy, John Paul II enjoyed a wide network of friendly commentators and analysts, forever prepared to interpret the pope in the best possible light. Benedict XVI had his own support system, though smaller and quieter by comparison.\n\nThe fact that Francis has such a coterie - not the same people, obviously, but doing much the same thing - has been made abundantly clear in the last 24 hours or so, vis-\u00e0-vis news reports that he used a crude slang term in referring to homosexuals in a May 20 session with Italian bishops.\n\nIronically, it's possible that in this case, the pope's mediatic Praetorian Guard actually may be misrepresenting the pontiff in order to save him, but more on that in a moment.\n\nTo set the scene, on May 20 Pope Francis was in the Vatican's synod hall in order to address the spring plenary assembly of the Italian Episcopal Conference (known by the acronym CEI). There were roughly 230 bishops in the room, along with other clergy and supporting staff, meaning this wasn't just a casual chat among a handful of friends.\n\nTechnically, Francis's remarks to CEI are considered private, meaning the Vatican doesn't release an official transcript. Yet with that many people in the room - some of whom, by the way, have awfully cozy relationships with reporters - it's generally foreordained that whatever the pope says will get out. Certainly, the media-savvy Francis would have understood that whatever he said in that space was unlikely to stay there.\n\nOne of the topics that arose was the question of the admission of homosexual men to Catholic seminaries. Soon afterwards, rumors began to circulate that Francis had used an off-color term in the context of the discussion, saying there's already too much frociaggine in seminaries, which translates roughly to \"faggotry.\"\n\nThe root term in Italian is frocio, the most widely used pejorative term in Italian for a gay man, the etymology of which has been lost in time. (One theory traces it back to the 1527 sack of Rome, when feroci, or \"ferocious\", invading troops supposedly raped men and women indistinctly, but nobody really knows.) The suffix -aggine denotes a quality or characteristic; for instance, Italians take the word stupido (which means what you think) and turn it into stupidaggini to convey acts of stupidity, i.e., \"nonsense.\"\n\nThe rumor that Francis used the word was first made public by the Italian blog Dagospia, which is more or less the country's equivalent of the Drudge Report, and then picked up by mainstream media, first in Italy and then around the world.\n\nIn presenting the news, a striking share of media outlets have done so in ways seemingly intended to take the pope off the hook, noting high up in their coverage that Italian is not his mother tongue and suggesting he may not have understood that the term in question is offensive.\n\nOne prominent Italian newspaper, for example, pointed out that growing up in Argentina, the future pope spoke the Piedmont dialect rather than today's standard Italian, and quoted unnamed bishops present at the time who said \"it was obvious Francis was not aware of how much in our language the word is weighty and offensive.\"\n\nMany media outlets also suggested the pope must not have known what he was saying, given his reputation as the pope of \"Who am I to judge?\" Francis has built a reputation for being LGBTQ+-friendly, so the coverage holds, meaning that he must have used the term almost accidentally, without intending to shock or offend.\n\nWhat should be made of these interpretations?\n\nTo begin, it's true there may be a generational discount to be applied. Francis, after all, is 87, and at times may use outdated expressions in ways that if someone younger were to say it, the effect would be different. My grandad had a heart of gold, but could sometimes use racial vocabulary that would make anybody cringe.\n\nFor another, throughout his career Francis has been known occasionally to indulge in off-color expressions of all sorts. Some find that aspect of his personality crude or off-putting, others see his capacity to employ the argot of the street as part of his pastoral charm ... carrying the \"smell of his sheep,\" as it were. In any event, it's a trait that doesn't necessarily always reflect the pope's developed thinking, but rather something more akin to shooting from the hip.\n\nAnd, yet.\n\nYet, here's the thing. I didn't grow up in an ethnically Italian home like Francis, I haven't spoken Italian all my life, and the primary language in which I work every day isn't Italian either. When Francis speaks Italian, he sounds like a native; when I do, I come off as Father Guido Sarducci in reverse, meaning an immigrant in Italy with a comically thick American accent (and, sadly, I'm not doing a bit, it's just how I sound.)\n\nYet, even I know that the word frocio and its variants are strong medicine, and definitely not something you say in mixed company.\n\nI recall distinctly in my first Italian class here in Rome a quarter-century ago, we had a gay teacher, and, at one point, a teenager in the class called him frocio - the response was immediate and unmistakable, with at least a half-dozen people shouting at the poor kid to put a sock in it.\n\nThe bottom line is that it strains credulity, to put it mildly, that Pope Francis simply didn't understand the language he was using. Moreover, it's striking that many of the same people now urging us to believe in the pope's na\u00efvet\u00e9 more typically are the ones extolling his savvy, deeply in-touch command of the moment.\n\nGiven all that, there's another interpretation of his statement to the Italian bishops, which is that he meant what he said: In his view, there's an overly strong element of what is sometimes called a worrying \"gay lifestyle\" in at least some seminary environments, which suggests caution in terms of admitting gay candidates.\n\nAt the moment, CEI is considering a new set of admissions guidelines, a draft of which distinguishes between orientation and behavior in the evaluation of gay candidates. Perhaps Francis deliberately wanted to trigger a yellow light, an invitation to slow down and be careful about inadvertently encouraging unhealthy elements in seminary life.\n\nIs that necessarily what he had in mind?\n\nRight now it's impossible to be sure, but it seems at least as credible as the \"pope didn't know what he was saying\" theory.

The story was first reported by Dagospia, a gossip website before being covered by dailies like La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera.\n\nThe media reports claimed - while quoting unnamed bishops - that the pontiff meant the derogatory terms as a \"joke\" and left those who heard it \"surprised\" and \"perplexed\". One bishop is quoted saying that the pope might not have been familiar with the offensive nature of the term.\n\nTwo newspapers, La Repubblica and Corriere, stated that it was decided that homosexual men should be admitted to seminaries, but the move was vetoed by the pope.\n\nWhat does \"frociaggine\" mean?\n\nThe word \"frociaggine\" stems from the word \"frocio\" that refers to the English term faggot. The term faggot is often used in the Anglosphere to refer to a gay person in a derogatory manner though its shorter fag is also used for cigarettes. Historically, while the term fag/faggot has been used to refer to men perceived to be less masculine it evolved over term to refer to homosexual mean. In recent years, it has also been \"reclaimed\" by gay men, much like the N word was \"reclaimed\" by black folks.\n\nPro-LGBTQ+ pope?\n\nUnlike his predecessors, Francis has taken a more ambiguous approach to the LGBTQ+ community, earning the disdain of more conservative cardinals. In an impromptu press conference on the papal plane when he took over, when asked about gay priests, Francis had said: \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has goodwill, who am I to judge? The catechism of the Catholic Church explains this very well. It says they should not be marginalised because of this [orientation] but that they must be integrated into society.\"\n\nWhile approving a ruling in December 2023 allowing priests to bless unmarried and same-sex couples, he has always been vocal about not allowing gay people to join the clergy and claimed he was \"concerned\" about the \"fashion\" of being gay to which the clergy is \"susceptible\".\n\nPope Francis' ambiguous position is sharply different from his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI who has been a longtime opponent of homosexuality. While opposing same-sex marriage, Benedict had said: \"\"People dispute the idea that they have a nature, given to them by their bodily identity, that serves as a defining element of the human being. They deny their nature and decide that it is not something previously given to them, but that they make it for themselves.\"\n\nThe Church's official position remains that homosexual acts are \"sinful\". A 2016 decree stressed the obligation of sexual abstinence as well as \"barring\" gay men from the clergy.\n\nThe Church and Sexual Abuse\n\nTo say the Catholic Church has had a complicated relationship with sex would be an understatement. While the Church remains steadfastly opposed to abortion and some forms of birth control, it has also had a rather chequered past about dealing with sexual abuse within the clergy.\n\nWhile cases of sexual abuse by the clergy are more documented in various parts of the world, it's almost impossible to pin a number in Italy because of an Italian government treaty with the Vatican the guarantees areas of immunity to bishops and priests.\n\nIn the US, a 2006 documentary called Deliver Us From Evil showed how a priest named Olivier O'Grady was switched from parish to parish to cover up his rape of dozens of children.\n\nSpotlight, a 2015 Academy Award-winning team, also showed a dramatized version of a true story of the Boston Globe's investigative reporting team shone a light on the widespread sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests in the 1970s, and the cover-up attempts of the Boston archdiocese. In 2018, a Pennsylvania grand jury published a 1,356 page report documenting the decades of sexual abuse by over 300 Catholic priests in six dioceses and also accused senior church officials in Pennsylvania and the Vatican of a \"systemic cover-up\".\n\nA Perspective on Clergy Sexual Abuse by Dr Thomas Plante, states that approximately 4% of the priests in the past half century (mostly '60s and '70s) had a sexual experience with a minor. The study claims that the number is \"consistent with male clergy from other religious traditions\" and is \"significantly lower than the general adult male population which may double this number\".\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

God accompanies them... condemning a person like this is a sin.\"\n\nThree months later, the pope spoke to a group of young people about various issues - including LGBTQ+ inclusion - and said: \"God does not reject anybody... God is a father, and I have no right to expel anyone from the Church.\"\n\nSix months on from that, he was praised for saying same-sex couples could have their unions blessed.\n\nHe has also said trans people can be baptised within the Church and act as godparents or witnesses to marriage under the same conditions as any other adult.\n\nHowever, he has remained coy about his exact views on LGBTQ+ people joining the clergy. In 2018, he said: \"In our societies, it even seems that homosexuality is fashionable, and that mentality, in some way, also influences the life of the Church.\"\n\nAnd his latest alleged comments could undo much of the work done to bridge the gap between the Catholicism and the queer community.", "source": {"uri": "thepinknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PinkNews | Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news | LGBTQ+ news"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sophie_perry@thepinknews.com", "name": "Sophie Perry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baptism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Computers_and_Internet", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Computers and Internet", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/History", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Youth", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.thepinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pope-francis-slur.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, there is space for everyone.

He also seemingly defended the use of violence to defend one's faith, saying in 2015 that \"if a good friend speaks badly of my mother, he can expect to get punched\".\n\nMore from this section Chaotic Memorial Day weekend at the Jersey Shore leads to stabbing, curfew Grayson Murray dies aged 30 just 24 hours after withdrawing from Charles Schwab Challenge Bronx Historical Society offers Mott Haven walking tour, screening of 'Up Jump The Boogie'\n\nAt a meeting with Catholic families in Verona this month, Francis told a joke about a grumpy shopkeeper, pausing halfway through the punchline so it sounded like it would end with a swear word, before correcting himself with a cheeky laugh.\n\n- 'Harmful' language -\n\nBut Francis DeBernardo, head of US LGBTQ Catholic group New Ways Ministry, had told AFP ahead of the Vatican statement that he would welcome an apology from the pope.\n\n\"Pope Francis has not always been clear in his remarks about LGBTQ+ people,\" he said.\n\n\"We hope this incident will encourage him to learn more about the language he uses, and about how misuse can be dangerously harmful.\"\n\nIn Rome on Tuesday, some visitors also expressed dismay at the words used by such an important spiritual leader.\n\n\"I'm shocked.

To access the content, check your email and follow the instructions provided.\n\nPope Francis apologized for using harsh language about homosexuality during a closed-door meeting with Italian bishops, The Vatican said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nItalian news outlet Dagospia broke the news on Monday that Pope Francis told the Italian Episcopal Conference in a private meeting that there is already too much \"f-----ness\" in some seminaries and reaffirming that homosexuals should not be allowed to enter the priesthood.\n\nSimilar reports appeared in Italian outlets Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica following the alleged comments, which were not recorded.\n\n\"Pope Francis is aware of the articles that came out recently about a conversation, behind closed doors, with the bishops of the CEI (Italian Episcopal Conference),\" the Vatican said in a Tuesday statement.\n\nPOPE FRANCIS: 'GENDER IDEOLOGY' IS ONE OF THE 'MOST DANGEROUS IDEOLOGICAL COLONIZATIONS'\n\nThe Vatican appeared to confirm the reports, but emphasized that the comment did not renege on Francis' assertion that all people are called to the Church, regardless of their personal issues or sin.\n\n\"As he has said on several occasions, 'In the Church there is room for everyone, for everyone! No one is useless, no one is superfluous, there is room for everyone. Just as we are, everyone,'\" the Tuesday statement continued.\n\nThe Vatican press office added that the pope \"never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who felt offended by the use of a term, reported by others.\"\n\nPOPE FRANCIS CORRECTS '60 MINUTES' ON CHURCH NOT BLESSING SAME-SEX UNIONS: 'THAT IS NOT THE SACRAMENT'\n\nThe Vatican has ruled since 2005 that homosexual men cannot be considered for the priesthood. The pope himself has reaffirmed this decision on multiple occasions.\n\nFrancis' comment comes on the heels of a \"60 Minutes\" interview in which he rebuked his interviewer for conflating the blessings of homosexual individuals with blessings of same-sex unions.\n\nIn the conversation with \"60 Minutes,\" the pontiff was asked about the Vatican's recent document approving \"blessings\" of individual Catholics who are in same-sex unions. The Church recognizes the sacrament of marriage as an indissoluble union between a man and a woman.\n\n\"Last year you decided to allow Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples,\" journalist Norah O'Donnell said. \"That's a big change. Why?\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"No, what I allowed was not to bless the union. That cannot be done because that is not the sacrament [of marriage]. I cannot. The Lord made it that way,\" the pope responded.\n\nHe continued, \"But to bless each person, yes. The blessing is for everyone. For everyone. To bless a homosexual-type union, however, goes against the given right, against the law of the Church. But to bless each person, why not? The blessing is for all. Some people were scandalized by this. But why? Everyone!

from the Pope over the use of language seen as homophobic has been welcomed by a UK Catholic LGBT+ group.\n\nHe was widely reported by Italian media to have used the term \"frociaggine\", considered derogatory, when answering no to a question on whether gay men should be admitted to seminaries to train for the priesthood.\n\nThe reports sparked criticism, with a London-based LGBT+ Catholic group describing the language as offensive and disappointing.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said: \"The Pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others.\"\n\nMartin Pendergast, secretary of LGBT+ Catholics Westminster Pastoral Council, said: \"Given the media frenzy that there has been around this, I think it is very significant that an apology has come so swiftly and he clearly recognised not just that he is sorry for those who might have been hurt but also that it was homophobic language.\"\n\nThe remark was said to have been made behind closed doors to Italian bishops on May 20.\n\nItalian is not the Argentine pope's first language and he is said to often speak informally, using slang at times in private.\n\nMr Pendergast said the Pope \"should be more careful about how he phrases things, particularly in these kind of off-the-cuff remarks.\n\n\"I think he tends to use these slang words without understanding the ramifications they can have.\"\n\nHe said the remark will not be a step back for relations for the church and its gay members and questioned the way in which the comment had emerged from the private meeting.\n\nHe said: \"I just wonder what the rationale was for whoever released this to the media, was it used to weaponise against the Pope's more consistent LGBT+ welcoming approach?\n\n\"It would have been better to have challenged the comment within the meeting (rather than leaking it).\"\n\nAsked about the comment, a spokesman for the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales (CBCEW) said: \"Echoing the consistent message of the Synod and this papacy, the Catholic Church is a place of welcome for all.\"\n\nIn 2013, Pope Francis was reported to have indicated he would not judge priests for their sexual orientation, saying: \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\"\n\nIn December last year he formally approved allowing priests to bless same-sex couples, as long as such blessings do not give the impression of a marriage ceremony, reversing a 2021 policy by the Vatican's doctrine office, which barred such blessings on the grounds that God \"does not and cannot bless sin\".\n\nThe Pope's most recent reported comment came as LGBT+ Catholics Westminster marked its 25th anniversary with a celebratory Mass on Sunday.\n\nBishop Paul McAleenan, Auxiliary Bishop of Westminster, who represented Cardinal Vincent Nichols at the

"body": "An apology from the Pope over the use of language seen as homophobic has been welcomed by a UK Catholic LGBT+ group.\n\nHe was widely reported by Italian media to have used the term \"frociaggine\", considered derogatory, when answering no to a question on whether gay men should be admitted to seminaries to train for the priesthood.\n\nThe reports sparked criticism, with a London-based LGBT+ Catholic group describing the language as offensive and disappointing.\n\nThe Pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said: \"The Pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others.\"\n\nMartin Pendergast, secretary of LGBT+ Catholics Westminster Pastoral Council, said: \"Given the media frenzy that there has been around this, I think it is very significant that an apology has come so swiftly and he clearly recognised not just that he is sorry for those who might have been hurt but also that it was homophobic language.\"\n\nThe remark was said to have been made behind closed doors to Italian bishops on May 20.\n\nItalian is not the Argentine pope's first language and he is said to often speak informally, using slang at times in private.\n\nMr Pendergast said the Pope \"should be more careful about how he phrases things, particularly in these kind of off-the-cuff remarks.\n\n\"I think he tends to use these slang words without understanding the ramifications they can have.\"\n\nI think he tends to use these slang words without understanding the ramifications they can have\n\nHe said the remark will not be a step back for relations for the church and its gay members and questioned the way in which the comment had emerged from the private meeting.\n\nHe said: \"I just wonder what the rationale was for whoever released this to the media, was it used to weaponise against the Pope's more consistent LGBT+ welcoming approach?\n\n\"It would have been better to have challenged the comment within the meeting (rather than leaking it).\"\n\nAsked about the comment, a spokesman for the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales (CBCEW) said: \"Echoing the consistent message of the Synod and this papacy, the Catholic Church is a place of welcome for all.\"\n\nIn 2013, Pope Francis was reported to have indicated he would not judge priests for their sexual orientation, saying: \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\"\n\nIn December last year he formally approved allowing priests to bless same-sex couples, as long as such blessings do not give the impression of a marriage ceremony, reversing a 2021 policy by the Vatican's doctrine office, which barred such blessings on the grounds that God \"does not and cannot bless sin\".\n\nThe Pope's most recent reported comment came as LGBT+ Catholics Westminster marked its 25th anniversary with a celebratory Mass on Sunday.\n\nBishop Paul McAleenan, Auxiliary Bishop of Westminster, who represented Cardinal Vincent Nichols at the service, told the congregation that the church \"must never be closed, it must always be a church that includes and makes room for all\".\n\nHe thanked the LGBT+ group for its \"value\" and \"contribution to the life of the church\".", "source": {"uri": "kentonline.co.uk",

Bruni said.\n\nPope Francis and the Vatican have faced enormous pressure in recent days after a report was published in Italian blog Dagospia, roughly the country's equivalent of the Drudge Report, stating that the pope had used an off-color slang term referring to homosexuals during a recent session with members of CEI.\n\nRELATED: Is Pope's PR safety net misrepresenting his use of slang?\n\nOn May 20, Francis addressed the spring plenary assembly of the CEI in the Vatican's synod hall, speaking behind closed doors to some 230 bishops as well as other clergy and supporting staff.\n\nThough Francis's meetings with CEI are typically held privately, meaning the Vatican doesn't release an official transcript, several days after the meeting news leaked that the pope had addressed the issue of admitting homosexual men to Catholic seminaries.\n\nAccording to the reports, Francis urged caution on this front, saying there was too much frociaggine in seminaries, loosely meaning \"faggotry.\"\n\nThe reports generated immediate backlash against the pope, including from some who were shocked to hear that the pope famous for the quip, \"Who am I to judge?\" and who has been seen as a champion of LGBTQ+ inclusion in the Catholic Church, apparently used such crude terms.\n\nWhile the Vatican's statement took ownership of the fallout and apologized, it stopped short of admitting that Pope Francis had used the term, meaning there is still no formal acknowledgement from the Vatican of the pope's casual use of the slang.\n\nHis apparent remark comes as CEI, grappling with a worrying vocations crisis, is evaluating a new set admissions guidelines for seminaries, a draft of which draws a distinction between orientation and active behavior in potential candidates.",

have been better to have challenged the comment within the meeting (rather than leaking it).\"\n\nAsked about the comment, a spokesman for the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales (CBCEW) said: \"Echoing the consistent message of the Synod and this papacy, the Catholic Church is a place of welcome for all.\"\n\nIn 2013, Pope Francis was reported to have indicated he would not judge priests for their sexual orientation, saying: \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\"\n\nIn December last year he formally approved allowing priests to bless same-sex couples, as long as such blessings do not give the impression of a marriage ceremony, reversing a 2021 policy by the Vatican's doctrine office, which barred such blessings on the grounds that God \"does not and cannot bless sin\".\n\nThe Pope's most recent reported comment came as LGBT+ Catholics Westminster marked its 25th anniversary with a celebratory Mass on Sunday.\n\nBishop Paul McAleenan, Auxiliary Bishop of Westminster, who represented Cardinal Vincent Nichols at the service, told the congregation that the church \"must never be closed, it must always be a church that includes and makes room for all\".\n\nHe thanked the LGBT+ group for its \"value\" and \"contribution to the life of the church\".", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

"A Vatican spokesman said the Pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms.\n\nAn apology from the Pope over the use of language seen as homophobic has been welcomed by a UK Catholic LGBT+ group.\n\nHe was widely reported by Italian media to have used the term \"frociaggine\", considered derogatory, when answering no to a question on whether gay men should be admitted to seminaries to train for the priesthood.\n\nThe reports sparked criticism, with a London-based LGBT+ Catholic group describing the language as offensive and disappointing.\n\nMartin Pendergast, secretary of LGBT+ Catholics Westminster Pastoral Council, said: \"Given the media frenzy that there has been around this, I think it is very significant that an apology has come so swiftly and he clearly recognised not just that he is sorry for those who might have been hurt but also that it was homophobic language.\"\n\nThe remark was said to have been made behind closed doors to Italian bishops on May 20.\n\nItalian is not the Argentine pope's first language and he is said to often speak informally, using slang at times in private.\n\nMr Pendergast said the Pope \"should be more careful about how he phrases things, particularly in these kind of off-the-cuff remarks.\n\n\"I think he tends to use these slang words without understanding the ramifications they can have.\"\n\nHe said: \"I just wonder what the rationale was for whoever released this to the media, was it used to weaponise against the Pope's more consistent LGBT+ welcoming approach?\n\n\"It would have been better to have challenged the comment within the meeting (rather than leaking it).\"\n\nAsked about the comment, a spokesman for the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales (CBCEW) said: \"Echoing the consistent message of the Synod and this papacy, the Catholic Church is a place of welcome for all.\"\n\nIn 2013, Pope Francis was reported to have indicated he would not judge priests for their sexual orientation, saying: \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\"\n\nIn December last year he formally approved allowing priests to bless same-sex couples, as long as such blessings do not give the impression of a marriage ceremony, reversing a 2021 policy by the Vatican's doctrine office, which barred such blessings on the grounds that God \"does not and cannot bless sin\".\n\nThe Pope's most recent reported comment came as LGBT+ Catholics Westminster marked its 25th anniversary with a celebratory Mass on Sunday.\n\nBishop Paul McAleenan, Auxiliary Bishop of Westminster, who represented Cardinal Vincent Nichols at the service, told the congregation that the church \"must never be closed, it must always be a church that includes and makes room for all\".\n\nHe thanked the LGBT+ group for its \"value\" and \"contribution to the life of the church\".", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The meeting was about whether gay people should be allowed to join seminaries and train to become priests in the Catholic Church as long as they respect the vow of celibacy required of priests.\n\n\"It seems that Pope Francis has a more radical vision: to avoid problems of this kind, homosexual persons should not be admitted to the seminary. Full stop!\" reported Il Corriere della Sera.\n\nAccording to La Repubblica, the Pope told the bishops that if a gay person tries to join a seminary, they should be barred, explaining that \"there is too much frociaggine in seminaries.\"\n\nThe word frociaggine means something roughly like \"queerness,\" but is derived from the same word as the slur \"f****t,\" and has a pejorative sense.\n\nWhile a Vatican spokesman quickly released a statement apologizing for the Pope \"express[ing] himself in homophobic terms,\" online conservatives reacted to the initial news with glee.\n\nThe newfound support of Francis is a change from just last week, when the far-right compared him to Satan after he preached a message of love and tolerance for migrants.\n\n\"The Pope called someone a f****t?\" posted Brenden Dilley happily on X on Tuesday in reaction to the news, over an edited GIF of the Hulk calling the \"Based Department.\"\n\nDilley is behind the Dilley Meme Team, a pro-former President Donald Trump meme-creating collective which claims close links to the president and his campaign circle. Dilley and his team of meme makers were also recently behind a video Trump posted on Truth Social with a graphic of a newspaper headline making reference to a \"Unified Reich,\" which prompted an intense outcry.\n\n\"This news made my morning, I had to look it up, it was very wholesome. Thanks!\" replied @The_Wireman to Dilley.\n\nOthers echoed the sentiment that the Pope had gone based.\n\nSome said that the Pope using a homophobic term made them like him more, given his public reputation as a church leader who's been unusually accepting of gay people.\n\n\"First time I'm in agreement with him,\" posted @Radtech_63.\n\nAfter news came out that the Pope had apologized for causing offense though, some posters complained that he didn't have his priorities in order.\n\n\"Of course he apologizes, because rather than doing the will of God, he prefers pandering to the woke,\" wrote @Eye_C_U_Smith.\n\n\"The Pope just apologized for one of the most based things he's said,\" wrote @EvangelicalDW.", "source": {"uri": "dailydot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Dot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marlon_ettinger@dailydot.com", "name": "Marlon Ettinger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerical_celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clerical celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corriere della Sera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Repubblica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Repubblica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Computers_and_Internet", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Computers and Internet", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://uploads.dailydot.com/2024/05/pope-homophobic-slur.jpg?auto=compress&fm=pjpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602804", "eventUri": "eng-9602804", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

I think it is disappointing. He should be more careful about how he phrases things, particularly in these kind of off-the-cuff remarks Martin Pendergast, LGBT+ Catholics Westminster\n\nMartin Pendergast, secretary of LGBT+ Catholics Westminster Pastoral Council, told the PA news agency: \"If it is as it has been reported it is offensive. I think it is disappointing. He should be more careful about how he phrases things, particularly in these kind of off-the-cuff remarks.\n\n\"I think he tends to use these slang words without understanding the ramifications they can have.\"\n\nBut, asked whether he feels the remark will be a step back for relations for the church and its gay members, Mr Pendergast replied \"certainly not\" and questioned the way in which the comment had emerged from the private meeting.\n\nPope Francis reportedly made a derogatory comment relating to gay priests (Danny Lawson/PA)\n\nHe said: \"I just wonder what the rationale was for whoever released this to the media - was it used to weaponise against the Pope's more consistent LGBT+ welcoming approach?\n\n\"It would have been better to have challenged the comment within the meeting (rather than leaking it).\"\n\nAsked about the comment, a spokesman from the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales (CBCEW) said: \"Echoing the consistent message of the Synod and this papacy, the Catholic Church is a place of welcome for all.\"\n\nIn 2013, Pope Francis was reported to have indicated he would not judge priests for their sexual orientation, saying: \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\"\n\nIn December last year he formally approved allowing priests to bless same-sex couples, as long as such blessings do not give the impression of a marriage ceremony, reversing a 2021 policy by the Vatican's doctrine office, which barred such blessings on the grounds that God \"does not and cannot bless sin\".\n\nThe Pope's most recent reported comment came as LGBT+ Catholics Westminster marked its 25th anniversary, with a celebratory Mass on Sunday.\n\nBishop Paul McAleenan, who is Auxiliary Bishop of Westminster and was representing Cardinal Vincent Nichols at the service, told those gathered that the church \"must never be closed, it must always be a church that includes and makes room for all\".\n\nHe thanked the LGBT+ group for its \"value\" and \"contribution to the life of the church\".", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

office, which barred such blessings on the grounds that God \"does not and cannot bless sin\".\n\nThe Pope's most recent reported comment came as LGBT+ Catholics Westminster marked its 25th anniversary, with a celebratory Mass on Sunday.\n\nBishop Paul McAleenan, who is Auxiliary Bishop of Westminster and was representing Cardinal Vincent Nichols at the service, told those gathered that the church \"must never be closed, it must always be a church that includes and makes room for all\".\n\nHe thanked the LGBT+ group for its \"value\" and \"contribution to the life of the church\".",

year he formally approved allowing priests to bless same-sex couples, as long as such blessings do not give the impression of a marriage ceremony, reversing a 2021 policy by the Vatican's doctrine office, which barred such blessings on the grounds that God \"does not and cannot bless sin\".\n\nThe Pope's most recent reported comment came as LGBT+ Catholics Westminster marked its 25th anniversary, with a celebratory Mass on Sunday.\n\nBishop Paul McAleenan, who is Auxiliary Bishop of Westminster and was representing Cardinal Vincent Nichols at the service, told those gathered that the church \"must never be closed, it must always be a church that includes and makes room for all\".\n\nHe thanked the LGBT+ group for its \"value\" and \"contribution to the life of the church\".",

The arguments are expected to last the entire day. It's the last chance for attorneys to address the Manhattan jury before it starts deliberating Trump's fate.

A military official, speaking on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement, says the military fired two 17-kilogram (37-pound) munitions that targeted two senior Hamas militants. The official says the munitions would have been too small to ignite a fire on their own, and the army is looking into the possibility that weapons were stored in the area.

Dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state. But none of the major Western powers has done so.

In-person activities have been eliminated or severely cut back, and staffing has been reduced. Voting rights experts say it's another tactic to strip access to the ballot box, especially for minority voters, who mostly benefit from third-party voter registration.\n\nPope apologizes after being quoted using vulgar term about gay men in talk about ban on gay priests\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope Francis has apologized after he was quoted using a vulgar term about gay men to reaffirm the Catholic Church's ban on gay priests. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni issued a statement Tuesday acknowledging the media storm that erupted about Francis' comments. They were delivered behind closed doors to Italian bishops on May 20.Italian media on Monday had quoted unnamed Italian bishops in reporting that Francis jokingly used the term \"faggotness\" while speaking in Italian during the encounter. He had used the term in reaffirming the Vatican's ban on allowing gay men to enter seminaries and be ordained priests.\n\nToday's Top Headlines List of alleged broken promises by Weeping Willows developer continues to grow Column: Remembering Pat Tillman, killed by 'friendly fire' Letter: State leaders have no respect for Aiken Aiken County Republican Party to hold rally in The Alley Saturday 'Always a moving event:' Aiken County ceremony salutes fallen warriors SRNS family scholarships distribute $45k among 15 winners Jackson, Silver Bluff celebrate 3rd annual youth football camp Late Burnettown mayor Hector Rodriguez recognized at Memorial Day ceremony SRS walking tours revisit former town of Ellenton Aiken man continues making a difference in the lives of teens\n\nA look at Pope Francis' comments about LGBTQ+ people\n\nVATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope Francis' apology for using a vulgar term to refer to gay men was the latest comment to make headlines about the Catholic Church's teachings on homosexuality.

Organized crime, though, has long controlled swaths of Mexico through violence and corruption. Since the murder of two Jesuit priests in 2022, Catholic Church leaders have echoed the voices of victims still hurting from extortion, forced displacement and the killings of their loved ones. Now, ahead of the June 2 election, religious leaders and families alike yearn for peace and the government's acknowledgement of their grief.\n\n23 are dead across the US after weekend tornadoes. Texas is getting battered again\n\nDamaging winds and hail have pelted north Texas as much of the U.S. recovers from severe weather that killed at least 23 people during the Memorial Day holiday weekend. Widespread power outages were reported in the region that includes Dallas and Fort Worth. An early-season heat wave is adding to the misery. The weekend's destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky. A possible tornado damaged a high school and a half-dozen homes in Pennsylvania on Monday night. It has been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation's midsection.\n\nFears rise of a second landslide and disease outbreak at site of Papua New Guinea disaster\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Authorities fear a second landslide and a disease outbreak are looming at the scene of Papua New Guinea's mass-casualty disaster. U.N. official Serhan Aktoprak said Tuesday the mass of debris that devastated Yambali village in the South Pacific nation's remote highlands when a limestone mountainside sheared away Friday is becoming more unstable with recent rain and streams trapped between the ground and rubble. The United Nations' migrant agency has officials at the scene in Enga province helping shelter 1,600 displaced people. The agency estimates 670 villagers have died, while Papua New Guinea's government has told the United Nations it thinks more than 2,000 were buried.\n\nMore people make 'no-buy year' pledges as overspending or climate worries catch up with them\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- The self-imposed rules of a no-buy challenge are simple: participants pledge to stop buying non-essential items, be they unneeded shoes, additional beauty products or other impulse buys for a set amount of time, usually 12 months. What started several years ago as a blogged-about experiment in budgeting and mindful spending has become a popular trend on social media. A Reddit group where people share their experiences has 51,000 members. On TikTok, some users post videos to hold themselves accountable that get hundreds of thousands of views. Not everyone electing to join the no-buy trend has debt. Some participants say they want to do their part to reduce waste and protect the environment.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors":

"body": "Pope Francis' homophobic slur is being dismissed as no big deal, especially considering most seminaries are mostly made up of gay dudes ... so claims one priest anyway.\n\nFather James Alison -- a practicing Catholic and theologian in Madrid, and who's openly gay -- shared his POV on \"TMZ Live\" Tuesday ... explaining when the Pope speaks to Italian bishops behind closed doors, he's most likely addressing a group primarily composed of gay men -- with FJA theorizing he's likely fully aware of their sexuality 'cause he lives with them.\n\nTherefore, Father James says he likely used the term in a positive/light-hearted context, among people he knows, rather than in a negative way typically associated with the term.\n\nFather James speaks from experience ... noting while he hasn't used the exact slur the Pope did, he's used similar terminology in talks himself, which might traditionally be deemed offensive -- but stands by his thoughts that it's really no biggie and nothing worth sweating.\n\nBut back to the situation at hand -- Father James explains it like this ... he says among bishops, there's usually a group of gay men who hypocritically believe the Church's ban on gays doesn't apply to them personally -- but they don't have any issue imposing it on others.\n\nAs we reported, the Pope referenced \"fa**otness\" while defending the Church's ban on gays becoming priests during a discussion with bishops behind closed doors at the Vatican last week.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni issued an apology of sorts, saying ... \"The Pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported by others.\"\n\nIt goes without saying, the backlash over the Pope's comments was significant ... with even Wilson Cruz -- a gay actor known for his roles in 'Star Trek' and \"Mother of the Bride\" -- speaking out to TMZ Tuesday and crapping on his holiness' slip of the tongue.\n\nCruz expressed disappointment in the language used by the Pope, especially considering his role in leading discussions on change within the Catholic Church.\n\nHe told us that's one of the reasons he's EP-ing his new doc, \"Not Part Of The Plan\" ... which aims to invite religious leaders into an important conversation about the LGBTQ+ crowd.", "source": {"uri": "tmz.com",

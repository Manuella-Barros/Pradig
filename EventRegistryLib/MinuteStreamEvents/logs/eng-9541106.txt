It was later revealed that Lawler had a stroke, but he had underwent surgery and was expected to make a full recovery. Lawler previously had a stroke in 2018 as well as a heart attack back in 2012 during a match on Monday Night Raw. He reappeared in August when he was backstage at a Raw taping in Memphis. He was brought out to the entrance ramp by Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens, which was a delight to fans in attendance.\n\nLawler recently spoke out about his condition post-stroke during a signing for East Coast Autograph Auctions. He explained that his health is great, though there are still some minor difficulties that he's dealing with from it. \"My health is great,\" Lawler said. \"I'm just getting over for the doctors to get back on the road for my knee replacement and then, of course, there are still some minor difficulties from the stroke, but all that stuff is coming around fast.\"\n\nLawler has over five decades of experience in the wrestling business. His in-ring career began back in the 1970s. He joined Continental Wrestling Association where he became the biggest star in the promotion. He'd go on to have stints in the American Wrestling Association and WCCW, owned by the Von Erich family. He eventually made his way to WWE (then WWF) as an announcer but he did appear in the 1993 Royal Rumble match.\n\nHe remained a regular member of the WWE team until about 2016. He'd be saved for special occasions thereafter. He's taken a backseat from wrestling in recent years but was brought back in to the commentary for WWE back in 2019. He was later replaced by Samoa Joe just over a year later. Since then, he's had sporadic appearances in the company but has been much more active on the independent circuit. Up until his stroke last year, he had still been wrestling on a semi-regular basis. His last match was against former Ring of Honor wrestler Beer City Bruiser at America's Most Liked Wrestling Acts of War Games 2 in North Carolina.\n\nStay tuned to Comicbook for updates on Jerry Lawler and WWE.\n\nH/T: Fightful", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Lawler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_Zayn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sami Zayn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Wrestling_Association", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Continental Wrestling Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_City_Bruiser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beer City Bruiser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rumble_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Rumble match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Erich_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Von Erich family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Wrestling_Association", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Wrestling Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Class_Championship_Wrestling", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Class Championship Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Honor", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ring of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/04/25/c5c8c298-f78c-4c67-99e4-5092cb1a6dc8/jerry-lawler-wwe-raw-1215422.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541106", "eventUri": "eng-9541106", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Lawler recently took part in a virtual autograph signing for East Coast Autograph Auctions and revealed he has undergone knee replacement surgery. Lawler said he was also still having some minor difficulties from the stroke but said \"all that stuff is coming around fast.\" There is no word on if Lawler, 74, will be able to return to the ring.\n\nLawler has had quite the career. Check out his time in WWE:\n\nOpinion: That's great to hear and hopefully Lawler can get everything else he needs taken care of soon. Having his knee replaced is great and should allow him to do a lot more. At the same time, the fact that he is able to do something like a virtual signing should mean a lot of the stroke effects have worn off. Lawler has already had a heck of a career and it will be nice to see him get back to full health going forward.\n\nYou can find more from Thomas Hall at kbwrestlingreviews.com, or check out his- Amazon author page with 30 wrestling books.", "source": {"uri": "wrestlingrumors.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "WrestlingRumors.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_hall@wrestlingrumors.net", "name": "Thomas Hall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Lawler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knee replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Easter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling ring"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.wrestlingrumors.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/26200319/Jerry-The-King-Lawler.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541106", "eventUri": "eng-9541106", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Lawler battled health issues, replaced on commentary in 2020, only sporadically appeared since. New era in WWE means changes; previous ownership would've kept Lawler around in some capacity.\n\nJerry 'The King' Lawler is no longer under WWE contract, according to a report by PWInsider, bringing an end to his 23-year run with the company in a working capacity.\n\nJerry Lawler And WWE Part Ways\n\nLawler's most recent contract ran out at the onset of this year, with WWE quietly choosing not to renew his broadcast deal. It's news that has only started making the rounds within wrestling circles during the past few weeks as this has seemingly been made lowkey.\n\nThere's been no official reason given for the decision at this point, but he hasn't worked full-time on commentary since 2020 when he was replaced by Samoa Joe. Since that point, he's been working sporadically, with his most recent appearance being last November on WWE NXT when he chose the Iron Survivor participants.\n\nLawler has also dealt with some health complications in recent times as he unfortunately suffered a stroke back in February of last year. Thankfully, Lawler was able to make a full recovery from that to continue with his daily life.\n\nIt was also noted by a source to PWInsider that although Lawler is no longer under a broadcasting deal, he does still have a Legends contract.\n\nHow Would The Previous Ownership Have Handled This?\n\nClose\n\nAccording to the report, one source noted that under the previous ownership, Lawler is someone who would have always been 'taken care of.' He'd have been kept within the company in some capacity, but with WWE embarking on a new era, those times are changing.\n\nLawler has barely been used on television in recent years, even when Vince McMahon was still in control of the company. The WWE Hall Of Famer has typically made sporadic appearances on Legends nights, for one-off commentary appearances, or as part of WWE's pre-show panels.\n\nMore recently the company has opted to use the likes of Big E and CM Punk on the pre-show with legends such as Booker T and JBL making appearances.\n\nRelated Every WWE Release From April 2024: What Should They Do Next?

He has been recovering from a stroke he had in February 2023, as well as knee replacement surgery. PWI noted that when they contacted people to confirm Lawler was no longer with the company, they were met with surprise from some.\n\nOne source noted that under the previous regime, Lawler would have been \"taken care of\" and signed in some way, but this is a \"new era.\"\n\nThe source added: \"The old company is dead. People can say they hate Vince [McMahon] and Kevin [Dunn] all they want, and they'd be right to do so, but certain people would have been taken care of. Lawler would have been one, but this isn't the old WWE.

However, new information has surfaced about his status with WWE.\n\nPWInsider reported today that Jerry Lawler has officially parted ways with WWE. Sources suggest that WWE quietly chose not to renew Lawler's broadcasting contract, marking the end of a partnership that began in December 1992 when he made a surprise debut on WWF Prime Time Wrestling. It was further noted that the contract with WWE expired at the start of 2024.\n\nHowever, according to an update from Mike Johnson of PWInsider on Twitter, it was clarified that WWE has confirmed Jerry Lawler still has a Legends contract. It's his full-time broadcasting contract that expired and wasn't renewed. The Legends deal allows him to maintain a relationship with WWE, but he no longer has a regular role on their broadcasting team.\n\n\"FYI - WWE has reached out to state Jerry Lawler would still have a Legends deal. Want to make that clear. His full-time broadcasting contract was what lapsed and was not re-signed. - Mike\"\n\nDue to him being on a Legends contract, fans shouldn't expect Jerry Lawler to be part of AEW or any other major promotion.

It's reported that the company quietly opted out of renewing Jerry Lawler's broadcasting contract, and the decision is shocking to this fan. In short, don't expect to see him on upcoming WWE shows after decades of having some TV presence within the company.\n\nReports from PWInsider allege that while WWE dropped Jerry Lawler's broadcasting contract, he still has a Legends agreement in place. Based on what we know about those deals, Lawler will reportedly still receive a cut when his image and likeness are used. Still, this move would end an era between \"The King'\"and the wrestling company that has spanned decades, and one has to wonder why.\n\nWhile there's no reported reason for why WWE allegedly declined to renew the broadcaster's contract, one could mention his health. Many WWE superstars like Ric Flair and Matt Hardy reached out in February 2023 when he suffered a medical emergency, which was later revealed to be a stroke. Months later, the WWE welcomed Lawler out to greet his hometown Memphis crowd in a brief segment in which the legendary broadcaster did not speak. He also had a segment air during an NXT episode in November, which can be heard below:\n\nIt was a solid segment, though it didn't exude the type of energy Jerry Lawler is usually known for in his WWE commentary. The legend did indicate during a signing with East Coast Autograph Auctions that his health is improving, though we cannot say for sure whether he's fully on the mend. Considering the WWE has not announced anything officially, this could be a case where Lawler is not contracted at the moment. Still, he could theoretically be signed again later should he improve enough to jump back on commentary for pre-shows or to fill in for commentators as he did for Corey Graves back in 2022.\n\nIf this is the end of Jerry Lawler broadcasting for WWE, it's a quiet finale for one of the most iconic voices of the company. Anyone who has revisited some of his most iconic calls with a Peacock Premium subscription in 2024 can attest that not every performance has aged well in terms of content. At the same time, Lawler nearly died while calling commentary for the brand, and one would think he'd get a better send-off than the one he was reportedly given.\n\nJerry Lawler's reported release might be seen as one of the more critical decisions of the WWE era, as the company continues to shed relationships with talent that were otherwise seen as vital during the Vince McMahon era. Beyond McMahon himself, another to be let go was Kevin Dunn -- who was largely responsible for the on-camera look of the company -- as he tendered his resignation at the end of 2023. With a big name like Lawler potentially only on board with a Legends contract, I'll be eager to see how other talent negotiations with other big names carry out as the year continues.\n\nMonday Night Raw airs on USA on Mondays at 8:00 p.m. ET. Tune in to see the aftermath of WWE Backlash as well as what will be the start of the big King and Queen of the Ring tournaments. We'll also see if any official news on Jerry Lawler's WWE status arrives in the coming days.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Lawler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Flair", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ric Flair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Hardy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Hardy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_(WWE_brand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NXT (WWE brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Backlash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Backlash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Graves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Graves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_McMahon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vince McMahon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Network"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MmsGeSr3byXRYujwg3djZ8-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541106", "eventUri": "eng-9541106", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

You can check out some highlights below:\n\nOn the origins of Lawler becoming The King: \"Bobby Shane went off to Australia, and he was the king of wrestling. And look, there's been -- I think I'm certain people are going to say, 'Oh, there was a king in Texas,' or 'There's a king in San Francisco.' But Bobby Shane, working in the Atlanta territory, and my dad would go down and book and had a relationship and through the years. But you know, the story goes -- and Lawler done some shots down there. But when he left, they had a conversation and you know, you got to remember this is '72, '73, '74. There was another king in town, and I'm talking about Memphis. And that'd be Elvis Aaron Presley, the king of rock & roll. So Memphis has had some royalty down there. So the king of wrestling became Jerry Lawler. And man, oh man, did that moniker stick and he truly, I guess you could say, fulfill it. Because I mean, it was just amazing how through the years he wrapped that into promos. People to this day, you know, he morphed into it. But yeah The King Jerry Lawler was, I guess you could say, knighted from King Bobby Shane.\"\n\nOn the famous hair vs. car match against Bill Dundee: \"Him and Dundee got into it. And people knew that Dundee was married, and his wife Beverly. And the circumstances presented itself that actually, as the chips fell, Dundee wanted that Southern Heavyweight Championship, and wanted revenge and everything that went with it. He put his wife's hair up. And when would the viewer sitting at home going, 'Now, wait a minute. I can kind of understand. Either Lawler is going to lose their hair or maybe a belt. Okay so now it's Lawler and Dundee hair versus hair. Okay, well, wait a minute. There's a situation where Dundee's wife could possibly lose her hair? No way.' Well again, 52 weeks a year, episodic storytelling, you damn right they showed up. Because Beth put her hair up, and I wish we had an image of that to show because it's just -- what a story, what a just that's Memphis wrestling 101.\"", "source": {"uri": "411mania.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "411mania\u2019s Comment Policy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_ravens@411mania.com", "name": "Andrew Ravens", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Shane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Shane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jarrett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Jarrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Lawler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Dundee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Dundee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dundee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dundee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Presley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Hair", "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Hair", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://411mania.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jerry-Lawler-USWA-Championship-Wrestling.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541106", "eventUri": "eng-9541106", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Although he briefly appeared on WWE television after the health scare, recent developments suggest that Lawler has bid farewell to the WWE universe.\n\nReports from PWInsider reveal that Jerry Lawler has officially parted ways with WWE. Sources indicate that WWE quietly opted not to extend Lawler's broadcast contract, bringing an end to a relationship that began in December 1992 when Lawler made a surprising debut on WWF Prime Time Wrestling. It's been confirmed that his contract with WWE expired at the beginning of 2024.\n\nThe news of Lawler's departure from WWE has only started circulating in recent weeks. This timing, in part, can be attributed to Lawler's low profile as he focused on recuperating from the stroke he suffered in February 2023. Given Lawler's extensive history with WWE and his previous health scare involving a live television heart attack, his exit from the company has caught many in the industry off guard.\n\nInsiders suggest that under the previous leadership of WWE, Lawler would likely have been retained in some capacity, given his substantial contributions to the company over the years. However, with the recent corporate restructuring described as ushering in a \"new era,\" such long-standing relationships seem less assured.\n\nOne source commented, \"The old company is dead. People can say they hate Vince [McMahon] and Kevin [Dunn] all they want, and they'd be right to do so, but certain people would have been taken care of. Lawler would have been one, but this isn't the old WWE. Howard Finkel, God bless him, wouldn't have had a job for life here anymore, either.\"\n\nDespite the surprise of Lawler's departure, fans can take solace in the fact that he remains in good health. Lawler's tenure in WWE saw him become an iconic figure in professional wrestling, known for his energetic commentary, sharp wit, and unforgettable rivalries. His contributions spanned over three decades, shaping some of WWE's most memorable moments. As Lawler embarks on the next chapter post-WWE, fans eagerly await to see what's in store for the legendary wrestler from Memphis.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Jerry Lawler's exit from WWE?

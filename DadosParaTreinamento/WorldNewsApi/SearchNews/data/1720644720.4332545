In an email interview with Sara Germano of the Financial Times, Henry indicated Red Sox fans have unrealistic expectations for the franchise. \"Because fans expect championships almost annually,\" he said, \"they easily become frustrated and are not going to buy into what the odds actually are: one in 20 or one in 30.\" Despite some of the fan unrest, Henry dismissed any notion of selling the MLB club. \"My wife and I live and work in Boston,\" Henry explained. \"We are committed to the city, the region. So the Sox are not going to come up for sale. We generally don't sell assets.\" Another topic that Henry addressed was Red Sox chairman Tom Werner's comments during the offseason when he said they would go \"full throttle\" in an attempt to improve the roster for the 2024 season: \"(Werner's comments) overshadowed every other word, paragraph and interview of the winter because it reaches so deeply into the false belief that many fans and media have that you should mortgage the future each year for the present. You have to base acquisitions and dispositions on the future, not the past. That is unpopular generally.\" Werner later attempted to clarify his comment by telling Sean McAdam of MassLive.com they were \"going to be pressing all levers and weren't going to be happy with just one (method)\u2014that includes free agency, trades or talent from Triple and Double A.\" It was another quiet offseason in Boston, at least as far as roster transactions go. The payroll basically stayed the same from 2023 ($182.9 million) to 2024 ($183.3 million), but the biggest move was trading Chris Sale to the Atlanta Braves for Vaughn Grissom. Cooper Criswell and Lucas Giolito were the only free agents who signed MLB deals with the Red Sox. Giolito is unlikely to pitch this season after having an internal brace procedure to repair his UCL in March. The biggest deal that still haunts the Red Sox was trading Mookie Betts to the Los Angeles Dodgers prior to the 2020 season. The move was facilitated in part because Boston wanted to lower its luxury tax payroll. The Dodgers also took David Price, who was owed $96 million on his contract at that point, in the deal. Two of the three players Boston got in the trade\u2014Alex Verdugo and Jeter Downs\u2014are no longer with the organization. Boston also lost Xander Bogaerts in free agency last offseason when he signed an 11-year, $280 million contract with the San Diego Padres. Henry has been the principal owner of the Red Sox since the Fenway Sports Group purchased the franchise prior to the 2002 season. They have won four World Series titles under his ownership, most recently in 2018. The Red Sox haven't made the postseason since 2021. If they miss the playoffs in 2024, it will mark the first time they haven't been in the field in three straight years since 2010-12.", "summary": "Boston Red Sox fans who have been frustrated with how owner John Henry has been running the team in recent years aren't likely come away from a new interview\u2026", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10124026-red-soxs-john-henry-says-fans-have-unrealistic-expectations-wont-sell-team", "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/v1717852463/mduw28zmawvz6d2nqjdk.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:51:25", "author": "Adam Wells", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.074}

Fox was all smiles as she kneeled beside Kelly, who was sitting on the ground for the picture.\n\nWatch the exclusive video above for more on Fox and Kelly's relationship -- and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "johnni_macke@usmagazine.com", "name": "Johnni Macke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Fox", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Megan Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Gun_Kelly_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine Gun Kelly (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_in_the_Switchgrass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midnight in the Switchgrass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Austin_Green", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Austin Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Her_Daddy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Call Her Daddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVIII", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LVIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Megan-Fox-and-MGK-Are-Getting-Along-Better-Than-They-Have-in-Months.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722014", "eventUri": "eng-9722014", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

The two stars - who went public with their relationship in 2020 - have seen their share of ups and downs, however. The issues they've had are what apparently put a strain on their engagement. But, more recently, they both seem to be in a better place, and they were even recently spotted together at a 4th of July party. There's still a question of whether or not Fox and MGK are still planning to take that sacred walk down the aisle, though. Now, following the recent party, a source has dropped details regarding where the couple stands with their engagement.\n\nAs speculation has swirled around the status of the pair's romantic relationship, there was good news for Megan Fox and MGK fans last week. They attended an all-white Independence Day party held by businessman Michael Rubin nearly a week ago. Rubin's shindig, which was held in the Hamptons, was essentially a who's who of Hollywood, with Kim Kardashian, Tom Brady and Megan Thee Stallion among the attendees. Fox and her partner were also photographed and, in the pics, the 38-year-old Transformers alum could be seen smiling while with her 34-year-old partner. At one point, the two also whispered to each other, in what seemed to be a sweet moment.\n\nThis latest public appearance followed the pair's appearances at Stagecoach and at MGK's birthday party in April. They also showed up at the Nemacolin Summer Solstice Celebration in June. All in all, it seems clear that the two are definitely still spending time together. That, however, doesn't necessarily mean that they're looking to exchange vows anytime soon.\n\nAn insider who's reportedly close to the couple spoke to ET about how they're allegedly handling their relationship. The individual emphasized that the Midnight in the Switchgrass alums are making great progress in trying to improve their bond:\n\nET's insider also noted that the two have been seeking professional assistance while trying to mend their relationship. It was reported in the summer of 2023 that both had been attending therapy, which had impacted their romance in positive ways. This latest source also noted that hashing out their issues via that method has been helpful. Yet it doesn't seem like the stars are making marriage a priority as they seek to better understand each other:\n\nMegan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly's engagement was confirmed in January 2022, and the two signified the moment with a video that went viral at the time. In 2023, MGK - whose real name is Colson Baker - was thrust into the center of cheating rumors, at which time his fianc\u00e9 took a break from social media. Fox eventually returned to Instagram that year, calling out the \"baseless news stories\" about alleged infidelity in the relationship. Nevertheless, the pair spent some time apart before reuniting months later.\n\nIt's very difficult to say whether the fan-favorite couple will eventually feel comfortable taking that next step and exchanging wedding rings. But, at the very least, it would seem that they're in a positive place in their relationship and are enjoying each other's company.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erik_swann@cinemablend.com", "name": "Erik Swann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Gun_Kelly_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Machine Gun Kelly (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Fox", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Megan Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transformers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hamptons", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hamptons"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_in_the_Switchgrass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midnight in the Switchgrass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidelity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infidelity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9sp8yfAMTXUUDtognhMHLb-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722014", "eventUri": "eng-9722014", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 427, "textEnd": 438}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

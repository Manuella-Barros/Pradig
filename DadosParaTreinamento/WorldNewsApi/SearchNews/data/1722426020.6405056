{"id": 243264398, "title": "Yours for \u00a3500,000!\u00a0An uninhabited Scottish isle so beautiful and teeming with wildlife it will take...", "text": "There is something splendid about standing on top of the rugged, lichened, 89-acre kingdom of Mullagrach; tasting the salt on my lips from the sea spray, watching the cormorants swirl, listening to the skylarks sing and knowing there\u2019s nothing but water between me and the North Pole. Oh, how very wonderful it must be to be rich. Because this glorious spot \u2014 a teeny island, all cliffs and coves, crags and shags and flowering sedums, and perched right on the northernmost tip of the Summer Isles \u2014 is up for sale. And it could be mine, or yours, for half a million pounds. Plus a bit extra for a sturdy boat to make the 35-minute crossing from the Old Dorney Harbour on the mainland. And another \u00a3395,000, if I fancied snapping up Mullagrach House back on the mainland, to have somewhere comfy and cosy to wait, and wait, and maybe wait a bit longer, for the sea to be calm enough to cross to my very own island. Because, as always, there\u2019s a teeny-weeny catch \u2014 this gorgeous Highlands and Islands utopia is not brilliantly accessible. In fact, at the moment, the only way to get on to it is to climb a rickety-looking series of very vertical, rusty ladders, from a bobbing boat. Until, that is, the wind gets up and the swell reaches a metre high \u2014 which happens alarmingly often, thanks to the vigorous northerlies here \u2014 and then it\u2019s too dangerous. Which means that, as well as being very rich and somewhat agile, any potential purchaser will need to be extremely patient, too \u2014 even just to view the island. Phiddy Robertson, of Galbraith estate agency, who has sold a few islands in her time and is handling the sale, puts it like this: \u2018On this island, nature is in charge. So if nature decides that the wind is too wild or the swell is too great, then you can\u2019t land. Which is a very humbling and grounding experience and makes it so special.\u2019 She\u2019s not joking. We waited nearly three weeks while our lovely boatman Steve Husband, 63, checked his trusty weather-forecasting app \u2014 Windy.app \u2014 on his phone, updating us every few days. \u2018Too windy... too much swell... not for the foreseeable... maybe next week \u2014 I\u2019ll find you some dolphins...\u2019 But finally on Wednesday, after a three-hour drive from Inverness admiring the lochs and wild lupins, we were scudding across the water in Steve\u2019s orange boat in the bright sunshine towards the island. We had strict instructions from the vendor, Chris Bown, that this was to be a day trip only. Because, well, there\u2019s always a risk with Mullagrach that, even when you finally get there, the wind will change and leave you stranded. One previous owner became marooned here with his son for the best part of a week. The swell was too high, winds too fierce and the pair were left cowering in the only man-made cover on the island, an unpleasant plastic shelter, until they were finally rescued by the coastguard. \u2018They were stuck for days,\u2019 says Steve. \u2018You wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be in that thing for a minute. It had no windows and it stank.\u2019 Not surprisingly, within hours of them staggering back onto dry land, the island was up for sale. \u2018They weren\u2019t ever going back,\u2019 says Steve. Chris, who bought it back in 2006, tells me his longest stay was four days. \u2018A bit longer than I\u2019d planned,\u2019 he says, though he had at least built a cabin by then \u2014 more of which later. \u2018You just have to go with it, but it\u2019s a very special place.\u2019 And as we haul ourselves up a rusty ladder (constructed by Steve) and climb out onto the grass, it feels almost shockingly pristine and perfect. As if the volume has been cranked up on our senses. The smells of heather and bracken. The turf, so green and springy and soft it feels like a fairy mattress. The taste of salt and fish and honeysuckle in the air. The swoosh of the waves on the rocks below. The wind. The loud caw, caw, caw of the cormorants and the sweet, sweet song of the skylark. \u2018Sometimes the birds are so bloody loud you can\u2019t hear yourself think,\u2019 says Steve. At the last count, there were at least 22 kinds of bird \u2014 including great skuas, kittiwakes, shags, -fulmars and geese \u2014 as well as two resident otters and more than 95 species of plant or flower, from juniper to orchids, flowering moss to campion. And on a good day, with a sharp eye, you can spot seals, porpoises, dolphins and minke whales. \u2018It\u2019s a great spot for watching the Northern Lights and, if you look really hard, you might see the North Pole\u2026\u2019 smiles Steve. Not forgetting, of course, Chris\u2019s cosy \u2018high-quality, low environmental impact\u2019 cabin, which was made in Switzerland out of super-strong cross-laminated timber. It was erected on the island \u2014 mainly by Steve, by the sound of it \u2014 in 2016 and has everything you could possibly need: log burner, solar-powered fridge, hob, compost loo, two bunks with a stack of carefully curated reading material, and a very welcoming cupboard full of wine, beer, gin and emergency food. The only thing it doesn\u2019t have is Wi-Fi \u2014 and while Chris says it would be possible to have it, he clearly can\u2019t think of anything worse. For him, buying the island was always about respecting its unspoilt wildness by doing as little to it as possible. Of course, if you really wanted to, you could make a few changes. Development would be strictly limited, but if you had money coming out of your ears, you could clear the boulders in the teeny bay and put in a landing jetty. Or just forget about boats altogether and slap a helipad on the bouncy moss and chopper in and out from Inverness Airport. Though both Steve and Phiddy sound horrified at the thought. \u2018That would be completely missing the point,\u2019 they say. \u2018This is not about fast living or -convenience. It challenges you and brings you back in touch with something more honest,\u2019 adds Phiddy. \u2018Just enjoy it.\u2019 On a bright, sunny summer\u2019s day, it\u2019s hard to imagine anywhere more perfect. But, according to Steve, that\u2019s the trap. Yes, the summers are long and light \u2014 around midsummer you can sit outside and still read a book at 11 o\u2019clock at night \u2014 and fantastically energising, if prone to midges. But they\u2019re also unreliable. \u2018You could buy it tomorrow and it could rain for the next month,\u2019 he says. \u2018The best thing to do is go away and never come back and remember it exactly as it is today.\u2019 Meanwhile, the winters are, well, monsters. Wet, wild and often dark by 3pm, with winds so strong that Steve shows me \u2018wool\u2019 \u2014 a sort of soft wooden fur on the outside walls of the cabin, made as the ferocious south-westerly gales erode the special reinforced Swiss timber. Even though he has spent years -living on Scottish islands, he wouldn\u2019t dream of dwelling here. \u2018Never,\u2019 he says. \u2018What would you do? What would anyone do?\u2019 Until about 20 years ago, sheep still grazed here. The Summer Isles are so named because, historically, shepherds used to pop their sheep on them for summer grazing. There are still the remains of a shepherd\u2019s hut on the north side of the island and, well, that\u2019s about it. To the south, the much bigger island of Tanera Mor \u2014 the inspiration for the cult 1973 horror film The Wicker Man \u2014 is a different kettle of fish. It was bought in 2017 by English hedge-fund mogul Ian Wace, who is turning it into an upscale retreat. It has already welcomed Prince William and Princess Kate and TV presenter Ben Fogle ashore as visitors, and Ian has further plans to expand. But Mullagrach has always been about preserving a bit more solitude than most of us would know what to do with. While Chris is sad to sell, he knows it is time \u2014 he has four adult children battling with property prices. Steve\u2019s theory is that Chris\u2019s wife was never quite as keen on it as he was \u2014 and I do note that there is just one toothbrush in the cabin. But Chris adores and respects the island \u2014 unlike some of Mullagrach\u2019s previous owners. Before Chris, a hotelier called Howard was bursting with grand plans. \u2018A six-bedroom house, a swimming pool!\u2019 says Steve. \u2018There\u2019s no bloody water here. He even got a water diviner in.\u2019 According to Steve, Howard barely spent two hours on the island during his ownership. \u2018Back then there was no landing frame so I\u2019d bring a ladder in the boat,\u2019 says Steve. \u2018And he was a very fat chap, so it wasn\u2019t easy and we never saw him again.\u2019 So back on the market it went. At one stage, it was the property of lawyer Ian Macdonald. He adored it and the mainland community adored him. But his family were less keen on the island. So, after he left it to them in his will on the understanding it would never be sold, it was on the market about 20 minutes later. Lord knows who will buy it now. Hopefully not another silly Howard full of ambitions as mad as they are bad. According to the agents, there has been a lot of interest, all from south of the border, or from abroad. But no viewings. \u2018We won\u2019t take anyone out there until they\u2019re pretty committed to buying it,\u2019 says Phiddy. \u2018Though there is a very detailed drone video.\u2019 Naturally, everyone in the mainland village of Achiltibuie likes to theorise on who will buy it. \u2018Hopefully someone who\u2019ll help in the community garden,\u2019 says one lady. The one thing they do agree on, everywhere I go \u2014 in the shop, down to the beach, in the very welcoming bar at the Summer Isles hotel \u2014 is how great Chris has been. \u2018He\u2019s proper. He\u2019s thoughtful. He\u2019s not like the others, who spend millions and only come every couple of years.\u2019 But perhaps, most of all, the buyer needs to be someone familiar with the vagaries of the Highlands \u2014 to know that it could rain and blow for weeks on end. That life folds up in the winter, and often in summer, too. That sometimes you just have to sit out a storm and have another whisky, or five, and just relax and revel in the sort of extreme solitude that most people can only dream of. But please, please, no one who wants to add it to their global property -portfolio and chopper in once a year just to try to spot the Northern Lights. \u25a0 Click here to visit the Scotland home page for the latest news and sport", "summary": "There is something splendid about standing on top of the rugged, lichened, 89-acre kingdom of Mullagrach; tasting the salt on my lips from the sea spray, watching", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13581625/Yours-500-000-uninhabited-Scottish-isle-beautiful-teeming-wildlife-breath-away-problem-weathers-harsh-unpredictable-easy-marooned-days.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/28/21/86714157-0-image-m-14_1719607604923.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:32:24", "author": "Editor,Jane Fryer", "authors": ["Editor", "Jane Fryer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.105}

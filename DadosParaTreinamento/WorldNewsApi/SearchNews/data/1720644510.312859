During his meeting with the press, Conille\u2019s communications advisor gave an overview of the Prime Minister\u2019s activities since arriving in Haiti last weekend, following his appointment by the Transitional Presidential Council (CPT) to lead the transitional government. D\u00e9sauguste, a former journalist for Radio M\u00e9tropole, used the Creole proverb \u201cBourik chaje pa kanpe\u201d (In English, a loaded donkey can\u2019t stop) to emphasize the urgency with which the new Prime Minister is addressing Haiti\u2019s challenges and aiming to lead the nation toward peace, security and democratic restoration. \u201cUpon his arrival in the Haitian capital on June 1, Prime Minister Conille hit the ground running,\u201d D\u00e9sauguste told a small pool of reporters at the Prime Minister\u2019s official residence in Port-au-Prince. \u201cDr. Conille visited downtown Port-au-Prince and inspected shelter centers to assess the situation and living conditions of those displaced by armed gang conflicts,\u201d he added. Despite being engaged in cabinet formation consultations and negotiations, Conille took time to meet with high-ranking officials of the Haitian National Police (PNH) and Haiti\u2019s Armed Forces (FAd\u2019H) high command. He also met with representatives from Digicel and Natcom, the country\u2019s two major telecommunications operators, to discuss the security crisis\u2019 impact on their operations. Conille\u2019s optimism and obstacles Despite the challenges, D\u00e9sauguste expressed the Prime Minister\u2019s optimism and determination to collaborate with all sectors of the nation to address Haiti\u2019s multidimensional crisis. He reaffirmed Conille\u2019s commitment to forming an inclusive government that reflects the aspirations of the Haitian people, who have long suffered from insecurity, political instability and socio-economic crises. However, according to sources close to him who spoke on condition of anonymity to the Haitian Times on Thursday night, Conille has faced some significant hurdles. The Prime Minister has encountered resistance from the CPT over logistical details\u2014such as the missed formal installation that would give him the power to officially sign documents\u2014and his vision of staffing the government with technocrats rather than favoring cronies. According to the sources, Conille is considering consolidating the government\u2019s 18 ministries into a maximum of 13 and reducing the staff in each ministry\u2019s cabinet from the current 15 to a maximum of seven. Despite opposition from some CPT members who presented lists of job candidates, comprising mostly political allies, Conille insists on appointing at least three of his choices to top cabinet posts. Late on Thursday, local media outlets reported that CPT members agreed with Conille\u2019s proposal to reduce the number of ministries and cabinet personnel. However, negotiations over details were still ongoing on Friday. Despite rumors that the government would be installed by the end of the day, this did not happen. For the installation to occur, the CPT must first issue a decree naming the ministers, as they did for Conille. Sources from the CPT and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office have indicated that the details would be finalized by the beginning of next week, and the new government installation is scheduled for June 12.", "summary": "<figure><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jean-Jul-Desauguste-1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-rss-image-size size-rss-image-size wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jean-Jul-Desauguste-1-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jean-Jul-Desauguste-1-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jean-Jul-Desauguste-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jean-Jul-Desauguste-1-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jean-Jul-Desauguste-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jean-Jul-Desauguste-1-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1", "url": "https://haitiantimes.com/2024/06/08/conille-spokesperson-gives-first-press-conference/", "image": "https://haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jean-Jul-Desauguste-1-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:20:13", "author": "Arnold Junior Pierre,Guest Author", "authors": ["Arnold Junior Pierre", "Guest Author"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.052}

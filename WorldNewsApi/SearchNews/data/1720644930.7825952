{"id": 231298764, "title": "\u2018Queen of Clay\u2019 Iga Swiatek sweeps aside Jasmine Paolini to claim third straight French Open title", "text": "The world number one from Poland brushed aside Italian underdog Jasmine Paolini 6-2 6-1 in and hour and eight minutes. King of Clay Rafael Nadal may have played his last French Open this year but Swiatek comprehensively proved once again she is also Roland Garros royalty. She is the first woman to win three consecutive Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007 and only the third to achieve the feat in Open history, along with Monica Seles. Swiatek is undefeated in Paris since 2021, 21 matches ago, and has won 34 of her 36 matches here, a record matched only by Seles and Chris Evert. Such is her dominance there were even fears that Swiatek \u2013 who had already won one match 6-0 6-0 in 40 minutes this fortnight \u2013 could threaten the record for the fastest match of 32 minutes when Steffi Graf pulverised Natasha Zvereva by the same score in the 1988 final. After all Paolini, the 12th seed, had until this year never been past the second round at a grand slam. But the 28-year-old dispelled that notion when she survived a break point to hold in her first service game and then broke the world number one in the next. She was cheered on by a healthy Italian contingent including one noisy corner who formed a tricolour mosaic with their green, white and red t-shirts. But the bear had been poked and Paolini only won four more points in the next five games as Swiatek raced to the opening set. She had won 10 in a row before Paolini got on the board again, but Swiatek wrapped up her fifth grand slam title moments later and sunk to her knees in celebration.", "summary": "<p>Iga Swiatek swept to a fourth French Open crown to keep her \u2018Queen of Clay\u2019 title at Roland Garros.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/sport/womens-sport/queen-of-clay-iga-swiatek-sweeps-aside-jasmine-paolini-to-claim-third-straight-french-open-title/a1789345134.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/X2v00LX4XMpw64y5RyzXTAqW5nw=/0x0:5946x3964/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/c166d84f-3897-49d6-9914-0bef87735abc/fb83a6eb-a4a7-456e-9b20-bc70635fd6a3/c166d84f-3897-49d6-9914-0bef87735abc.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:17:01", "author": "Andy Sims", "authors": ["Andy Sims"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.123}

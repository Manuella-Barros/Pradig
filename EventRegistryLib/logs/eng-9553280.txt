The international format is getting an immersive gaming experience that will accompany the TV singing competition format.\n\nThe Voice owner ITV Studios is working with virtual gaming world The Sandbox on 'The Voice Coach Battle', which will allow players to act as celebrity coaches and sit in the show's famous red chairs. The Sandbox, part of Animoca Brands, has partnered with metaverse company Virtual Brand Group to launch the Web3 game.\n\nDeveloped off the back of the 155 adaptations of The Voice from around the world, Coach Battle will offer players a similar journey to real-life celebrity coaches on The Voice, starting with a blind audition. As the three contestants perform -- a tiger faced pop singer, a rebellious young female rocker and an intense, moody alien balladeer -- players hit the red button to select their artist. They then progress through the process, selecting music, wardrobe and stage lighting and offering their star advice at each stage. Additionally, players must complete quizzes on the TV show's real-life celebrity coaches.\n\nAlong the way, players are aided by four celebrity coaches designed for the platform -- Eon B. Rabbit, Kid Flaire, Cenalia, and IngoAmelis -- each of whom has their own musical backstory. The overall aim is to win the final Live Show by gaining a standing ovation.\n\nPlayers can also vote for their favorite contestants on NBC's Season 25 of The Voice, which is currently on air. Each week they will receive an exclusive NFT they use to cast a vote in The Sandbox, which allows TV brands to create metaverse worlds, and can win connected microphones so they can sing long at home.\n\nBy winning 'The Voice Coach Battle,' players will also get the chance to tickets to attend tapings of The Voice in the U.S.; France, where it runs on TF1; Germany (Sat.1), Australia (Nine Network) and the UK (ITV).\n\nWatch a video of the gameplay here\n\nJurian van der Meer, EVP Brand Licensing, Global Partnerships, ITV Studios said: \"In the wake of The Voice being named Franchise of the Year in K7 Media's 'Tracking the Giants 2023' report, alongside its recognition for boasting the highest number of active versions in 2023, our collaboration with The Sandbox to launch 'The Voice Coach Battle' represents an exciting step forward for our esteemed franchise.\"\n\n\"The Sandbox is a hub for creativity, discovery, and self-expression, naturally making it the perfect venue for The Voice. We are very excited to collaborate with them and bring the show's energy into the digital realm,\" said Arthur Madrid, CEO and co-founder of The Sandbox. \"We can't wait to see players truly shine as they take on the roles of their favorite coaches.\"\n\n\"It's showtime in the Sandbox. The future of entertainment is here now with new ways to unite and delight The Voice fans globally,\" said Justin W. Hochberg, CEO of Virtual Brand Group. \"Collaborating with ITV Studios and the Sandbox created a unique opportunity for VBG to merge the physical and digital worlds with three innovations: the first time global TV territories have united in one activation; first game experience on the platform with dynamic choices so every player decision creates a new outcome and television's first ever virtual coaches.\"\n\nCreated by John de Mol, The Voice is one of the most widely-travelled formats in the world. ITV Studios owns the rights through its acquisition of de Mol's Talpa Media in 2015.\n\nThe Sandbox is part of Animoca Brands, a digital entertainment group that runs several subsidiary companies.

Along with that, players from select countries can also win tickets to watch The Voice live.\n\nWell, The Voice is a hit show with a large fanbase, most of which certainly isn't well-acquainted with Web3 yet. Experiences like these in a blockchain metaverse like The Sandbox can drive a lot of visibility and attention towards Web3, and in particular, blockchain games.\n\nRegarding this collaboration, the CEO of Virtual Band Group, Justin W. Hochberg stated, \"The future of entertainment is here now with new ways to unite and delight The Voice fans globally.\"\n\nAt the same time, Arthur Madrid, the co-founder and CEO of The Sandbox also signaled his excitement, as he stated, \"The Sandbox is a hub for creativity, discovery, and self-expression, naturally making it the perfect venue for The Voice.\"\n\nThe goal of this experience is to put the players at the place of the coaches in The Voice, live. There's a shared pool of 15,000 SAND to be distributed among the participants who complete all the quests of this experience.\n\nParticipants can also vote and predict for performers advancements in the on-going season 25 of The Voice, and if their predictions come true, they will win an exclusive The Voice NFT.\n\nThose who complete the whole experience and fill out an online form will get the chance to win tickets to see The Voice live. However, this applies to select countries only.\n\nOverall, this is a good opportunity to players, and especially the fans of voice to put their enthusiasm to good use, and win amazing rewards.\n\nFirstly, you need only 18 EP to complete the event. Other than that, you need to complete all the quests in order to receive $SAND reward and the chance to win live tickets. At the same time, you will get a digital memorabilia only if you complete at least one quest.

The brand's virtual activations have ranged from dedicated, always-on metaverse experiences to sales of digital merchandise such as branded virtual hoodies and puffer jackets.\n\n\"Overall, our aim was to basically create deeper fan engagement with our audiences,\" said Leila Ahmed, a brand manager for The Voice owner ITV Studios. \"We know that there's a lot of people spending more time on these types of platforms, and for us, what was really imperative and important was to engage the connection with the fans and establish a way of how we can actually connect the TV show to these types of platforms.\"\n\nThe Voice's presence in the metaverse is not directly connected to NBC's hit \"The Voice\" television show, which is the American version of the international TV franchise. ITV Studios' expansion into metaverse platforms represents one way the company is looking to take advantage of its ownership of the broader The Voice brand without having to deal with regional partners such as NBC.\n\n\"If you wanted to make a TV show, you'd have to get permission from the network, right? This is now reverse engineering things, because ITV doesn't need to get permission from NBC -- they can go build it themselves on Roblox,\" said Justin Hochberg, the CEO of Virtual Brand Group, which partnered with The Voice to design and build the brand's virtual presence. \"So they have moved from being the supplier to the actual distributor.\"\n\nIndeed, as ITV Studios builds out its presence in the metaverse, it is looking to transform its virtual spaces from a marketing play into inventory that can be actively sold to sponsors and brand partners from across The Voice's international portfolio. So far, none of The Voice's sponsors have officially shown up inside any of its virtual experiences, but Ahmed said that conversations are underway, without naming names.\n\nThe Voice also views virtual merchandise as a promising revenue stream. Over the past year, the brand has partnered with Ready Player Me to design and sell virtual merchandise inside platforms such as HiberWorld, which sells a virtual The Voice hoodie for $1.99.\n\n\"They've been very receptive of that endeavor -- for games, it's basically a barrier breaker,\" said Ready Player Me head of strategic partnerships Stan Georgiev. \"Many developers find it very difficult to even get in touch with high-quality brands and IPs; it's a notorious struggle in the industry.\"\n\nAs virtual e-commerce becomes more widespread, The Voice could see downstream benefits from its position as an early mover in the space. After all, Roblox launched a pilot test of real-life commerce in partnership with Walmart last week, indicating that the platform has both the interest and technological know-how to implement virtual merch for brands such as The Voice.\n\n\"We're always looking to expand in that medium. I mean, we are a commercial team as well here, and we know that these platforms actually do have great revenue potential,\" Ahmed said. \"And we're basically now at the forefront of trialing this across multiple platforms.\"", "source": {"uri": "digiday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digiday"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexander_lee@digiday.com", "name": "Alexander Lee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Voice (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roblox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_Studios", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ITV Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sandbox game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minigame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minigame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hoodie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reverse engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media (communication)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/metaverse-creation-digiday.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553280", "eventUri": "eng-9553280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Israel has continued its brutal offensive on Gaza since a Hamas attack last Oct. 7 despite a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire. More than 36,700 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza, most of them women and children, and over 83,500 others injured, according to local health authorities. An Israeli warplane targeted on Friday the UN-run Asma School in the Al-Shati refugee camp, according to Palestinian Civil Defense spokesman Mahmoud Basal.

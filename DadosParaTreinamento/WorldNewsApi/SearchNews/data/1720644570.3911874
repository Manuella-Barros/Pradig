The post went viral with more than 688,000 views.Other Swifties took to the comments to share the admiration for Ravnik.\"Whoever he winked at, I hope they're still with us,\" replied @tashwilk.\"The Magic Jan show featuring Taylor Swift,\" added @robinettekelly.And @kgheener wrote: \"So nice of Taylor to play background music for me to fall in love.\"Newsweek contacted Ravnik by email for comment.At her Friday show in Scotland, Swift was greeted with a bagpipe performance of her hit song \"Love Story.\"The Reel Time Band, an 11-piece ensemble featuring eight highland bagpipers and three drummers, performed outside Edinburgh's Scottish Gas Murrayfield Stadium and wore traditional kilts for the performance.\"Taylor's tunes translate surprisingly well to traditional Scottish instruments. We're all huge music fans, so we're delighted to help welcome Taylor to Scotland in the best way we know how,\" said Roddy Deans, pipe major of The Reel Time Band.Another sweet gesture for the singer was that the stadium changed its sponsorship signage for her concerts from \"Scottish Gas\" to \"Scottish Lass.\" Swift revealed in 2015 that she has Scottish heritage.Even Edinburgh's local council paid tribute to the star, and on its website it had an advisory page called \"Edinburgh gets Taylored,\" for the thousands of fans pouring into the city for her concert.\"We are delighted that Taylor Swift has chosen to bring her tour to our city. We know she and all her loyal Swifties will enjoy true Scottish hospitality and receive a warm welcome to our capital city,\" the council wrote.Swift started her Eras Tour in March 2023, and has already performed across the U.S., and in Australia, Asia, Mexico, and South America, before arriving in Europe this summer. Ahead of hitting the halfway point of its 152 shows, the record-breaking production last year became the first ever tour to break the $1 billion barrier.", "summary": "Some fans even forgot they were at a Taylor Swift concert because they were so distracted.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/swifties-eras-tour-dancer-jan-1909999", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2406281/taylor-swift-eras-tour.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:40:44", "author": "Shannon Power", "authors": ["Shannon Power"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.429}

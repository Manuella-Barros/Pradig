{"id": 231252438, "title": "Prominent Israeli hostage Noa Argamani rescued on father\u2019s birthday", "text": "Argamani was one of the highest-profile hostages held by the terror group. Her traumatic kidnapping had been captured and released by Hamas on social media, and she was seen in subsequent Hamas propaganda videos. In the first video, taken by the terrorists who attacked Nova, Argamani and her partner Avinatan Or, were seen being dragged away by their captors. Argamani, her face contorted in panic, shouts \u201cNo, no!\u201d in Hebrew while being forced onto a motorbike, sandwiched between two gunmen. She reaches out for Or, whose hands are bound behind his back as a group of militants march him forward. She was later seen in a January video released by Hamas. In it, she says she was injured in her head and body by shrapnel and pleads for Israel to bring the hostages home. Her mother, Liora Argamani, is battling Stage 4 brain cancer and made a video plea in December to be reunited with her daughter. She says in the video, which was shared by Israel\u2019s government, that she\u2019s unsure how much time she has left. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I have left,\u201d Argamani said. \u201cI wish for the chance to see my Noa at home.\u201d", "summary": "Her traumatic kidnapping had been captured and released by Hamas on social media, and she was seen in subsequent Hamas propaganda videos", "url": "https://nationalpost.com/news/israeli-hostage-noa-argamani-rescued-on-fathers-birthday", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/nationalpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/noa-argamani.jpg", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/BVrHz9rn-SZnIQkEn.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:38:42", "author": "National Post Staff", "authors": ["National Post Staff"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.037}

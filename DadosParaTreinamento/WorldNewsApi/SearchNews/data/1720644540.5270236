Adhyayan, who had a public fallout with Kangana, commented on the incident an event in Mumbai. Recently seen in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Heeramandi, Adhyayan said that taking the law into one's hands, no matter how triggered one is, is not the solution. According to Hindustan Times, the actor's father, Shekhar Suman, also condemned the attack. Shekhar said, \"Yeh galat hai. It was very wrong and unfortunate. This shouldn't happen with anyone. No one has the right to do this. This is illegal what she has done. She should get punished for this. I understand that she might have some anger or protest in her mind, but the way it was expressed was very wrong. It could also have been said in a decent manner.You can't raise your hand on anyone like this.\" The now-suspended CISF constable was caught on camera after the incident, making it known that she was triggered by incendiary comments that Kangana had made about the farmers' protests some years ago. Reacting this father's statement, Adhyayan added, \"I completely agree with him. Even if you have a personal grudge, it is very wrong to take it out publicly. This should not have happened.\" Watch: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) Interestingly, Adhyayan Suman had previously publicly accused Kangana of slapping him at Hrithik Roshan's birthday party. In a revealing interview to DNA, Adhyayan had claimed in 2016 how Kangana had gotten \"violent\" with him. \"One moment she made me feel loved and then in the next, it was like I was a nobody in her life! I was standing at the bar alone when Kangana walked up to me said some actor at the party was trying to grab her a**. I felt protective towards her, but I was at someone\u2019s house, and creating a scene would be rude, so I told her, \u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019 She went back to doing her thing. Later, she came and told me let\u2019s go right now. I was walking down the stairs with her, when she turned around and slapped me! She said, 'Motherfu***! You are f***** jealous of my success!' The intensity of the slap was so hard I was almost crying. That was the first time she got violent,\" Adhyayan had revealed. The Punjab Police on Friday booked and suspended the CISF constable Kulwinder Kaur, a day after she allegedly assaulted Kangana at the Chandigarh airport. While many came out voicing their displeasure over the incident, Kangana took to social media to slam those celebrating the attack. Based on a complaint lodged by the CISF, the Mohali police had registered an FIR against Kulwinder Kaur under Sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/adhyayan-suman-condemns-kangana-ranaut-slap-cisf-9380075/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/MixCollage-08-Jun-2024-05-29-PM-263.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:28:27", "author": "Entertainment Desk", "authors": ["Entertainment Desk"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.32}

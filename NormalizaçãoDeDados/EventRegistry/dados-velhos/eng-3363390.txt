Nevertheless, the sporty intentions of the compact, along with its asymmetrical door layout meant it grabbed our attention, paving the way for a successful second generation. 22 photosWell, we are now looking at the freshest spyshots of the 2019 Veloster N, with this range-topper set to demonstrate the abilities of the carmaker's still-young N performance division.\n\nThe new Veloster will be a global car, marking the first-ever N product to be present in American showrooms. Speaking of which, the South Korean automaker is also working on the i30 N, which probably won't make it to the US.\n\nCompared to the spy material we've shown you in the past, the pics in the gallery above show the hot compact with less camouflage. This means we can get a better idea on the details we'll get to meet in the showrooms, from the headlights to the generous front grille.\n\nThere's one particular details of the prototype that leaves us in doubt, namely its ride height - the ground clearance seems to be higher than expected, as if this were an AWD hot hatch, which shouldn't be the case.\n\nInstead, the company is expected to bring us one of the best FWD chassis setups the segment has seen. The responsibility for the effervescent handling that should be offered by the Veloster N belongs to Albert Biermann. We're talking about the former BMW M Division star, who now helms Hyundai's N arm.\n\nAs for the firepower, the N incarnation of the Veloster is expected to deliver the punch the now-old Veloster Turbo never had, packing a 2.0-liter turbo-four with around 275 ponies.\n\nThe executive has even dropped a hint about the character of the Veloster N, stating that it will mix the kind of assets required for successful track days with daily driver features\n\nExpect the 2019 Hyundai Veloster N to land next year model and we should get plenty of opportunities to get under its skin by then. 2019 hyundai veloster n Hyundai Hyundai Veloster spyshots nurburgring 2017 Nurburgring Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

And when the Nurburgring is thrown into the story, the infamous corner wearing this nickname takes the place of the said park. But what if told you that there are also another kind of Ring adventures that qualify for the merry-go-round label? 5 photosLet's take the Porsche Cayman GT4 in the piece of footage at the bottom of the page, for instance. The 911 Carrera S (we're talking 991.1 matters here) engine and the 911 GT3 suspension mean that the GT4 is an ideal track toy - we must also factor in the splendid handling balance delivered by the mid-engined layout of this Porscha.\n\nSure, the manual tranny of the GT4 might not be the best friend of the stopwatch, but we're talking about track thrills, not numbers here.\n\nHowever, even such a winning combination can be difficult to handle when dealing with the caprices of the Nordschleife. And, by that, we're referring to the ever-changing weather at the Green Hell.\n\nIn the case of the Zuffenhausen lap we have here, the track was being assaulted by heavy rain, with the adventure leading to a tata-a-queue.\n\nThe shenanigan took pace in the Bergwek section of the track, having been caught on the dash cam of the vehicle following the German sportscar.\n\nAnd, thanks to the atmospheric aural delights of the 385 hp Cayman, we can clearly notice the moment when the driver gets back on the gas. The mid-corner maneuver was apparently executed to brutally for the condition of the track - of course, the tires play an extremely important role in such scenarios, but we're not aware of the rubber details surrounding this Porscha.\n\nOnce the GT4 driver noticed the hefty slip angle reached by the car, he decided to pull the plug, hitting the brakes and thus amplifying the slide - given the moderate velocity of the car, this was a safer choice than trying to bring the posterior back in line by giving the car some gas, which could've led to an overcorrection and possibly a crash.\n\nPorsche Cayman GT4 Porsche Nurburgring nurburgring 2017 Spare The Tires: Why Most New Cars Are Not Built For Road Trips Car Repairs - These Are The Cheapest Things That May Go Wrong on An Automobile Age of Enlightenment With a Mazda MX-5 RF on The Transfagarasan Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

Instead, these battles were a Middle Age reality, often seeing unarmed tough guys battling trained animals. Oh and this is also the first thing that came to mind when checking out the road rage incident we're here to show you. 8 photosSince we're talking about a Mercedes-AMG G63 and a first-generation Mercedes-Benz ML, we obviously saw the first as being the bear and the latter playing the role of the human. However, such assumptions might've been wrong.\n\nTruth be told, we have no idea what led to the confrontation between the drivers of the two offroaders. Heck, this could always be some sort of new-age wedding convoy tradition - given the expensive metal seen in the videos, one could expect this to be a pack of machines attending a wedding.\n\nHowever, we can be certain of one thing: the driver of the ML wanted to prevent the guys in the G63 from doing fulfilling their transportation wishes. Which led to the two offroaders crashing on multiple occasions, in a match like we had never seen before.\n\nIn theory, the G-Class should have a massive advantage in such a fight. We'll start with the obvious firepower asset, given by the twin-turbo V8 Affalterbach monster lying under the hood.\n\nThen we have the other uber-solid tech details of the G-Class, such as its recirculating ball steering, which is considerably more shock-resistant than the rack and pinion setup of the ML.\n\nHeck, the G63 even has three manually lockable diffs the guy behind the wheel can rely on when it comes to getting out of trouble, even though the asphalt scenario seen here means that the driver probably didn't touch the little buttons controlling the said diffs.\n\nIn real life, though, things weren't all that simple.

He managed to escape death, though not without injury. The TV presenter managed to crawl out of the car by himself but suffered a serious injury to his knee.\n\nHammond posted almost constant updates of how the Swiss insurgents were going to hold his bones with screws and what he'd done to his mobility chair. But now, eight weeks later, he's back behind the wheel, and in record time we might add.\n\nIn the clip shown on DriveTribe captioned: \"Today I took my first drive since my recent visit to Shuntsville\" Hammond can be seen enjoying his classic Ford Mustang GT. The presenter's love for classic American muscle cars is well known. Hammond even went as far as to say that he pities the people who don't understand their appeal.\n\n\"This feels better than the first time, being 17 and given the keys to freedom because this time, I'm ready. This is beautiful, thank you, doctors, thank you. I shouldn't even be sharing this moment; it feels too personal right now ... I mean I'm dressed, but I feel like I'm not,\" Hammond states.\n\nDuring his time on Top Gear, Hammond suffered another famous crash, back in 2006. It left him in a coma that lasted two weeks and with brain injuries.\n\nUnfortunately, things aren't going that smoothly for the new Amazon Prime show, as Jeremy Clarkson is now the sick one. Earlier this month, the 57-year-old was admitted to hospital with a bad case of pneumonia. This forced him to take an indefinite leave from work. A couple of titanium screws and a cast won't fix a lifestyle of smoking, unfortunately.

But we still remember how the actor was holding the steering wheel of the Lincoln MKZ. 31 photosIt's forever engraved in our minds and defines the way we see Lincoln's sedan. Don't get us wrong - it's a perfectly acceptable car that the IIHS likes. It's just... too Ford and not German enough.\n\nAnd because of its family lineage, you're unlikely to see somebody buying one and making massive mods. But this one has air suspension which hunkers the body down onto the dark red colored 20-inch Vossen CG-series wheels.\n\nThese changes draw attention back to the excellent Lincoln design, with conjoined taillights, bold creases, and LEDs. If you're into lowriders, this one deserves your attention. No matter what kind of lawyer you are, you will appreciate the fact that the MKZ was the first Lincoln to feature the Jaguar-like chrome grille design. This could be the reason people keep confusing it with the all-new Continental.\n\nThe MKZ is also one of the few cars that ditched its original capacitive switches for the traditional buttons and knobs that people actually wanted. There's also a 20-speaker system by Revel, SYNC 3 and real aluminum trim.\n\nThe middle-management cousin of the Ford Fusion isn't too shabby. It can cost anywhere from $35,000 for the 2-liter turbo model to over $47,000 for a Hybrid Black Label. Then again, the one that deserves everyone's respect is a 400 horsepower 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 with all-wheel drive that's cheaper than your basic BMW 5 Series ($43,575 including destination).\n\nWe really want to imagine that our Vossen-shod project car is the V6 and has been fitted with the Driver's Package. Why? Because it gives you access to a Focus RS-derived torque-vectoring rear differential. If you don't have AWD, the MKZ is going to be limited to around 350 horsepower to mitigate the effects of torque-steer.

We pay our taxes like the good citizens we are, and then the government goes and screws everything up. In our best interest, of course.\n\nLast year, pictures of an LAPD-branded Tesla Model S surfaced online, and the word was that the department was considering the acquisition of an EV fleet. A few weeks later the information came through that the police department had decided on a bunch of cheaper BMW i3s, which it got at a discount.\n\nWhile that might appears sensible of them, whether buying a low-performance electric vehicle was a good idea at the time is still debatable. However, with air pollution a growing problem in all major cities around the world, switching to vehicles with zero tailpipe emissions is always timely.\n\nThe Model S was eventually overlooked (apart from two P85Ds) due to the high cost, but Tesla's performance luxury sedan is making a comeback in other parts of the world. The EV has been chosen by the Luxembourg police to act as a patrol car, but there's one very important reason why this makes a lot more sense there than in any other place.\n\nIf you paid any attention during your Geography class when talking about mini-states, you'd know Luxembourg was one of them. So, with 82 km (51 miles) in length and 57 km (35 miles) in width, the usual range limitations of an EV become irrelevant.\n\nThe decision came as part of the government's decision to have ten percent of the new vehicles entering the state's official fleets use either electric or hybrid powertrains. The Teslas will cost \u20ac100,000 each, RTL says, and will act as some sort of a pilot project. If everything goes well, the Luxembourg police might receive more electric vehicles in the future, with two more already in the cards.

We don't know about that, but it's certainly a highlight of its era regarding driver enjoyment. 6 photosKeeping one on the road and in perfect condition is a difficult task. However, a few tasteful mods can be made without ruining its value, like adding the right aftermarket exhaust.\n\nYou can't buy an original mint exhaust for this car, but Milltek Classic offers an array of muffler for this and other European icons, such as the Audi Ur Quattro, the VW Corrado VR6, several versions of the early Golf GTI and the E36 BMW 325i, 328i or M3.\n\nThis is a labor of love. Milltek bought their own 1.9-liter 208 GTi back in 2014 and did everything it could to bring the Gallic hatchback back to mint condition. Sourcing all the trim pieces must have been hard.\n\nBut now that it's fully restored, the 205 is free to flaunt its new stainless steel system and also show the benefits of the upgrades. These include increased resilience to the weather, lighter weight compared to the original, better sound and design.\n\nHowever, Milltek Classic always tries to keep the aesthetics within the realms of what would have been fitted to the car when it left the factory. That's why this look is called \"OEM+.\"\n\nThe construction is pretty straightforward - just a downpipe from the engine, a muffler (no catalytic converter) and the trim piece at the end. Installation is equally simple.\n\nThe 205 GTI really owes its existence to a diesel engine. Peugeot made one for the 405 and wanted to install one in the smaller hatchback. Unfortunately, it didn't really fit, but it meant that the car had a wide engine bay. Peugeot Sport developed an aluminum 1.6-liter mill, and it's this unit that eventually powered the hero car. Later, a 1.9-liter with about 15 horsepower more was introduced.\n\nMilltek exhaust Peugeot 205 GTI Peugeot Why the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon Is Late to the Party Ten Cheap Car Hacks That May Help You Deal With Day-To-Day Issues From Wrecks and Rust to Riches: A Story of Passion and Business Spare The Tires: Why Most New Cars Are Not Built For Road Trips Car Repairs - These Are The Cheapest Things That May Go Wrong on An Automobile Production Cars with the Highest Torque Numbers For 2017 On Electric Harleys and New Generations Five Signs You Need To Take Your Car To Get Serviced 2017 Sinaia Concours d'Elegance: A 77-Year Disappearance An Ode to Embracing the Metric System Travel Checklist & Tips For a Long Car Journey The Biggest Anticipations in Motorcycling for 2016, Part 1 Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

As Volkswagen's finances began to struggle after the Dieselgate scandal, it looked it several such projects would never see the light of day. But now the Germans are up to their old trucks and German media says the Taigun has once again been approved for development.\n\nAccording to this video by Auto Bild, the name is subject to change. Instead of Taigun, it will be called the T-Rack, following the lead set by the T-Cross and T-Roc.\n\nThe reason for Volkswagen's change of heart is continued growth from other manufacturers in this segment. Renault-Nissan, who is now the biggest automaker in the world, has the Kwid, which has just been launched in Latin America. There's also the Honda HR-V. Meanwhile, the cut-price Ford EcoSport is taking over in Europe and even America.\n\nThe delay of the Taigun project could end up hurting VW, though, as this new model won't be ready sooner than 2020. It's rumored to be based on the successor to the current Up!, which VW might develop without Skoda and SEAT. The 3.8-meter crossover should be powered exclusively by the 1.0 MPI and 1.0 TSI 3-cylinder engines sending the grunt to the front wheels.\n\nOf course, styling will be revised, and as you can see Auto Bild has rendered something that looks a little bit like the T-Roc. Tapered headlights and chunky off-roader cladding will help the smallest Volkswagen soft-roader sell. However, it's yet unclear if or when it will be sold in Europe, while North America is strictly out of the question.\n\nVolkswagen Taigun Volkswagen Taigun Volkswagen T-Track Up SUV An Ode to Embracing the Metric System Travel Checklist & Tips For a Long Car Journey Modern Car Technologies That Aren't So Modern Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars The Dos and Don'ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part One The Biggest Anticipations in Motorcycling for 2016, Part 1 Why the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon Is Late to the Party BMW TwinPower Turbo Engines Explained Headwave TAG Helmet Music and Navigation System Reviewed Spare The Tires: Why Most New Cars Are Not Built For Road Trips Ten Cheap Car Hacks That May Help You Deal With Day-To-Day Issues 2017 Sinaia Concours d'Elegance: A 77-Year Disappearance Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

The German super-mobile is more than just a pretty body on wheels - it also has a story. It was built by its creator, Eberhard Schulz, who worked as a design engineer for Mercedes-Benz and helped with the creation of the stunning CW311 concept car.\n\nSince the Stuttgart-based company had no interest in sending the unusual model into production, Schulz asked for permission to build it himself. Permission was granted, and this is how the Isdera Imperator 108i came to be, borrowing some AMG V8 engines in the process as well.\n\nThe Isdera has an unusual shape, to say the least, resembling an Italian supercar much more than anything with German blood in it. Well, that might not be entirely true since the overall shape might remind some WWII experts of the Jagdpanzer 38 'Hetzer' German tank destroyer. Take away the gun, replace the tracks with four wheels, add some glass and there you have it: the Isdera Imperator 108i.\n\nAll jokes aside, seeing this vehicle in person truly is a one in a lifetime opportunity, especially if it's lapping the Nurburgring. Thirty of them were ever produced, but nobody knows how many are still un working order. The fiberglass body means it has nothing to fear from rust, but the tubular steel spaceframe isn't as safe. However, it does contribute to the car's exceptionally low overall weight of 1,350 kg (2,976 lb).\n\nThe Isdera used a number of AMG engines over the years, with no fewer than four different units slotting behind those two seats during the almost ten years it was in production. And just in case you're wondering why is that air scoop on the roof facing the wrong way, it's because it serves an entirely different purpose: it's a rear-view periscope. Yes, really.\n\nisdera imperator 108i isdera imperator exotic supercar Nurburgring Mercedes-AMG Mercedes-Benz mercedes-benz cw311 concept Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars Travel Checklist & Tips For a Long Car Journey From Wrecks and Rust to Riches: A Story of Passion and Business Why the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon Is Late to the Party The Dos and Don'ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part One Production Cars with the Highest Torque Numbers For 2017 On Electric Harleys and New Generations Ten Cheap Car Hacks That May Help You Deal With Day-To-Day Issues The Biggest Anticipations in Motorcycling for 2016, Part 1 An Ode to Embracing the Metric System BMW TwinPower Turbo Engines Explained Headwave TAG Helmet Music and Navigation System Reviewed Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

While we can hear the Benz torturing its tires in an attempt to go for one Nordschleife corner to another as briefly as possible, the Chevy passes the Merc without even trying.\n\nThe supercharged soundtrack of the beast is obvious, but we can't say the same thing about its source. While certain rumors tell us to expect a pumped-up incarnation of the Z06's LT4 motor, this hypothesis isn't without its complications. For instance, the heat soak discussions revolving around the Z06 mean that GM engineers would have to seriously up the ante on the cooling front.\n\nOther aficionados expect the new ZR1 to pack an all-new 6.2-liter DOHC V8 wearing the LT5 moniker. However, there are voices claiming that the all-new engine is too wide for the nose of the C7 and will make its debut, in naturally aspirated form, on the mid-engined C8 Corvette (here are the most recent spyshots of the C8).\n\nRegardless of its firepower, we're expecting the new ZR1 to lap the Ring in under seven minutes. In fact, we could even the extreme 'Vette stealing the Lamborghini Huracan Performante's Nurburgring glory, which would mean the slab of America can get round the track in under 6:52.\n\nUntil we get our hands on the numbers revolving around the 2018 Chevrolet Corvette, we're inviting you to listen to the thing bouncing off the rev limited in the clip below.\n\n2018 chevrolet corvette zr1 Chevrolet Corvette Chevrolet supercar Nurburgring spy video Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

That makes the Frankfurt Motor Show Europe's number one automotive event of the year. 25 photosWell, there isn't a clear hierarchy and some might not agree, but anyone who has attended all three major European events (Geneva, Frankfurt, and Paris) can at least attest to the fact it is by far the largest. Getting from one end of the show to another is serious workout unless you use some of the shuttle services provided.\n\nApart from the actual distance, it's also the large attendance that gets in the way, so for that reason alone, you would expect carmakers to flock to such an event with their latest models or even world premieres. Instead, no fewer than nine of the big industry names have chosen to sit out of this year's edition.\n\nThe entire FCA European contingent will miss it - Alfa Romeo, Fiat, and Jeep - despite the fact the former is keen on pushing its Giulia sedan and the Stelvio SUV, particularly against their German counterparts. Jeep, on the other hand, has been on the rise in Europe lately with models such as the Renegade selling particularly well.\n\nCitroen, Peugeot, and DS make up the French group that decided against turning up, but since they don't really have anything new of importance to show and French models aren't extremely popular in Germany, maybe their decision makes a bit more sense.\n\nFinally, the Japanese from Nissan, Infiniti, and Mitsubishi bring the total number to nine, with Nissan's decision being the most surprizing as it would have been the perfect venue for the European launch of its second-gen LEAF electric hatchback.\n\nLooking for the Volvo stand will also prove futile as the Swedes stay true to their decision to drop out of large shows and focus on smaller events to launch their new models or concepts. That's actually a trend across the entire industry, but at the moment most brands choose to mix the two.\n\nDespite the thinner than usual lineup, the Frankfurt Motor Show promises to bring plenty of novelties, especially for those interested to see how the EV plans of the big German brands are likely to unfold. Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz all intend to show close to production concepts of their upcoming electric cars or SUVs.

Why? Because the official debut is right around the corner: August 23rd. 7 photosWe're not sure that the T-Roc will significantly change the small crossover segment. But because it's a Volkswagen, so it should sell well.\n\nThey've done a pretty good job with the design as well. This is easily one of the Top 3 most overstyled cars in the segment, right up there with the Juke. The emphasis is clearly placed on looking as modern as possible, less on the outdoorsy aspect.\n\nSo, for example, the T-Roc's taillights are defined by a sharp crease that continues into the trunk lid spoiler. They have a strong 3D presence, just like on the Tiguan. The headlights, meanwhile, use the familiar double LED projectors seen on everything from the Golf facelift to the Arteon.\n\nIt's also kept a few elements from the concept car, like the LED halo lights around the fake air intakes. Inside, the T-Roc is a carbon copy of the new Polo, with which it shares its MQB A0 platform. There's body-matching yellow trim on the dash, a new infotainment system, and the 10-inch digital dashboard option.\n\nThe T-Roc is the second crossover based on this platform and the fourth car overall. It will measure 4,231mm in length, so about the size of a Golf, while its overall height is 100mm more than a Polo. While you won't be able to do any off-roading in this crossover, it will at least have 400 liters of useful trunk space.\n\nThe Audi Q2 from another mother will be powered by both 3- and 4-cylinder turbo engines. The smallest will be a 1-liter unit pushing 95 HP. At launch, the range should stop at 150 HP, but a T-Roc R with over 200 HP is being considered.\n\n2018 Volkswagen T-Roc crossover Volkswagen T-Roc crossover An Ode to Embracing the Metric System The Dos and Don'ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part One Headwave TAG Helmet Music and Navigation System Reviewed Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars The Dos and Don'ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part Two (Final) Modern Car Technologies That Aren't So Modern On Electric Harleys and New Generations Travel Checklist & Tips For a Long Car Journey 2017 Sinaia Concours d'Elegance: A 77-Year Disappearance Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

But contrary to your expectations, German adventure accessory company Touratech appears to be heading down the bankruptcy road. 6 photosThe bad news surfaced last Friday in Germany with the hugely popular motorcycle accessory manufacturer based in Niedereschach filing for insolvency and with the company's press officer, Mr. Ingo Schorlemmer, making it public.\n\nThe announcement tells that Touratech employees were informed by both the insolvency administrator and the executive board about the bad news. However, wages and salaries have been paid, and the initial phase of insolvency will be used to gain an overview of the economic situation of the company and to examine restructuring options.\n\nFunnily enough, it is the adventure market growth and its demand that pushed the company into filing for bankruptcy. How is that possible, you ask?\n\nWell, increased demand meant Touratech had to implement a new logistics center but for some reasons (probably being busy printing those 400+ page full-color catalogs) it delayed this operation which led to logistics and production issues. These, in turn, generated production and supply losses which ultimately led to the company's insolvency.\n\nFor now, you shouldn't worry too much as most Touratech distributors have announced they will continue business as usual and keep selling the company's products until further notice.\n\nTouratech AG was founded in 1990 by Herbert Schwarz and Jochen Schanz from the experiences gained by the two from many motorcycle trips around the world. From its humble beginnings around a coffee table, the company has grown over the years to become one of the world leaders in this sector today.\n\nThe company offers specific accessories for more than 42 motorcycle models along with helmets and complete moto clothing lines. Touratech equipped famous Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman in their epic adventure around the world. Also, globetrotters Michael Martin and Joe Pichler used its products among others.

There are multiple aspects you need to consider, some of which might be tricky to reconcile.\n\nApart from the enviable position, Christina Schulze F\u00f6cking, the Christian Democratic Union member who took over the North Rhine-Westphalia Environment Ministry from Green Party's Johannes Remmel almost two months ago also inherited her predecessor's wheels.\n\nLast year, Remmel bought a Tesla Model S 90D as the Minister's official car on the basis that it was the only electric vehicle available that offered the needed range to cover the needs of someone in this position. Of course, the decision was met with criticism by some, arguing that spending over $100,000 on a vehicle wasn't exactly a wise investment. And by some, we also mean the current Minister, Mrs. Christina Schulze F\u00f6cking (then in the opposition).\n\nTwo months into her tenure, the new Minister has already purchased a new car, arguing that the 300 kilometers (186 miles) of range offered by the Tesla were not enough to cover the long distances in the North Rhine-Westphalia. To mitigate this issue, Electrek claims she ordered the acquisition of a Mercedes-Benz S500e hybrid, a car that mostly relies on its 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine running on gasoline while costing the same or more.\n\nWas it a move meant to discourage Tesla's presence in Germany and EVs in general? Was it another case of the authorities buying local (and since Germany has no decent electric vehicles...)? Was it just that the new Minister wanted to ride in the excellent comfort offered by the S-Class? Well, unless you feel like talking to a German politician, it's up for you to decide, because this is all that a spokesperson had to say on the matter (via Bild and Google Translate): \"The maximum range was in the long-range tests, depending on driving style and route profile, under 300 kilometers. This range could only be exhausted if it was then ensured that the batteries could be charged. This made it considerably more difficult to plan rides.\" Tesla Model S mercedes-benz s500e Hybrid Germany Politician Spare The Tires: Why Most New Cars Are Not Built For Road Trips The Dos and Don'ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part One Age of Enlightenment With a Mazda MX-5 RF on The Transfagarasan Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

Priced at $79.99, the neat-looking baby Macca toy will be available at global retailers by year's end.\n\nFor reference, the cheapest real-life 570S starts from $188,600 in the United States, whereas the Spider comes in at $208,000. The difference in pricing can be attributed to many things, especially the lack of an internal combustion engine furthered by two massive turbochargers.\n\nBut then again, the 570S push car is significantly more exciting for your toddler than simply taking a walk in the park with a conventional stroller.\n\nStep2 designed the child-oriented 570S with a storage area under the seat, which is perfect for stowing snacks. A couple of cup holders are also present. The patented Whisper Wheels, meanwhile, promise a smooth ride. Also standard are the flat-bottom steering wheel and electronic sounds.\n\nFor parents whose kids are more demanding, you're better off with the \u00a3375 ride-on P1. Electric by nature and benefitting from a top speed of 3 miles per hour, the kid-oriented P1 boasts dihedral doors, A/C, and even an MP3 player.\n\nIf I may turn the focus back on the Sport Series, McLaren won't stop here. After the Coupe, GT, and Spider, the entry-level model family will grow with a low-volume, high-performance derivative of the 570S. \"I think that a lighter, faster Sports Series has great appeal, although whether it would be an LT or not is another question,\" highlights Mike Flewitt, McLaren's head honcho.\n\nDon't know about you fellas, but I'm going to buy myself an $80 McLaren any day now.

The XF sedan has been more than decent, as has the recent F-Pace SUV, but Jaguar is obliged to have a sports model in its range as well, and the F-Type very aptly fills that gap. 22 photosThe little two-seater can be had with a two-liter four-cylinder turbo engine or a five-liter supercharged V8 unit, depending on the customer's liking - or, more likely, their wallet size. Most people will probably go for the option in between, which is a nice, three-liter supercharged V6 engine with anything up to 400 horsepower.\n\nHowever, those who want to feel the full extent of the sports cars' abilities, as well as hear the feline's best possible roar, will have to dig in for the R version, which uses the huge V8 for a total output of 550 horsepower. There's also the SVR model which adds 25 hp more, but that is only for the most hardcore fans of the brand since it costs more than any other sane person would ever spend on a Jag.\n\nThe marketing department of the company seems well aware of this as it too has chosen the F-Type R for its latest publicity clip. As you would expect, it does feature the occasional fast driving and loud exhaust notes, but this one is a bit more clever than that. It actually forced the team to do a bit of research first.\n\nIt seems that somewhere in Scotland, there's a little hamlet called Dull, with a population of 86. Meanwhile, in Oregon, U.S.A. there's another tiny settlement called Boring. Jaguar brought the F-Type to both these places to highlight the complete antithesis between the car and the town's names (and nature, apparently).\n\nYeah, sure, it's very fortunate that out of those 86 people living in Dull, two turned out to be a couple of young women who are very comfortable in front of the camera, but trust us: the video is so well done you won't care it's all an act. Just sit back and enjoy it. More like this, Jaguar, please.\n\nJaguar F-Type R Jaguar F-Type dull commercial video jaguar boring Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

Interestingly, it only took the orange Viper three passes to hit its target, with the Dodge pulling a 9.28s stunt at 162 mph.\n\nAs you can imagine, getting the thing off the line was the trickiest part of the job, so the component linking the steering wheel to the pedals was just as important as the tech upgrades fitted to the machine.\n\nWe have to explain that this Dodge Viper features the factory wheels, but its stock rubber was ditched in favor of Nitto 19-inch drag radials.\n\nThe tech massage featured on the beast cames from Vengeance Racing. And, as it often happens with such projects, any drag strip achievement only unlocks the path towards the next goal.\n\nTo be more precise, the crew is now looking to bring this Viper into the 8s arena. And we can only imagine how intense those shifts must feel...\n\nIn fact, here's the aftermarket specialist talking about its future plans for the contraption: \"We hope to go back out soon after some improved drivetrain upgrades and a bit better wheel/tire combination to push the car into the 8-second ET range while still shifting gears in the TR6060 transmission!\"\n\nAnd, thanks to the piece of footage below, you'll be able to check out the TT Viper doing its thing on the drag strip.\n\nDodge Viper Dodge twin-turbo drag racing V10 Why the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon Is Late to the Party The Dos and Don'ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part One Production Cars with the Highest Torque Numbers For 2017 Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars Ten Cheap Car Hacks That May Help You Deal With Day-To-Day Issues Age of Enlightenment With a Mazda MX-5 RF on The Transfagarasan Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

But we're not bothered at all since it reminds us of the boxy EP3 Type R built between 2001 and 2005. 7 photosFor almost a decade, that car remained the pinnacle of Honda hot hatch prowess, boasting a better power-to-weight ratio and superior suspension to its successor. However, that all changed when Honda went turbo.\n\nIt first started as a whisper, then came the official confirmation of three turbocharged engines: 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0-liter. Naturally, we think the unit in the middle would be a perfect fit for the Jazz Type R, partly because the Ford Focus ST now also uses a 1.5-liter turbo engine.\n\nWe're a little bothered by the smaller displacement, but we'd still be happy to see Honda entering the supermini hot hatch market and firmly believe there's some room left for them. The Polo GTI is too powerful and expensive; the Clio RS doesn't have a manual, and most other manufacturers seem not to get what we want.\n\nI mean, just look at what the Jazz/Fit Type R rendering is boasting: a big chin spoiler, flared wheel arches, bold side skirts and a large trunk wing. So what if the body looks like an MPV and some of the air intakes are fake! If it's cheap enough, people will buy it.\n\nBut what constitutes as cheap enough? Well, a Clio RS is about \u20ac24,000, but we want to see something getting dangerously close to \u20ac20,000 or about two-thirds of the price of the Civic Type R.\n\nDropping the Civic Si powertrain into this make-believe car would be the way to go - short-throw manual gearbox, grippy tires, lowered suspension and the in particular limited-slip differential.

The only problem is that it doesn't have an 8-speed automatic to go with it. According to Auto Guide, the German automaker has just filed a patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (on August 10th). The publication suggests that this new automatic will plug the gap between the old 7 G-Tonic and the new 9 G-Tronic that replaces it on some models. 11 photosIt's also suggested that the 8-speed would be used for sportier applications where the 9th gear isn't needed. But we don't agree with this notion. The new E63 S 4Matic+ uses a 9-speed and is pretty much the pinnacle of current AMG technology. So why would they make yet another gearbox for lesser cars when they could just use the 7-speed.\n\nThat's why we think the 8-speed is being trademarked in preparation for the arrival of all-new premium compacts. The A-Class would be the first to be unveiled, but that won't come to the U.S., at least not in hatchback form. But we recently saw the first prototype of the GLA II, and that one is a certainty.\n\nThe current roster of front-wheel drive Mercedes-Benz models uses a 7-speed dual-clutch which the company calls 7 G-DCT or 7-speed DCT, depending on the market. If we're right, the name change could signal a change to pure automatics with torque converters.\n\nThe move could work to their advantage in two ways simultaneously. First of all, American buyers often say that dual-clutch gearboxes are jerky off the line, so they would welcome smoother changes in their expensive Mercedes cars. Secondly, it might save some money.\n\nAs far as we know, the 7G-DCT is developed in-house and not shared with other brands except Infiniti and its Q30. But seemingly every automaker is now switching to an 8-speed automatic for front-driven cars that Japanese company Aisin assemblies. It's on a bunch of Volvo, MINIs and who knows what else. Even Volkswagen, the company best known for using two clutch packs per car, installed automatics in the Tiguan and Atlas models it sells in to Americans.

Nevertheless, with the exception of the King Kong example getting officially hooned at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, where the supercar made its debut, we haven't been able to enjoy too much GT2 RS hooning. 10 photosSo, here we are, making efforts to solve the said issue. To be more precise, we've brought along two pieces of Instagram footage that show us the rear-wheel-drive special putting its 700 ponies to good use.\n\nWe'll start with the first clip below, which demonstrates just how vicious the Rennsport Neunelfer can get during a take-off. We'll remind you that, despite the GT2 RS losing the all-wheel-drive aura of the Turbo S, the first can actually hit 60 mph quicker, needing just 2.7 seconds for the task - this is the official number and, since Zuffenhausen figures are always on the conservative side, we could expect even quicker starts.\n\nOh, and by the way, you should pay attention to the exhaust tips of the rear-engined animal, as the video allows you to check out the valves in action.\n\nPorsche pedants will notice the Weissach Package of the machine, which means this is 66 lbs (30 kg) lighter than the standard car, if we may call it so.\n\nThe same kind of aficionados will also tell you that this particular Neunelfer is dressed in Guards Red, which just happened to be the launch hue for the 991.2 Porsche 911 GT3.\n\nAs for the second piece of footage below, this takes us inside the car, showcasing the rolling start abilities of the machine. And yes, you should be prepared for much more serious GT2 RS action, since the drag racing videos will inevitably hit the web. Sure, the RS animal we have here is a circuit tamer, but don't expect this to prevent its drivers from engaging in straight line battles.\n\nYES! New 700hp 0-60 in 2.7sec GT2RS video launching. The new Ring King \u1f609 Volume up! Nice to have a video instead of all the pics floating around. Look close and you can see the exhaust flaps opening and closing.

According to the online automotive search engine research website, the findings of the Car Color Preferences by Gender Study come as a result of analyzing almost 700,000 consumer inquiries and roughly 30 million car sales. 7 photosThe study's highlights aren't all too surprizing, with women having a strong preference for teal automobiles (19 percent). Men, by comparison, prefer strong colors like yellow (33.9) and orange (32.6). And interestingly, the least liked colors are gray for women (2.7 percent) and beige for men (0.9).\n\n\"There's an interesting connection between gender preferences for vehicle colors and body styles. Men favor pickups and sports cars more than women do, and those segments have an unusually high percentage of brown and yellow/orange cars, respectively\" explained Phong Ly, the chief exec of iSeeCars. \"The same is true for some of women's favorite body styles - SUVs and minivans, which have more teal and gold cars than average,\" he added.\n\nOn the flip side, this difference in preferred colors means that men are more likely to spend extra on getting the car they want with the paint option they want. More to the point, the vehicles finished in the colors men prefer cost an average of $3,257 more than women's favorite car colors. Also, yellow cars analyzed in the study are 86 percent more expensive than teal vehicles.\n\nAnother study highlight comes in the form of red, the only color where male preference declined according to iSeeCars.com. By comparison, women have fallen out of love with four colors that had ranked in previous studies.\n\n\"Changes in color preferences could guide automakers to better market their vehicles to men and women,\" commented Phong Ly.

They're fairly different from what Europe and America have to offer, but they've managed to gather a substantial following all across the world. And with the 2020s closing in, enthusiasts expect the Japanese to debut an all-new breed of sports cars. According to Auto Bild, the 2017 Tokyo Motor Show is where we'll meet three of those fine-handling warriors. 16 photosFirst and foremost, the 2018 Toyota Supra is expected to make an appearance at the most important Japanese auto show of them all. Codenamed J29, the all-new Supra could very well show up in near-production form this coming October, chiefly because BMW paved the way to the G29 Z4 with the Roadster Concept at Pebble Beach. Don't expect the J29 Supra to get a stick shift, though, but come with the ZF 8HP automatic.\n\nUp next, the Auto Bild report suggests Nissan is developing a successor to the 370Z. From previous reports, Nissan let it slip that the 390Z isn't exactly a priority for the company's higher-ups. Also, bear in mind the carparazzzi haven't caught any Nissan mule or prototype resembling the 370Z.\n\nWith all due respect to the Z car faithful, it appears we'll have to wait a little bit more before Nissan presents a concept that'll preview the automaker's next-generation sports car. The waiting game shouldn't be too hard for us, especially because the 370Z is old, having made its debut 9 years ago.\n\nAnd finally, the German publication believes the Mazda stand will shine bright thanks to a \"series-based study of a new Wankel sports car.\" What Auto Bild refers to is the long-awaited, SkyActiv-R-powered RX-9 rotary sports car.\n\nChief executive officer Masamichi Kogai shot down the possibility of the RX-9 making it into production in the foreseeable future, claiming that the engineers need to make sure the rotary engine meets missions regulations. Be that as it may, this Mazda fan wouldn't say no to a version 2.0 of the RX-Vision Concept, the original being presented two years ago in Tokyo. 2017 Tokyo Motor Show Mazda RX-9 Nissan 390Z 2018 toyota supra Mazda Nissan Toyota On Electric Harleys and New Generations The Dos and Don'ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part Two (Final) The Biggest Anticipations in Motorcycling for 2016, Part 1 An Ode to Embracing the Metric System Five Signs You Need To Take Your Car To Get Serviced 2017 Sinaia Concours d'Elegance: A 77-Year Disappearance Why the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon Is Late to the Party Car Repairs - These Are The Cheapest Things That May Go Wrong on An Automobile Modern Car Technologies That Aren't So Modern Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

But the truth of the matter is, few higher-ups talk the talk and also walk the walk. Ralph Gilles is the exception, especially when FCA's design boss drives his Viper ACR like a pro on the racing circuit. 11 photosThe following 3-minute and 20-second video shows Ralph Gilles enjoying one of his favorite past-time activities, letting the V10-powered Dodge sing the song of its people on the 2.459-mile (3.957-km) Canadian Tire Motorsport Park near Toronto. On a closer look, the head of design of Fiat Chrysler can really drive despite the fact the ACR is an absolute monster on the track.\n\nFrom the cars he owns to his driving styling, it's easy to tell how much Ralph loves the automotive world. Speaking of which, The Straight Pipes reports the FCA official has a 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon coming, but \"he hasn't picked a color yet.\" This development is only natural, chiefly because the Viper has lost its halo car persona because of the 840-horsepower Demon.\n\nIn production since 2012, the fifth-gen Viper will stop production at the Conner Assembly Plant on August 31, 2017. The factory will be shut down permanently, with Fiat Chrysler refusing to comment on the possibility of getting the Detroit-based plant back in the game at some point in time.\n\nRegarding the demise of the Viper, the imminent discontinuation comes courtesy of the lack of curtain airbags. As it currently is, the front-engined supercar can't be fitted with curtain airbags, thus failing to comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard #226. All is not lost, however, with FCA chief Sergio Marchionne giving us a little bit of hope for what lies ahead.\n\nAccording to Marchionne, the architectural development within the company - a.k.a. Alfa Romeo's Giorgio platform - gives Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Dodge the \"possibility that a new version of the Viper may surface.\"\n\nralph gilles Dodge Viper track day Dodge supercar Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars BMW TwinPower Turbo Engines Explained 2017 Sinaia Concours d'Elegance: A 77-Year Disappearance Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

Well, if the latest unofficial McLaren talk turns out to be true, we should receive a similar, if not spicier driving experience in all-electric form. 11 photosWoking is said to be working on an EV supercar that would land in its Ultimate Series, as autocar writes, citing an insider.\n\nThe report states that the Brits will initially build only five units of the go-fast machine. The vehicles will land in the hands of high-ranked McLaren customers, who are expected to provide the vital feedback for the project.\n\nThis is pure speculation on our side, but YouTuber Mr. JWW, who seems to be more and more involved with the automaker, might just make it to the list.\n\nMcLaren Applied Technologies will deliver a new battery for Formula E cars starting next year, which will allow the challengers to complete a full race on a single race, replacing the current scheme, which sees drivers switching cars at the mid point of the race. So the technical expertise for an EV road car will be there.\n\nNevertheless, the Ultimate Series McLaren EV will land after the company hybridizes its Sports and Super Series, which means could see the electric model around 2022.\n\nTruth be told, the McLaren's business model makes Woking more suitable for the role of a big name on the velocity scene that provides an EV. It all has to do with the clientele - people who buy McLarens have always had a bit of an early adopter fetish, while Ferrari and Lamborghini buyers are more traditional.\n\nThis is probably why Maranello has warned us that we might have to wait a decade or even more before seeing the Prancing Horse logo on an electron juice sipper. Sant'Agata Bolognese might be more open to experimenting with all-electric power, but there's hasn't been any hint on the company working on such a vehicle. It seems like a fair assumption that we'll have to wait for Porsche to introduce the VW Group to the performance side of electric propulsion before seeing any other brand of the company going down this route.\n\nOf course, there are always smaller companies, such as Rimac, which is already working on its second low-volume model, a hypercar that will follow the Concept One. Another example of the sort is provided by NIO, the Chinese-based start-up whose EP1 has delivered a cool 6:45 Nurburgring lap time.\n\nAs such, now would be a good time to consider adding a charging station to your life.

Having been criticized for the lack of design boldness, the German automaker is determined to make the upcoming roadster as appealing as possible.\n\nOh, and you should also keep in mind that BMW is well aware of just how difficult it is to gain sales traction in this segment, which is yet another reason for which the showroom-ready Z4 will be a memorable appearance.\n\nSpeaking of the market introduction, the new BMW Z4 is expected to be dropped in March next year, at the Geneva Motor Show.

If you browse through the available boxes, you'll see there's a Chevrolet Corvette Z06, a Mercedes-AMG GT3, a Porsche 911 GT, and even a Ford F-150 Raptor pickup truck.\n\nHowever, what the collection is missing is one of the most iconic sports cars ever made: the Nissan GT-R. A mistake Lego will undoubtedly fix at some point, but something Firas Abu-Jaber wasn't going to wait for.\n\nYou see, Firas is a very talented Lego builder and also a fan of the Japanese model, so he combined the two and came up with this beauty. We've shown you the process that Lego designers use to create a new set when Craig Callum, one of the company's creative men, talked us through the birth of the Ford GT40 Speed Champions model.\n\nCompared to Firas' creations, those are small, simplistic replicas. Abu-Jaber has a much more thorough approach to his designs, which makes his work both easier and more complicated at the same time.\n\nIt's easier because the bigger the scale, the simpler it gets to reproduce the original shapes with the limited angles of the Lego bricks. But it's not all good news: a larger car also means that Firas needs to go into much greater detail, which he certainly does.\n\nOne look at this plastic Godzilla is enough to start a slow clap for the man's work. He chose a Nismo version of the Japanese legendary sports car, which means the exterior is white with red accents and a bit of black, particularly for the wing.\n\nThe real stunner is what he's done with the interior, where there are black and red seats, a dashboard complete with instrument cluster as well as a center console with satnav. Not impressed? How about a hood that opens to reveal a V6 turbo engine? No, it doesn't work, but we wouldn't really have been surprised if it did.

Starting from March 2018, the Euro-spec Civic will gain a turbo diesel in the form of an overhauled 1.6-liter i-DTEC, which promises to drink 3.7 liters per 100 kilometers. 8 photosTranslating to 76.3 mpg for the UK-spec model, the 2018 Honda Civic with the oil-chugging engine produces 99 grams of CO2 per kilometer under the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure. That's mighty impressive for a compact-sized model with plenty of torque at its disposal, as well as 120 PS (118 horsepower) on full song. Peak output comes in at 4,000 rpm, whereas the 300 Nm (221 lb-ft) of pulling force is delivered at 2,000 rpm.\n\nDifferences between the improved and the old 1.6 i-DTEC are small but plentiful, starting with pistons made from chromium-molybdenum steel alloy. The bores benefit from super plateau honing for smoother movement of the pistons, whereas the cylinder head port is of the high-swirl flavor. The all-aluminum block minimizes the engine's weight while improving NVH levels.\n\nThe 1.6 i-DTEC is augmented by a NOx Storage Converter system, comprising of large catalysts and a high content of noble metals. The silver, platinum, and neodymium integrated into the NSC are there to store nitrogen oxide until the soot sensor automatically triggers the regeneration cycle. Just like the Civic Hatchback, the turbo diesel powerplant is manufactured at Honda's plant in Swindon, UK. And of course, the sedan will also be available with the 1.6er.\n\n\"Wait a second, isn't the 2018 Honda Civic diesel less fuel efficient than the old one?\" You're right, but the difference has something to do with how gas mileage is measured in WLTP and NEDC testing. As a rule of thumb, WLTP uses real driving data. By comparison, NEDC is made up of lab-based tests. Thanks to the nature of WLTP testing, people like you and me have more chances of getting closer to the 2018 model's estimated fuel economy. 2018 Honda Civic 1.6 i-DTEC Honda Civic diesel Honda Europe UK An Ode to Embracing the Metric System Five Signs You Need To Take Your Car To Get Serviced Production Cars with the Highest Torque Numbers For 2017 Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

That's the sort of money Chevrolet asks for the Tahoe Custom, which is the second biggest news for the golden bowtie's full-size SUV for the model year 2018 after the 420-horsepower Tahoe RST. And so, what's the Custom all about? 8 photosTargeted at the customer who wants both capability and looks, with a dash of value in between, the Tahoe Custom comes standard with 6,600 pounds of towing capacity. With the optional trailering package, make that 8,600 pounds. There's also 112 cubic feet of cargo space, as well as the best-in-class 23 mpg highway offered by the 355-horsepower 5.3-liter V8.\n\nBuilt on the LS trim, the Custom brags with 18-inch aluminum wheels, all-season tires, chrome accents on the grille, and third-row seats delete. The latter is a choice Chevrolet made to free up space inside, thus increasing cargo capacity behind the second-row seats to 54 cubic feet. An 8.0-inch infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto come from the get-go, as does 4G LTE connectivity with Wi-Fi and a 110V three-prong outlet.\n\nRemote start, rear seat reminder, and active aero shutters are also on the menu, though four-wheel-drive is available as an option. To arrive at dealers in September 2017, the 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe Custom is equipped with a flurry of safety features. Forward Collision Alert, Low-Speed Forward Automatic Braking, and IntelliBeam headlamps with automatic high beams, however, are part of the optional Enhanced Driver Alert Package.\n\n\"In the past five years, the average transaction price for the segment has climbed fueled by customer appetite for features like heated and cooled seats, adaptive cruise control and a head-up display,\" declared Sandor Piszar, Chevrolet Trucks marketing director. If, however, the Tahoe isn't powerful enough for your needs, Dodge's Durango SRT certainly fits the bill. 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe Special Edition Chevrolet Tahoe SUV Chevrolet v8 Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars Ten Cheap Car Hacks That May Help You Deal With Day-To-Day Issues Modern Car Technologies That Aren't So Modern Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

Maintaining contact between the tires and the asphalt is crucial for safe driving, and we all know that everyday driving is all about safety.\n\nWhen you're behind the wheel of a 400 hp Audi RS3, however, you might feel like doing a bit of mischief. The super hot hatch from Ingolstadt has that quality of bringing out the hooligan in you - the one that wants to let the exhaust rip even though it's one a.m. and you're on a residential street.\n\nIt's not just the unusual amount of power for such a car available at your disposal, but also the handling. The new RS3 is improved in that respect, and coupled with the quattro four-wheel-drive system, that means you can have more fun than ever on the twisty bits.\n\nMat from Carwow is more than happy to demonstrate, and thanks to a GoPro stuck on his head, we get to experience it as well. The POV video starts with him climbing into the sports seats, but things quickly get a lot more interesting as Mat demonstrates the RS3's acceleration.\n\nComing off a series of bends to a sudden crest on the road, Mat finds the time to ask rhetorically whether he could get some air over the bump. The speedometer jumps from 83 mph to 125 mph in a fraction of a second as the wheels spin freely in the air while our host for the ride launches into a chain of expletives, followed by uncontrollable giggles.\n\nThe giggling doesn't stop soon, so Mat calls it a day and pulls over. He hides his excitement by talking a bit about the RS3's interior, but you can tell he's still high on the adrenaline rush from that jump. Sadly, a POV video on YouTube isn't going to have the same effect on its viewers, but it's still pretty damn cool to watch.

The rare phenomenon occurs when the Moon lines up perfectly with the Sun to block the latter from our view during the day. 4 photosIt used to scare ancient people senseless, and since it feels as though someone had turned the dimmer on the sun all the way down, if you have no idea what's going on, it's easy to imagine why. It must be extra puzzling for those who believe the Earth is flat, but we're sure they've come up with a pretty good explanation for it.\n\nWe might be a lot wiser on the causes of the eclipse, but our eyes are just as sensitive to the light as they've ever been. And since everybody will want to have a close look at the sun, extra precautions are necessary.\n\nPeople used to gaze at the phenomenon through pieces of smoked window, but while those might have done the trick for our ancestors, we're much pickier nowadays. We need somebody to offer us guarantees that our eyes will not suffer from the exposure, so we'll likely purchase some certified special glasses.\n\nVolvo is offering an alternative to that, but unfortunately, it's only available for the owners of the recently introduced 2018 XC60 SUV. The device is called the 'Panoramic Moonroof Eclipse Viewer' and, if anything, it's just a sheet of dark tinted plastic you place over your XC60's glass roof. Only this one uses ISO-certified 12312-2 material and comes with a magnetized frame to make sure you won't miss the eclipse as you're running to catch the Eclipse Viewer because of the wind.\n\nThe device will actually be made available to select Volvo dealers across the eclipse path - Oregon, Idaho, Nebraska, Missouri and South Carolina - but no price has been disclosed. The Swedish manufacturer claims all five occupants can take advantage of the Panoramic Moonroof Eclipse Viewer and watch the event in 'comfort and safety.'\n\nAs part of the company's \"Racing the Sun\" campaign, one Volvo XC60 SUV equipped with the special item will sit on the eclipse's totality path and stream high-quality (4K) live 360-degrees and VR footage for anyone tuning in to watch. volvo xc60 panoramic moonroof eclipse viewer Volvo XC60 racing the sun Eclipse Volvo load press release Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars Ten Cheap Car Hacks That May Help You Deal With Day-To-Day Issues Age of Enlightenment With a Mazda MX-5 RF on The Transfagarasan An Ode to Embracing the Metric System Travel Checklist & Tips For a Long Car Journey The Biggest Anticipations in Motorcycling for 2016, Part 1 Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

That's a lot of grunt to be headed only for those rear wheels.\n\nLuckily (and not at all accidentally), the Beast of the Green Hell also wears ridiculously wide 325/30 ZR 20 Michelin Sport Cup 2 tires to maximize the contact patch, but if you're heavy-footed, then there's nothing to keep the wheels from spinning freely.\n\nA bit of water on the asphalt has always been the perfect lubricant for a session of not-so-safe fun on the track, but when the car is driven by professional race drivers, it all turns into something resembling figure skating, only a hell of a lot more interesting.\n\nThe Mercedes-AMG GT R here is a 'Ring taxi, and it's probably giving the ride of a lifetime to some lucky guy with the money to spare. We can see the driver launch the GT R into soft oversteer in every possible turn as long as it deems it safe. When sandwiched between other cars, he chooses to keep the GT R balanced, put some distance between them and then resume the sliding.\n\nIt's not just the sheer beauty of the Mercedes-AMG GT R that catches the eye here or the elegance of the slides, but also the fact that drifting isn't something we get to see too often on the Nordschleife since it's not allowed. Still, when it's wet, who's to say whether you are drifting or merely suffering from a bit of 'unintentional' oversteer?\n\nmercedes-amg gt r mercedes-amg gt r nurburgring drifts Nurburgring Nordschleife Mercedes-AMG beast of the green hell An Ode to Embracing the Metric System Five Signs You Need To Take Your Car To Get Serviced The Biggest Anticipations in Motorcycling for 2016, Part 1 Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars Ten Cheap Car Hacks That May Help You Deal With Day-To-Day Issues Age of Enlightenment With a Mazda MX-5 RF on The Transfagarasan Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

We had our doubts about the project, but it looks like the two-seater's blood still flows fast and vigorous. 23 photosThe Z4 concept was supposed to be revealed at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance but has leaked online earlier than expected thanks to Bimmerfile. These photos are about as good as it's going to get and they paint a vivid picture of a sinful-looking piece of metal.\n\nThe front end styling is undeniably linked to the 8 Series Concept. We see a grille that points down, like the nose of a shark, followed by a gigantic air intake that dominates the fascia. Also unusual for BMW, the headlights aren't aligned with the front of the car, instead tapering towards the back in an Aston Martin-like way.\n\nThe back end features two silver pods, a trunk lid spoiler that hints at the old Z4 models and narrow taillights that almost touch in the middle. They didn't go too big with the badges either, unlike the Mercedes SLC-Class. The diffuser is made from carbon fiber, as you'd expect on a concept.\n\nThe interior is nifty too, but we can't help noticing that the Z4 test prototypes didn't look like this. While the current Z4 has top-to-bottom two-tone finishes, this one has left-to-right, signaling a more driver-focused design. The steering wheel is way cooler than anything BMW is ever going to put into production, while the console borrows just the right amount of buttons from other cars.\n\nEarly reports said only two engine versions would be offered, similar to the ones on the 330i and 340i. However, our spyshots showed a base s20i with a 6-speed manual and only 197 PS.\n\nAlso confusing is the data on the start of production. While a sticker on the dash of the s20i prototype said SoP is November 2018, newer reports state the Z4 will come alive by March of that year. But that could just be down to the cheaper base model being delayed. 2018 BMW Z4 G29 BMW Z4 BMW BMW Z4 concept Spare The Tires: Why Most New Cars Are Not Built For Road Trips Five Signs You Need To Take Your Car To Get Serviced Modern Car Technologies That Aren't So Modern Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles head of design Ralph Gilles was at the Conner Assembly Plant in Detroit to see the final Gen 5 supercars roll off the line. 6 photosThe penultimate model is a customer car finished in yellow and beautified with black stripes. As for the last Viper, it's a red brawler that will spend its life not on the road, but in the automaker's heritage collection. And this, I'm afraid, is where the story of America's ultimate supercar comes to an end.\n\nOr does it?\n\nWith Conner Assembly scheduled to close down for good, the pessimist crowd finds it hard to imagine there's a light at the end of the tunnel. But Fiat Chrysler chief executive officer Sergio Marchionne begs to differ. Only recently, the head honcho let it slip that Alfa Romeo's Giorgio platform could be the starting block for the all-new Viper. Then again, FCA refuses to comment on the matter officially, leaving us with nothing but hope.\n\nNow it would be best to take a trip down memory lane, to remember that the first-ever Viper saw the light of day in 1992. Known as Phase SR I, the first generation makes use of an odd-firing 8.0-liter V10. The massively powerful and torquey engine went on to serve the heavy-duty Ram pickup truck line, with the 8.3-liter variant following a little bit later in the Dodge Ram SRT-10.\n\nThe latest and the greatest Viper of them all, n\u00e9e Phase VX I, made its world premiere at the 2012 New York Auto Show. Arguably the most forward-thinking design of the 25-year-old series, the Gen 5 Viper relies on an 8.4-liter V10 with up to 645 horsepower and 600 pound-feet of torque. And just like all of its predecessors, it comes exclusively with a six-speed manual tranny.\n\nSo long... #Viper\n\nA post shared by @ralphgilles on Aug 16, 2017 at 6:38am PDT\n\n#TBT A#Viper\n\nA post shared by @ralphgilles on Aug 17, 2017 at 3:49am PDT\n\nDodge Viper Conner Assembly Plant Dodge production supercar An Ode to Embracing the Metric System Travel Checklist & Tips For a Long Car Journey Modern Car Technologies That Aren't So Modern Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars Ten Cheap Car Hacks That May Help You Deal With Day-To-Day Issues From Wrecks and Rust to Riches: A Story of Passion and Business Why the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon Is Late to the Party Car Repairs - These Are The Cheapest Things That May Go Wrong on An Automobile Production Cars with the Highest Torque Numbers For 2017 Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

However, the quadruple tailpipes aren't the production units, which should skip the rounded shape of the hardware found on the prototype for the traditionally trapezoidal layout of Mercedes-AMG monsters.\n\nWhile the all-LED headlights are now exposed, the front and the rear aprons remain camouflaged, with the German automaker being willing to keep the redesigned bumpers hidden. Nevertheless, we can be certain of one thing - those front apron air intakes will be overly generous.\n\nSince the Mercedes-AMG C63 Sedan is already one of the most potent cars in its class, we're not expecting the mid-cycle revamp to bring any major changes in the firepower department.\n\nAs such, the twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 occupying the engine compartment of the four-door model, which now delivers 476 hp or 510 ponies in S trim, should get a small muscle bump.

The body-on-frame construction makes it dependable, whereas the 4.6-liter Modular V8 is a tried-and-tested lump that's easy to service and reliable. It's no wonder, then, why the pursuit-rated Crown Vic was popular with law enforcement agencies. 11 photosIts time in service, however, is slowly but steadily coming to a grinding halt. The last Crown Victoria-based Police Interceptor rolled off the assembly line in 2011, and its direct successor is the Taurus V6-based Police Interceptor, a unibody available in front- and all-wheel-drive flavors. Be that as it may, some agencies still run the pursuit-rated Crown Vic, praising its all-inclusive appeal.\n\nNews 3 Las Vegas reports that Nevada Highway Patrol has retired its final Crown Victoria after many years of fighting traffic offenders alongside the men and women in blue. \"I know when I was a trooper a long time ago, I actually pushed a semi with my Crown Vic,\" commented John O'Rourke, the interim chief of the NHP. John also praised the room in the back seat of the body-on-frame blast from the past, as well as the trunk's volume (20.6 cu.ft.).\n\nIn Nevada, the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor has been replaced by the more frugal Dodge Charger and a handful of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles. According to NHP trooper Jason Buratczuk, the more modern replacements have quite a few advantages over the old-timer. \"We can take phone calls from dispatchers without having to pull over. And then when we initiate a traffic stop, we can initiate our lights right from the steering wheel.\"\n\nThe most prominent exponent of the Ford Panther platform was sold from 1992 to the 2011 MY.

We'll meet the engine soon, since it is scheduled to make its debut on the new M5.\n\nThe mill, which will pack at least 600 ponies, will be mated to an eight-speed automatic, while sending its power to all four wheels. However, thanks to the automaker's new M xDrive all-paw hardware, the M8 Convertible should get a RWD mode allowing dancing aficionados to do their tire-shredding thing.\n\nAs revealed back in May, the engine will deliver a spicy soundtrack and we can't wait to see how the voice of the car feels with the top down.\n\nUnderneath the skin, we'll find a modular platform mixing aluminum, high-strength steel and magnesium. As such, the M8 Convertible should lose up to 100 kg compared to the M6 Convertible. The diet will bring benefits on both the handling and the coziness fronts, so the move is more than welcome.When will we get to enjoy the charms of the BMW M8 Convertible?\n\nThe answer to the question above is obviously approximate.

The next big thing after \"democratizing\" EVs with the likes of the Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla Model 3 is for EV technology to grab a foothold in the light commercial vehicle segment. 6 photosFord is one of the automakers that explicitly confirmed it plans to do exactly that. As a brief refresher, the Ford Motor Company plans to introduce seven electrified vehicles by the year 2022, with six more coming after that. The highlights are the EcoBoost-powered Mustang Hybrid, F-150 Hybrid, and the Transit Custom PHEV. But then again, Ford of Germany has an electric commercial vehicle of its own, which is called Streetscooter Work XL.\n\nDeutsche Post DHL accepted the challenge of trialling 150 pre-production Streetscooter Work XL vehicles in Germany, with the e-vans being designed for parcel deliveries. Based on the Ford Transit and equipped with a battery-electric drivetrain built to the German postal service's specifications, each and every Work XL could save five tons of CO2 and 1,900 liters of fuel each year. Ford plans to manufacture 2,500 units by the end of 2018, which would result in a total saving of 12,500 tons of CO2 and 4.75 million liters of diesel.\n\nWith a load volume of 20 cubic meters, the Work XL brags with sufficient stowage space for 200 parcels, if not more. Equipped with a modular battery system ranging from 30 kWh to 90 kWh, the e-van's driving range is estimated at anything between 80 and 200 kilometers (i.e. approximately 50 - 124 miles). The 22 kW fast-charge system allows for adequately fast charging. More specifically, Ford promises three hours on average.\n\n\"Buses, cars, and of course, delivery vans play vital roles in our daily lives, but we have to find a way to make them cleaner.

And, as power-greedy aficionados will be thrilled to notice, the 2019 Mercedes-AMG G63 continues to reveal itself bit by bit. 6 photosThe latest prototype sighting allows us to notice the vertical slats of the German automaker's famous Panamericana grille underneath the faux bits covering the nose of the car.\n\nSome might expect the Panamericana grille to be a special feature reserved for the G65 limited edition. Nevertheless, since, for instance, we've recently shown you a 2019 Mercedes-AMG G63 sporting a similar visual feature, such a conclusion would be wrong.\n\nThis prototype also shows the all-LED front and rear lights - while the classic shape of the clusters has remained nearly untouched, the all-new tech inside will make for a sweet mix.\n\nReturning to the striptease process mentioned in the intro, we'll remind you that, back in June, we were able to take a peek inside the cabin of the new G63.\n\nFrom the increased cabin width, to the E-Class Coupe-like air conditioning vents, there are quite a lot of features that will make life inside the W464 G-Class much nicer.\n\nOn the tech front, the G63 will ditch the current twin-turbo 5.5-liter V8 in favor of the M177 twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8. While the unit delivers up to 612 hp and 850 Nm (627 lb-ft) on the E63 S 4Matic+, we should see the output dropping slightly below the 600 hp mark for the Gelandewagen.\n\nNevertheless, the most important question revolving around the hardware changes brought by the new generation revolves around the front differential lock - will the new multi-link front axle see the G-Class losing the said feature?\n\nSince the newcomer is expected to lose up to 400 kg (make that 880 lbs) compared to the current car, offroading enthusiasts might want to look away now - the answer could be \"yes\".\n\nOn the upside, the extra muscle and the hefty diet could see the 2019 Mercedes-AMG G63 rivaling the (base) Porsche 911 0 to 60 mph sprint time.\n\nWith the non-Affalterbach incarnations of the second-gen G-Class set to land by the end of the year, we should see the G63 landing a few months later, with the uber-offroader probably coming to the US as a 2019 model.\n\n2019 mercedes-amg g63 Mercedes-AMG mercedes-Benz G-Class G-Class spy video An Ode to Embracing the Metric System Travel Checklist & Tips For a Long Car Journey 2017 Sinaia Concours d'Elegance: A 77-Year Disappearance Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

As highlighted by the Mustang 6G forum, a leaked document on the Euro-spec Mustang reveals that both the EcoBoost-powered and GT models will get clear reflectors in the headlights and clear taillights.\n\nHood vents are go for all 2018 model year vehicles, as is a fake gas cap on the rear panel. Tri-bar DRLs come standard, as does the digital instrument cluster that's available as an option in the United States. The V8-powered GT ships with Michelin tires instead of yesteryear's Pirelli rubber, with the 5.0-liter Coyote gaining between 15 and 25 horsepower from the current 421 HP.\n\nQuad exhaust tips are standard on the Euro-spec 2018 Ford Mustang GT, as is the active valve exhaust system. Interestingly enough, the Ecoboost \"loses a few HP but gets more torque\" according to the document in question. Also new for the mid-cycle revamp are three exterior colors: Burgundy Velvet, Orange Fury, and Kona Blue.

The big news is SkyActiv-X, which is dubbed as the first commercial gasoline engine to use compression ignition. And so, when will SkyActiv-X go official? 99 photosAccording to the launch plan for Mazda's next-generation technologies, the spark plug-less gasoline engine will go official in 2019. That same year, the Japanese automaker will introduce SkyActiv-Body Gen 2 and SkyActiv Chassis Gen 2, both of them integrated into the next generation of the Mazda3.\n\nThe 2019 Mazda3 is also the recipient of the overhauled Connect infotainment system, as well as Kodo - Soul Of Motion Gen 2 design language. For all intents and purposes, the next-gen model will bring together pretty much all the relevant technologies Mazda has prepared for the coming decade. These include some sort of mild-hybrid system, possibly of the 48-volt variety.\n\nAs it happens, 2019 will be a busy year for the Hiroshima-based manufacturer. Concomitantly with the all-new Mazda3, the company will step up its game with two battery-powered EVs. The first of two is an all-electric affair, while the second is confirmed to use some sort of range extender.\n\nAccording to various reports and a tell-tale patent filing, the internal combustion engine could be of the rotary variety. And as a brief refresher, Mazda is working with Toyota for making its electric dreams come true.\n\nMoving on to 2020, that's when Mazda plans to introduce Co-Pilot Concept. By Co-Pilot, the automaker refers to autonomous driving technology. By the year 2025, Mazda plans to make Co-Pilot standard across the model lineup.\n\nAlso in 2020, Mazda will debut the SkyActiv-D Gen 2. At the present moment, the turbo diesel engine family consists of two choices: 1.5 and 2.2 liters. Last, but certainly not least, Mazda will launch some sort of plug-in hybrid vehicle in the period that reads \"2021 and beyond\" in the featured slide.\n\nWhat the slide pictured above doesn't mention, however, is that the next BT-50 mid-size pickup truck will be based on Isuzu's third-generation D-Max.

That's the \"buy it now\" price for arguably the weirdest Ferrari 250 GTE in existence today, a grand tourer that takes its mojo from a destroked Chevrolet small-block V8. 26 photosAn other-worldly example of hot rodding, the red-painted 250 GTE started life in 1963, then was converted into a 250 GTO at some point during its life. Joe Alessandrino, however, didn't want just another replica of the world's most expensive classic Ferrari, so he modified the car to his liking. Don't, however, dismiss the Chevy V8 swap as just another humdrum hack-and-improvise job.\n\nAccording to the seller, Alessandrino spent an estimated $150,000 on restoration, customization, new parts, bodywork... eh, work, and paint over the course of three years. All the windows, for example, are original. The frame, however, is a custom build boasting an Art Morrison suspension, triangulated 4-bar rear axle, and 4-point adjustable coil-over shocks.\n\nThe six-speed manual transmission is a Borg-Warner Tremec T56 salvaged from a Dodge Viper, which benefits from a hydraulic clutch with double overdrive. Tipping the scales at under 3,000 pounds, the Ferrevy or Chevrari is propelled by a 350-bore American V8 built to shift at 7,200 rpm. With the Ford 9-inch Trac-Loc differential running 4:56 gearing, the Chevy-sourced V8 interloper can thrust the 250 GTE to 160 miles per hour, realistically speaking.\n\nLove it or hate it, it's impossible to deny the special factor of this 250 GTE. Sure the 3.0-liter Colombo V12 of the original Gran Turismo Evoluzione is more aristocratic than an American powerplant, but let's try and see the glass half full. With this build, the Chevrolet small-block V8 engine reiterates its popularity with the hot rodding crowd, sitting alongside Ford's flathead V8.\n\n\"This car is an exhalent [sic] driver, with that said it comes with some driving patina. Such as a chip or very small scratch,\" the seller notes in the eBay ad.\n\nFerrari 250 GTE v8 Ferrari Chevrolet small-block V8 hot rod Chevrolet Spare The Tires: Why Most New Cars Are Not Built For Road Trips Five Signs You Need To Take Your Car To Get Serviced 2017 Sinaia Concours d'Elegance: A 77-Year Disappearance An Ode to Embracing the Metric System BMW TwinPower Turbo Engines Explained Headwave TAG Helmet Music and Navigation System Reviewed Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

The sporty... um, sport utility vehicle went on to be the best-selling Porsche nameplate of them all. Then the Macan compact luxury crossover stole the sales crown. 14 photosNow in its second generation, the Cayenne as we know it hasn't changed much since it went into production in 2010. Seven years on, it's high time for the German automaker to bring something new to the table, something even sportier, more technologized, and more luxurious than the current model.\n\nAccording to Car & Driver, the newcomer should be unveiled on August 29. The report suggests only force-fed V6 power will be offered in the first instance, with the twin-turbo V8 engine to make its debut later on at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show. Based on the latest spy photos, which leave little to the imagination of expecting customers, the C & D write-up holds water.\n\nPorsche recently organized a media preview of the 2018 Cayenne, and all the German publications reflect Car & Driver's information on the debut. Based on the MLB platform that underpins the Audi Q7 and Bentley Bentayga, the third-generation Cayenne will borrow many bits and bobs from the Panamera, including the modern-looking cockpit layout. Reportedly, expect a drop in curb weight of up to 70 kg (154 pounds) compared to the old Cayenne.\n\nExpected to start in Germany from approximately 70,000 euros, the 2018 Porsche Cayenne will gain turbo diesel power at some point in the near future. Regardless of what sort of engine hides under the hood, the high-riding breed will make use of the silky smooth ZF 8HP eight-speed auto.\n\nInternally referred to as E3, the 2018 Porsche Cayenne will likely borrow the plug-in hybrid powertrain from the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid and Turbo S E-Hybrid. The latter is expected to act as the range-topping derivative, packing 680 PS (671 horsepower) and 850 Nm (627 pound-feet) of oomph. 2018 porsche cayenne E3 Porsche Cayenne SUV Porsche 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars Car Repairs - These Are The Cheapest Things That May Go Wrong on An Automobile 2017 Sinaia Concours d'Elegance: A 77-Year Disappearance Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

Sure, the Aventador SV hasn't received a successor yet, since the Aventador S replaces the standard car, if we may call it so. But the sea of other hyperpowered machines that have landed since the March 2015 introduction of the Aventador SV backs up the idea we dropped above. 13 photosSo, what tricks do Aventador SV owners turn to in order to keep their rides under the spotlights? We'll start by mentioning an aftermarket route that doesn't need to be pursued by such aficionados - given the tech might of the 750 hp Sant'Agata Bolognese machine, there's no need to performance upgrades. Keep in mind that we're talking about the most responsive V12 model in the history of the Raging Bull, a machine that can lap the Nurburgring in under seven minutes, sitting just a few seconds behind the Porsche 918 Spyder, for instance.\n\nAs such, a wrap is enough to give such a Lamborghini the fresh touch required by the said purpose. And the latest example of such a second skin job comes from Dubai.\n\nThat's where a Lamborghini Aventador SV that left the factory dressed in yellow has gone through a complex visual transformation, all with the help of a neat wrap design.\n\nAs you noticed in the title above, we decided to use the desert bull label for this one.\n\nThe pixels that make up this eye-catching second skin job come from digital artist Scott Kepple. We're talking about a 1s and 0s wielder whose creations we featured on countless occasions.\n\nNow, you might wonder about the kind of places the said Lamborghini likes to visit when the thing is not putting its V12 to use on the UAE's neat roads.\n\nWell, the Instagram video at the bottom of the page should provide a respectable answer to this question - be prepared to meet the four-wheeled friends of this Lambo.\n\nA post shared by MO7AMED AL-ALI \u06457\u0645\u062f \u0622\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u064a (@mo7dxb) on Aug 13, 2017 at 6:05pm PDT\n\nA post shared by MO7AMED AL-ALI \u06457\u0645\u062f \u0622\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u064a (@mo7dxb) on Aug 13, 2017 at 5:37pm PDT\n\nAt @don_casanova_75's mansion.

However, 2018 variants, including the F3 675, F3 800, and Dragster 800, will come with a series of engine, electronics, and exhaust modifications to bring them in line with regulations.\n\nThe overall noise is said to be cut down by 50 percent while exhaust gas emissions are 48 percent lower than the current Euro 3 counterparts. The good news is that power isn't going down, with the F3 675 cranking 128 hp, the F3 800 putting down 144 hp, and the Dragster 800 generating 140 hp.\n\nThe first two mentioned models also come with new frame mounts that are said to improve the bikes' torsional and longitudinal rigidity. All the inline-three engines are fitted with new balance shafts, oil and water pump, drive gearing, and primary gearing as an effort to reduce noise and increase efficiency.\n\nMore internal modifications include modified intake cam and valves, as well as new valve springs. The exhaust is bigger thanks to a new catalytic converter, while the gear shifter has been improved via redesigned gear dogs for crisp changes.\n\nLast but not least, the 2018 models will also be gifted with new electronics coming in the shape of new fuel maps for better efficiency as well as eight-stage traction control, similar to what you get on a Dragster RR.\n\nPricing information hasn't been released, but MV Agusta is also happy to announce a new roadside assistance program in the United States.\n\nPartnering with Motorcycle Towing Services (MTS), MV Agusta USA will now provide all new MY2017 (and onwards) motorcycles with a two-year roadside assistance program at the time of purchase - 24 hours per day, 365 days a year. mv agusta dragster MV Agusta MV Agusta F3 naked Spare The Tires: Why Most New Cars Are Not Built For Road Trips Travel Checklist & Tips For a Long Car Journey Modern Car Technologies That Aren't So Modern Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

Despite the camouflage, you can almost see the resemblance to the smaller GLC 63 as the uber-SUV has begun its Nurburgring testing sessions. 5 photosNordschleife spy Supercarsfromeu has captured not only the GLE 63 making its maiden voyage but also other versions of the new GLE on this most famous of test tracks.\n\nEven though these are 2+ ton behemoths on wheels, they corner without much in the way of body lean, which makes us think that Mercedes has fitted the same kind of trick electronically controlled roll bars as the Audi SQ7. The 48-volt electric system is a certainty, given the new powertrains use it to save fuel.\n\nThe demands placed on a modern performance SUV have changed in recent years. You have air suspension available even on the GLC and Audi Q5, something that used to be reserved for the biggest and most expensive models. So to keep Russian oligarchs flocking to the GLE 63, Mercedes needs to bring its A-game.\n\nThe powertrain for this SUV is almost certain to be a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 producing the same 612 horsepower as in the E63 S. There should also be a \"regular\" 571 horsepower model. Will it drift? Probably not, but the straight-line performance will be extreme.\n\nStyling is also a big part of what the GLE 63 is about. As you can see, most of the bodywork differs from the regular model - flared arches and doors, the Panamericana grille, bigger air intakes and more aggression all-round.\n\nWe believe that one of the other GLE-Class prototypes is the successor to the current 43 model. In place of the 3-liter V6, it should deliver around 430 hp from an inline-six mill of the twin-turbo variety. There will also be a vanilla version of that engine in the GLE 450, as well as new inline-6 diesel engines. Even plug-in hybrids will be part of the mix, but a non-AMG V8 model looks unlikely.\n\n2019 mercedes-amg gle 63 Mercedes-AMG GLE 63 spyshots spy video Why the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon Is Late to the Party BMW TwinPower Turbo Engines Explained From Wrecks and Rust to Riches: A Story of Passion and Business Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

Almost 115,000 examples were manufactured from 2009 to 2016, all of them at the BMW plant in Regensburg, Germany. Roughly a year since the curtain fell, the successor of the E89 Z4 will make its debut in concept guise at Pebble Beach. 15 photosThe name is BMW Roadster Concept and all we knew until now is how it looks from the profile, coming courtesy of a teaser photo. Now, however, the automaker returns with more information on the concept for the G29 Z4. Its Japanese brother - n\u00e9e 2018 Toyota Supra - is internally identified as J29.\n\nPromising a sporty and progressive design, the Roadster Concept \"expresses the new BMW design language from all perspectives and in all details.\" What that really means, it remains to be seen at Pebble Beach this Thursday.\n\nAdrian van Hooydonk, who's job title reads senior vice president of the BMW Group's design department, digs the looks of the Roadster Concept. \"From the dynamic-looking front to the striking flanks to the clean-cut tail end: a few lines and the subtle interplay between surfaces are enough to generate a sense of power and emotion,\" he said, adding that \"the series-production version of the car is set to be unveiled over the course of next year.\"\n\nBased on spy photos of pre-production vehicles, the retractable hardtop roof is gone and it its place comes a lighter, more classically-correct soft top. Then there's the matter of transmission choices, with the Z4 being offered with a six-speed manual even in the United States. The Supra, by comparison, doesn't get a manual, and that's a bit of a shame when you think about it.\n\nThe range-topping model will be the M40i, which employs the B58 turbo inline-six that develops 360 PS (355 hp). Lower down the lineup, the 2018 BMW Z4 will be available in the sDrive30i and sDrive20i. Both models rely on the B48 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder used in the F30 330i and G30 530i.\n\nAlso on August 17 at Pebble Beach's world-renowned Concours d'Elegance, the BMW Concept 8 Series is set to make its North American premiere. 2018 BMW Z4 G29 BMW Z4 concept BMW BMW Roadster Concept Pebble Beach Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

All three of them have benefitted from the recent facelift (or whatever the hell that was), which means it's the perfect time to compare some hot laps on an equally hot South African track.\n\nFirst up is the Volkswagen Golf GTI. All three cars use two-liter engines, with the GTI and the R actually sharing the same block. Gone are the days when the R meant there was a three-liter V6 unit under the hood, but that doesn't mean there still isn't a great power gap between the two.\n\nThe GTI has a peak power of 230 hp, but it reaches it from much lower RPMs than the R's 310 hp. In terms of torque, the figures are a lot closer: 350 Nm (258 lb-ft) for the GTI and 400 Nm (295 lb-ft) for the R. However, it's enough to put 1.8 seconds between the two in their respective 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) sprint times as the GTI takes 6.4 seconds while the R needs 4.6 seconds.Diesel's not dead (yet)\n\nThe GTD comes second. As it gets on the track, you can already hear that diesel rattle that so many people feel has no place on a racing circuit. But the GTD is part of that rare breed of cars that can really go light on the fuel consumption when driven reasonably, but also turn into a bit of a hot hatch when pushed hard.\n\nBut we can't fool anyone. Despite having the same torque figures as the GTI, it only comes with 184 hp and an extra 30 kilograms (66 lb). Unless the Holy Spirit decides to intervene, it's bound to come up last. The only question is how far behind?\n\nFinally, the top model of the Golf range enters the scene. The R has received a little buff, which - coupled with the fact it's the only four-wheel-drive car here - should give it more than enough resources to smoke the competition. Like the GTD, that was a given from the start, but how much faster is the fastest Golf 'round a track?\n\nAccording to the guys at Cars.co.za, not fast enough, and we tend to agree with them. With just three seconds off the GTI's time on a 3.1 km-long track (1.92 miles), it does little to justify the extra money from a rational stand point. In fact, by being eight seconds slower than the R and five slower than the GTI, the GTD is the one making the most sense. That is if you can live with the fact you're driving a diesel Volkswagen - which, if you're based in Europe, you probably can.\n\nVolkswagen Golf GTI Volkswagen Golf Golf Volkswagen Golf GTD Volkswagen Golf R Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

Opt for the seven-speed automatic transmission, which adds more sophisticated rear suspension to the menu, and you're looking at \u00a329,500 on the road. The mid-range ELX model is available with both transmissions, whereas the \u00a337,500 Ultimate trim comes exclusively with the Mercedes-Benz 7G-Tronic slushbox.\n\nRegardless of tranny and grade, there's only one engine available for the UK-spec Rexton. e-XDi 220 is its name, it displaces 2.2 liters, and it's good for 181 PS (179 bhp) and 420 Nm (310 lb-ft) of torque. Scheduled to arrive at British dealers in October 2017, the all-new SsangYong Rexton is the ideal vehicle for caravanning thanks to a maximum towing capacity of 3.5 tons.\n\nFrom the get-go, the Rexton EX comes with 17-inch alloy wheels, air conditioning, 8-inch infotainment, seven seats, parking sensors both front and rear, automatic headlights and wipers, cruise control, and even autonomous emergency braking. For goodies such as Nappa leather upholstery and the bigger infotainment system, the ELX fits the bill nicely. For all the bells and whistles, including 3D around-view monitoring, go for the Ultimate trim level.\n\nAlso standard is the four-wheel-drive system, which engages the front axle electronically. Both high and low-ratio modes are built into the 4WD system for adequate on- and off-road capability, with the Rexton boasting approach and departure angles of 20.5 and 22.2 degrees, respectively.\n\n\"Rexton is the second addition to our all-new model lineup,\" declared Paul Williams, chief executive officer of SsangYong Motor UK. \"SsangYong is committed to introducing a new car every year for the next three years, which includes a pickup truck derived from Rexton early in 2018.\"\n\nThe all-new SsangYong Rexton - full details here: https://t.co/guPnFWeXzO #SsangYong #Rexton #SUV #4x4 pic.twitter.com/BYaqvEalA9 -- SsangYong Motor UK (@SYMotorUK)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\n2018 SsangYong Rexton UK Ssangyong Rexton RHD SsangYong price SUV Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars Five Signs You Need To Take Your Car To Get Serviced Age of Enlightenment With a Mazda MX-5 RF on The Transfagarasan An Ode to Embracing the Metric System Travel Checklist & Tips For a Long Car Journey Modern Car Technologies That Aren't So Modern Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

However, unlike your Optima 2.0T, the new Stinger puts the power down at the back. 25 photosThe Stinger GT is undoubtedly the star of the show right now, with its 3.3-liter twin-turbo V6 delivering sports car performance. But they just launched a four-cylinder model in South Korea this week, and it's not that bad.\n\nThe engine produces 256 horsepower and 353 Nm of torque. Naturally, hot hatch outputs deliver hot hatch performance, as the 0 to 100 km/h sprint is dealt with in 6 seconds. But the top speed is a little disappointing: 232 km/h claimed, and only 225 km/h reached in this test.\n\nThe base model Stinger weighs 1,670 kilograms and uses 225/40 R19 front tires with 255/35 R19 ones at the back. With the cruise control set to 90 km/h, this Korean four-door coupe averages 7.9 km/l which is equivalent to just over 12 l/100km, which isn't that great.\n\nIf it's fuel economy you're after, Kia also makes a 2.2-liter diesel version of the car. But at 200 horsepower, you trade a lot of the performance, plus you're not going to be able to buy this version in America.\n\nAs a 2018 model year vehicle, the Stinger is still awaiting official pricing in the States. However, the base model with the 2-liter is expected to sticker at $30,000 while the V6 with all the performance goodies will go over $50,000.\n\nThe Stinger is Kia's first premium sports sedan. It competes with the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes C-Class, and its sister car, the Genesis G80 Sport. The V6-powered Stinger GT is the fastest accelerating Kia in production. We're not surprised that it's a good-looking machine. As you can see from the photo gallery we've attached, it's got the signature tiger-nose grille, bold intakes, and headlights. Our favorite feature is the Porsche Panamera-like cargo hatch.\n\n2018 Kia Stinger Kia Stinger Stinger 2.0 Turbo Spare The Tires: Why Most New Cars Are Not Built For Road Trips The Dos and Don'ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part One Headwave TAG Helmet Music and Navigation System Reviewed An Ode to Embracing the Metric System The Dos and Don'ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part Two (Final) From Wrecks and Rust to Riches: A Story of Passion and Business Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

But the Tucson FCEV, known as ix35 FCEV in Europe, is getting on a bit. It's no wonder, then, that the time is high for the Seoul-based outfit to bring something new to the table. 7 photosEnter Hyundai's Next Generation FCEV, which is a near-production fuel cell electric SUV wrapped as a concept. The first recipient of the automaker's fourth-generation fuel cell technology has 20 percent more ponies than the Tucson FCEV/ix35 FCEV, priding itself on 163 PS or 161 brake horsepower.\n\nOptimized to start even at -30 degrees Celsius (22 degrees Fahrenheit), the powertrain's main bragging right is the 60 percent efficiency level, which is 9 percentage points better than the preceding fuel cell electric SUV. So to speak, Hyundai is targeting a driving range of 800 kilometers (497 miles) according to the testing procedures of the lab-based New European Driving Cycle, which is much better than the predecessor's 600 km (373 m).\n\nThe yet-unnamed production model will be joined by 2020 by another fuel cell electric vehicle, 8 battery-powered EVs, 8 plug-in hybrids, and 10 hybrid vehicles. That's right, ladies and gentlemen! In total, the Hyundai Motor Company intends to launch 28 eco-friendly vehicles by 2020's end.\n\nAccording to Hyundai, the name of the fuel cell electric SUV and the advanced driver assistance technologies it will come equipped will be made public in January 2018 at the Consumer Electronics Show. In related news, the compact-sized Kona SUV will gain a battery-powered electric variant in the first half of 2018, which will boast a range of up to 390 km (242 m).\n\nIn 2021, luxury division Genesis Motors will launch its first-ever EV, while a Hyundai-branded long-range EV will join the fray with approximately 500 kilometers (373 miles) of driving range. \"Hyundai Motor will take the lead in developing and producing green energy vehicles that would ultimately complement a near-zero emission society,\" declared Lee Ki-sang, the senior vice president of Hyundai Motor Group's Eco Technology Center.

Shoehorning the Windsor V8 into a British car was just the beginning of Shelby's close collaboration with the Ford Motor Company, with the GT350 Mustang following in the mid-1960s. 18 photosThe magnum opus of the series is the GT350R, a race-spec pony made to dominate the racetrack. Only 34 production models and 2 factory prototypes were ever built, making it one of the rarest Mustang derivatives of all time. Automotive designer Peter Brock, known for his work on the Shelby Daytona Coupe, is responsible for many of the upgrades that made the GT350R what it is, and his company intends to build a continuation series of the original. But with a twist, coming in the form of Ford independent rear suspension.\n\nHis outfit, dubbed Original Venice Crew, received the necessary paperwork from Carroll Shelby Licensing and Ford to recreate the original GT350R in his own view, but he's not alone in this undertaking. He's joined by former Shelby American employees Jim Marietta and Ted Sutton, and the trio's intent is to manufacture 36 examples of the continuation GT350R. The independent rear suspension, however, isn't the only update on the original go-faster pony.\n\nRedesigned front valance, lightweight Plexiglas windows, better airflow, and superior road holding, that's what the retro-modern GT350R is all about. \"During track testing, people began to ask if the car was for sale,\" explained Sutton, former master fabricator at Shelby. \"After a landslide of inquiries, we decided to see if there was a good case for offering a limited run of them.\"\n\nDon't, however, dare ask how much the 289-cu.in. V8-powered monster costs. The OVC will make the 36-strong Shelby GT350R continuation series happen in Southern California, just like the boys did back in the '60s. The build begins with a 1965 donor Mustang, and each body shell is reconditioned before the OVC converts it to competition specification or for street duty.\n\nThe finished car will be shown at Monterey during the Classic Car Week.

Even childish, maybe, especially since its truck was first supposed to have an electric powertrain with a range extender, but in the meantime, it switched to a hydrogen fuel cell setup.\n\nIt's this type of inconsistency that casts doubt over Nikola Motor's capabilities to go through with its promises, and it doesn't help when it says it will deliver things that even established names in the industry can't yet achieve.\n\nThe electric big rig is not the company's only product, though. Late last year, it has shown the first real images of its Zero electric UTV, a fun-oriented off-road vehicle that was supposed to come with a 72 kWh battery pack and a maximum range of 100-200 miles.\n\nWell, those specs have now been updated, and if you thought they were ridiculous in the first place for this type of a vehicle, listen to this: it turns out the Nikola Zero will come with 415 hp as standard, and 3,675 lb-ft of instant torque (around 5,000 Nm). The upgraded version brings 555 hp and 4,900 lb-ft of twist power (6,643 Nm).\n\nThe Zero has four seats, four-wheel-drive, and will reportedly reach 60 mph (97 km/h) in under four seconds for the top version. The company also claims that the base model will cost a purely randomly chosen $35,000. But we haven't gotten to the best part yet.\n\nThe previously announced 72 kWh battery pack has now morphed into a 75 kWh one, but the Nikola Zero gets two more options: either 100 kWh or 125 kWh. The latter makes the Nikola Zero the EV with the second largest battery pack after Faraday Future FF91's 130 kWh unit, with the very important mention that both these vehicles are purely hypothetical at this point.\n\nNikola Motor has also revealed a production plan for what will become its first commercial vehicle, and it's coming sooner than you'd think. The Zero is supposed to be available for test drives at dealerships (?) in December with orders launching in January. Since the UTV is going to be road legal in some states (thanks to an optional package from the manufacturer), there should be plenty of interested parties in the Nikola Zero. Provided it delivers everything it has promised.\n\nBelow you'll see an older video showing the UTV in an earlier stage (and with road tires), but the image gallery has renderings showing the alleged production version. We can see it's quite a tall vehicle, most of which is probably due to the large battery pack fitted under the floor.\n\nNikola Zero Nikola Motor nikola one EV electric utv UTV Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars Travel Checklist & Tips For a Long Car Journey Headwave TAG Helmet Music and Navigation System Reviewed Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

On display in Bneasa Shopping City from August 18 to 21, the exhibition is centered focused on a BMW i8 beautified by Garage Italia Customs. 18 photos\"We want to encourage the public to explore and discover the BMW i8 design, as it is so spectacular. We have seen in the past that everybody wants to take pictures with the car, so why not make the presentation of the BMW i8 exactly about that,\" declared Dana Popescu, BMW i brand manager for Romania.\n\n\"This is how #SELFI8 project was born,\" she concluded, and we totally agree with the people wanting to take photos part. The intricate styling plus the other-worldly persona of the i8, they attract passersby and motorists like some sort of four-wheeled magnet. As a testament to the drawing power of the plug-in hybrid BMW sports car, even girls took photos of the i8 when it was in the autoevolution's hands for review.\n\nPresented in a photo studio set-up with professional lighting designed to bring out the quality of the project's photos and videos, the car also happens to be even more alluring than the standard i8. Presented at the 2016 Paris Motor Show, the i8 CrossFade is more than just a combination of Protonic Blue and Protonic Dark Silver. The way one color transitions into the other is what makes the limited-run car special, as does the triangular dashes of paint.\n\nIn related news, BMW prepares to take the wraps off the i8 Roadster and the facelift for the fix-head coupe. The most conservative of reports suggest the plug-in hybrid powertrain will be improved to 372 horsepower, while the rumor mill argues in favor of 400 ponies worth of combined maximum output. Expect to see the i8 Roadster show what it's made of this November at the 2017 L.A.

They both carry the e-tron name, of course, but one of them will receive the Sportback monicker, while the other will be called 'quattro.'\n\nThe latter of the two is the one showing up in this photos, revealing a body shape that's just too sexy for Audi to use strictly with for an alternative propulsion system. The e-tron quattro looks miles better than the larger Q8 - if anything, it resembles Audi's version of the Porsche Macan. With some minor modifications (like the grille, for example), it would make the perfect Q6, if you ask us - most definitely with an RSQ6 version as well.\n\nThe Audi e-tron quattro should be announced sometime during next year, meaning it will likely enter the market as a 2019 model year. The company's next plans for its e-tron range include the smaller Sportback coupe crossover, as well as a rumored sedan to fight it out with Tesla's Model 3, even though it looks like the American EV will have a significant headstart.\n\nThey say Audi's electric SUV is going to have a maximum range of 500 kilometers (310 miles) according to the NEDC standard, which means it won't bring any breakthrough in the battery technology. However, Audi needs to move fast as Mercedes-Benz has a similar model planned for its EQ sub-brand around the same time, so it's not just Tesla's Model Y it needs to worry about.\n\nThe spy shots show us a compact-sized SUV with plenty of ground clearance and also a squat stance that's more promising for a dynamic handling than off-road abilities. Of course, until they build charging stations in the forests and on top of mountains, off-roading in an electric vehicle remains something completely fictional.\n\nSpeaking of charging stations, Audi should make the e-tron quattro capable of draining power from the high-output outlets planned to start spreading over the whole of Europe, meaning it could recharge its battery completely (or at least 80%) in no more than twenty minutes under ideal conditions.\n\nConsidering everything we've seen and heard so far, if Audi manages to keep the e-tron quattro's price at a relatively moderate level (for an EV, of course), we don't see any reason why the Ingolstadt electric SUV won't be a success, provided there is an ample number of charging sites as well. Which, unlike Tesla, is not something the German company controls itself. audi e-tron quattro Audi e-tron Audi EV electric electric SUV quattro Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars Travel Checklist & Tips For a Long Car Journey Modern Car Technologies That Aren't So Modern Why the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon Is Late to the Party Ten Cheap Car Hacks That May Help You Deal With Day-To-Day Issues From Wrecks and Rust to Riches: A Story of Passion and Business Spare The Tires: Why Most New Cars Are Not Built For Road Trips The Dos and Don'ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part One 2017 Sinaia Concours d'Elegance: A 77-Year Disappearance Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

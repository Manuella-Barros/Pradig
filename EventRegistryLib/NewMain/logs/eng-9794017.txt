These [complaints] are for people to get better. And the organising committee, so we'll put these back to our team in full depth and detail. But it's definitely been the best Games in terms of fans engaged with it. So you're never gonna have a perfect Games.\"\n\nAfter reading the claims made by Peaty, a Paris 2024 source urged caution over \"more sensationalist claims\". \"We have no information to be able to confirm the specific allegation,\" a spokesman added. \"&NoBreak;Team GB has confirmed that no such reports have been made to their staff.\n\n\"More generally, regarding food in the Village, our priority is to meet the needs of athletes from around the world to enable them to compete at their best. The 550 dishes on offer in the Dining Hall were developed together with the NOCs and the IOC over a period of more than a year.\"\n\nBy Peaty's high standards, it has been a difficult Games. He only won silver in the 100 metres breaststroke, testing positive for Covid the morning after. Peaty believes that pledges to make 60 per cent of all meals served at the Games meatless and a third plant-based have made it hard for many athletes to stick to their normal diet.\n\n\"The narrative of sustainability has just been punished [sic] on the athletes. I want to eat meat, I need meat to perform and that's what I eat at home, so why should I change?\" Peaty adds.\n\n\"I like my fish and people are finding worms in the fish. It's just not good enough. The standard, we're looking at the best of the best in the world, and we're feeding them not the best. I just want people to get better at their roles and jobs. And I think that's what the athletes are the best sounding board for.\"\n\nHodgkinson's coach Trevor Painter also said after her victory at the Stade de France on Monday that she had been avoiding the village food. \"The BOA have got a lodge 15 minutes from the village so she's been getting a lift across there to eat because it's a good bit better than the village,\" he said. \"She's not eaten a meal in the village.\"\n\nParis 2024 said: \"We are listening to the athletes and take their feedback very seriously. Since the opening of the village, our partner Sodexo Live! has been working proactively to adapt supplies to the growing use of the Olympic Village restaurants, as well as to the actual consumption by

Many internal issues of the Games have come to light, with athletes sharing updates about their life inside the village. Behind-the-scenes footage of the apartments has been revealed, while some athletes have also opened up about the food served at the campaign. Recently, British swimmer Adam Peaty raised questions regarding the catering service at the Paris Olympics. The three-time Olympic medalist, who earlier competed at the Rio and Tokyo Games, found the quality of food quite poor at this year's event. He also claimed that worms were found in the meal served at the Village.\n\n\"The catering isn't good enough for the level the athletes are expected to perform. We need to give the best we possibly can. In Tokyo, the food was incredible. In Rio, it was incredible. But this time around?

In this regard, the athletes have been provided with cardboard beds and the effect was seen in the food routine as well. According to media reports, the organisers have decided to serve 60 per cent of meatless meals at the Olympic Village.\n\nTo make it happen, athletes get plant-based food in their third meal.

As part of their extensive planning, the British Olympic Association had hired an entire catering college in nearby Clichy as a performance base and athletes including Hodgkinson have been avoiding the village in favour of the food cooked by the specialist Team GB chefs.\n\nOlympic organisers had boasted of Michelin chefs but athletes have complained of shortages and insufficient quality, prompting them instead to flock to the private British performance lodge which is full of supplies from Aldi and a team of on-site chefs overseen by the sports nutritionist Wendy Martinson.\n\nPeaty, 29, was in an outspoken mood as he claimed the team had been \"blindsided\" by the challenges of living in the village. \"The catering isn't good enough for the level the athletes are expected to perform,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to give the best we possibly can. Tokyo, the food was incredible, Rio was incredible. But this time around [...] there wasn't enough protein options, long queues, waiting 30 minutes for food because there's no queuing system. These [complaints] are for people to get better. And the organising committee, so we'll put these back to our team in full depth and detail. But it's definitely been the best Games in terms of fans engaged with it. So you're never gonna have a perfect Games.\"\n\nAfter reading the claims made by Peaty, a Paris 2024 source urged caution over \"more sensationalist claims\". \"We have no information to be able to confirm the specific allegation,\" a spokesman added. \"Team GB has confirmed that no such reports have been made to their staff.\n\n\"More generally, regarding food in the Village, our priority is to meet the needs of athletes from around the world to enable them to compete at their best. The 550 dishes on offer in the Dining Hall were developed together with the NOCs and the IOC over a period of more than a year.\"\n\nBy Peaty's high standards, it has been a difficult Games. He only won silver in the 100 metres breaststroke, testing positive for Covid the morning after. Peaty believes that pledges to make 60 per cent of all meals served at the Games meatless and a third plant-based have made it hard for many athletes to stick to their normal diet.\n\n\"The narrative of sustainability has just been punished [sic] on the athletes. I want to eat meat, I need meat to perform and that's what I eat at home, so why should I change?\" Peaty adds.\n\n\"I like my fish and people are finding worms in the fish.

Like the other athletes competing at the Games, Peaty has been staying in Paris' athletes village.\n\nAll meals are provided for by the organisers, with a huge restaurant on site. But the British superstar has now called the quality of the cooking into question, having been left furious by what has been served.\n\nPeaty insisted the food quality would be having a negative impact on performance, as he also slammed the organisers' pledge to make 60 percent of all meals served meatless and a third plant-based.\n\n\"The catering isn't good enough for the level the athletes are expected to perform,\" Peaty told the i. \"We need to give the best we possibly can. Tokyo the food was incredible. Rio was incredible.\n\n\"But this time around? There wasn't enough protein options, long queues, waiting 30 minutes for food because there's no queuing system. The narrative of sustainability has just been pushed on the athletes.\n\n\"I want meat, I need meat to perform and that's what I eat at home, so why should I change? I like my fish and people are finding worms in the fish. It's just not good enough. The standard, we're looking at the best of the best in the world, and we're not feeding them the best.\"\n\nTeam GB previously boycotted the Village over the catering in the first week of the Games. But organisers have insisted they are taking the concerns of athletes seriously. And they defended the work of their catering partner, revealing extra staff and supplies have been drafted into the Village.\n\n\"We are listening to the athletes and take their feedback very seriously. Since the opening of the village, our partner Sodexo Live! has been working proactively to adapt supplies to the growing use of the Olympic Village restaurants,\" A Paris 2024 spokesperson told the i.\n\n\"As well as to the actual consumption by athletes observed over the first few days. As a result, the quantities of certain products has been significantly increased and additional staff have been deployed to ensure the service runs smoothly.\"\n\nPeaty was also left furious following Team GB's defeat in the men's medley relay, which China won. Two of China's swimmers, Qin Haiyang and Sun Jiajun, were among the 23 who reportedly returned positive tests for the banned performance enhancing drug Trimetazidine prior to the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\"If you touch and you know that you're cheating, you're not winning, right?\" said Peaty. \"I don't want to paint a whole nation or group of people with one brush, I think that's very unfair. To the people that need to do their job - wake up and do your job.\n\n\"One of my favourite quotes I've seen lately is that there's no point winning if you're not winning fair. I think you know that truth in your heart. For me, if you've been on that and you have been contaminated twice, I think as an honourable person you should be out of the sport.

I want to eat meat, I need meat to perform and that's what I eat at home, so why should I change?\n\n\"I like my fish, and people are finding worms in the fish. It's just not good enough.\n\n\"The standard, we're looking at the best of the best in the world, and we're feeding them not the best.\n\n\"I just want people to get better at their roles and jobs. And I think that's what the athletes are the best sounding board for.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old also spoke about how the catering as a whole was 'not good enough', and that queues would often result in athletes waiting 30 minutes for food.\n\nA Paris 2024 Olympics spokesperson responded to Petty's comments, telling i: \"We are listening to the athletes and take their feedback very seriously.\n\n\"Since the opening of the Village, our partner Sodexo Live! has been working proactively to adapt supplies to the growing use of the Olympic Village restaurants, as well as to the actual consumption by athletes observed over the first few days.\n\n\"As a result, the quantities of certain products have been significantly increased and additional staff have been deployed to ensure that the service runs smoothly.\"\n\nSPORTbible has also contacted the IOC and Paris 2024 organisers for comment.\n\nPeaty's comments come after Italian swimmer Thomas Ceccon, who won gold in the 100m backstroke, also complained about the conditions in the village.\n\nHe said: \"In the village there is no air conditioning, it's hot, the food is bad. Many athletes move because of this ... it is not an alibi, it is the pure chronicle of what perhaps not everyone knows.\n\n\"I emphasise, this is not meant to be an excuse or an alibi, we are all experiencing the same situations and are in the same conditions. It is one thing many people probably do not know and it is right to tell the story.\"\n\nPeaty's disrupted Games are now over, with his final race in Paris the men's 4x100m medley relay final on Sunday.\n\nThe three-time Olympic gold medalist secured a silver medal in the 100m breaststroke final, but tested positive for Covid-19 last Monday.\n\nHe was fortunately well enough to compete in the relay final, where he produced a superb breaststroke leg before Team GB finished fourth.", "source": {"uri": "sportbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.sportbible.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "I (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Peaty", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Peaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodexo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sodexo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Ceccon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Ceccon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_at_the_Pan_American_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming at the Pan American Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaststroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breaststroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/blt0b96542b26e85d98/66b1e4f4f580c6a59f5d5ab5/Adam-Peaty-Paris-2024-Olympic-Village.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794017", "eventUri": "eng-9794017", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The 29-year-old silver medallist - who is dating chef Gordon Ramsay's daughter Holly - isn't alone in his dissatisfaction with the culinary offerings at the athletes' residence, which has become a contentious topic among competitors.\n\nLast week, reports surfaced of athletes' frustration over a lack of meat and eggs - key components of their protein-rich diets - as well as a shortage of bottled water, an essential in the sweltering Parisian heat.\n\nAdam, who clinched silver in the 100-metre breaststroke, has voiced his concerns about both the quality and quantity of food available, highlighting the unsettling discovery of worms in the fish provided.\n\nFurthermore, he expressed his disagreement with the organisers' decision to make 60 per cent of meals meatless and one-third plant-based, arguing that it hampers athletes' ability to maintain their usual diet.\n\nIn a conversation with i, Adam claimed: \"The narrative of sustainability has just been punished on the athletes. I want to eat meat, I need meat to perform and that's what I eat at home, so why should I change? I like my fish and people are finding worms in the fish. It's just not good enough.\", reports the Express.\n\n\"The standard, we're looking at the best of the best in the world, and we're feeding them not the best. I just want people to get better at their roles and jobs and I think that's what the athletes are the best sounding board for.\"\n\nAdam said the food at the Olympics in Tokyo and Rio was better than what was on offer in Paris, and also said athletes were sometimes queuing for 30 minutes to fill their plates.\n\nSign up to OK!'s daily newsletter to get updates sent to your inbox for free\n\nMoreover, he insisted, \"These [complaints] are for people to get better and the organising committee, so we'll put these back to our team in full depth and detail.

He says: 'It's just not good enough.'\n\nThe six-time Olympic medallist, who also contracted Covid-19 during the Games, is the latest athlete to express concerns about accommodation for Paris 2024.\n\nThe 29-year-old was heralded as one of Team GB's leading medal contenders ahead of Paris 2024, but only finished second in the 100m breaststroke, an event in which he has been virtually unbeatable for years.\n\nAfter missing out by two hundredths of a second, he admitted in his post-race interview that he was suffering from a sore throat and, sure enough, the next day he tested positive for Covid.\n\nAfter beating the virus sufficiently to compete in the men's 4x100m medley relay last weekend, he was dealt another blow when Team GB finished fourth. He is reportedly still on a potent cocktail of antibiotics.\n\nHowever, he has since lifted the lid on the alleged shocking catering in Paris, saying there were even 'worms in the fish'.\n\nAdam Peaty has lifted the lid on the state of food provided to athletes in the Olympic Village\n\nHe admitted that some athletes found \"worms in the fish\" at the Paris facility\n\n'The catering is not good enough for the level expected from the athletes. We have to give the best we can,' he told the i-newspaper.\n\n'Tokyo, the food was great, Rio was great. But this time [...] \"There weren't enough protein options, long lines, 30 minute wait for food because there was no queuing system.\"\n\nHe added: 'The sustainability narrative has just been punished with athletes. I want to eat meat, I need meat to perform and that's what I eat at home, so why would I change?' Peaty added.\n\n'I like my fish and people find worms in the fish. It's just not good enough.\n\n\"The standard is that we look at the best of the best in the world, and we don't give them the best.\n\n\"I just want people to be better at their roles and jobs. And I think athletes are the best sounding board for that.\"\n\nPeaty joins a growing number of athletes complaining about conditions in the Olympic Village.\n\nLast week, Italian gold medalist Thomas Ceccon was even spotted taking a nap in a Paris park, avoiding the athlete's accommodation.\n\nCeccon, who won gold in the men's 100m backstroke, said: 'There is no air conditioning in the village, it is hot and the food is bad.\n\n'Many athletes exercise for this reason: it's not an alibi or an excuse, it's the reality of what perhaps not everyone knows.\n\n'I normally always sleep at home in the afternoon: here I really struggle with the heat and the noise.'\n\nMeanwhile, others have also complained about food shortages during their stay in the Olympic Village, leading to Team GB flying in an emergency cook while food such as chicken and eggs were rationed by the organisers.\n\nThe Olympic Village's catering partner, Sodexo Live!, said it had taken the feedback \"seriously\" and noted that volumes would be increased to \"meet the needs of the athletes\" after noting \"very high demand for certain products\".\n\nOlympians promised dishes designed by Michelin-starred chefs regretted the food that was offered. British athletes even took their packed lunches back to the village for their evening meal in the run-up to the start of the Games.\n\nThomas Ceccon was caught sleeping in a park instead of the Olympic village\n\nCeccon has complained about the appalling conditions faced by athletes in Paris\n\nThe food offering has come under scrutiny, with Peaty also noting that the 'best in the world' are not being given the same standards of catering\n\nAriarne Titmus, Assia Touati and Coco Gauff have also expressed their concerns about the accommodation provided by the organisers in Paris.\n\nAfter defending her Olympic gold medal in the 400m freestyle, Australian swimmer Titmus felt she could have broken the world record if she had stayed in better accommodation.\n\n\"It probably wasn't the time I thought I could do, but living in the Olympic Village makes it difficult to perform,\" she admitted in a post-race interview.\n\n'It's certainly not meant for top performances, it's about who can really keep it together in their mind.'\n\nFrench swimmer Touati said: 'We didn't have air conditioning in the bedroom but they installed it anyway because it got too hot.'\n\nAnd 20-year-old tennis star Gauff revealed that she was the only member of the U.S. team left in the Olympic Village after her teammates fled to a hotel. She revealed that 10 women shared two bathrooms in her hallway.\n\nMeanwhile, an Algerian rower said: 'We have fans in the bedrooms, but it's not enough. It's too hot at night. We can't leave the windows open because of the mosquitoes -- too many mosquitoes.'\n\nAustralia, Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan, America and China all had air conditioning installed before the Games began, with AOC chief executive Matt Carroll saying: \"We like the concept of not having air conditioning because of the carbon footprint,\" but adding: \"These are high-performance Games. We're not having a picnic.\"\n\nThere have also been complaints of theft within the complex, after a number of athletes reported losing belongings and there were no signs of a break-in.\n\nThe beds in the Olympic Village have also been the subject of controversy due to their lack of comfort and their 'woke character'.\n\nThe single beds, produced by Airwave, feature cardboard frames as part of the organisers' sustainability efforts.\n\nThe 'anti-sex' cardboard beds went down a treat with Australian water polo player Tilly Kearns and her teammate Gabi Palm, who said after their first night: 'My back is about to come off'.\n\nThere is a lot of focus on sustainability at the Games, which is certainly a positive given the growing carbon footprint of global sport. However, there seems to be one downside: the impact it has on athletes' nutrition.\n\nA Paris Olympics spokesperson claimed that their partners have been working hard to 'adapt' the requirements to the Olympic Village, with additional staff hired to ensure the smooth running of the service.\n\nPeaty will take a step back from swimming after the Olympics, but has kept the door open for LA 2028\n\nPeaty finished fourth in the men's 4x100m medley relay after recovering from Covid\n\nPeaty's revelations about the Olympic Village came after he returned to the Olympics after quitting swimming due to mental health issues.\n\nBut after the men's 4x100m medley relay, he admitted he would be taking another step back.\n\n'I think [I] \"I have to step back from the sport because it just hurt too much this time, honestly,\" Peaty said.\n\n'Tomorrow is never promised, so why should I worry? If my heart wants it, my heart wants it, and I will absolutely sign that contract with myself to do it. But that may be a long way off.\n\n'This could have been my last dive here.\n\n'Mel (Marshall, Peaty's long-term coach) has an incredible future ahead of her in Australia and the right talent will come her way. I don't know what the answer is.'\n\nHowever, he has qualified those doubts about his future, admitting that he would still keep the door open to LA 2028 and would make a decision in \"two years\" on whether participating in another Games is \"feasible\".", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And I think that's what the athletes are the best sounding board for.'\n\nPeaty joins a growing number of athletes in complaining about the conditions at the Olympic Village.\n\nLast week, Italian gold medallist Thomas Ceccon was even spotted taking a nap in a Paris park to avoid the athlete's accommodation.\n\nCeccon, who won gold in the men's 100m backstroke, said: 'There is no air conditioning in the village, it's hot, the food is bad.\n\n'Many athletes move for this reason: it's not an alibi or excuse, it's the reality of what perhaps not everyone knows.\n\n'Usually, when I'm at home, I always sleep in the afternoon: here I really struggle between the heat and the noise.'\n\nMeanwhile, others have also complained about food shortages during their stay at Olympic Village. It led to Team GB flying out an emergency chef amid foods such as chicken and eggs being rationed by organisers.\n\nThe Olympic Village's catering partner, Sodexo Live!, said it had taken the feedback 'seriously', noting that volumes will be increased to 'satisfy the needs of the athletes' after noticing a 'very high demand for certain products'.\n\nOlympians promised cuisine designed by Michelin-starred chefs have lamented the food on offer. British athletes even resorted to taking packed lunches back to the village for their evening meal in the lead-up to the start of the Games.\n\nAriarne Titmus, Assia Touati and Coco Gauff have also raised concerns about the accommodation provided by Paris organisers.\n\nAfter defending her Olympic gold medal in the 400m freestyle, Aussie swimmer Titmus felt she could have broken the world record had she been staying in better accommodation.\n\n'It probably wasn't the time I thought I was capable of, but living in the Olympic Village makes it hard to perform,' she admitted in an interview after the race.\n\n'It's definitely not made for high performance, so it's about who can really keep it together in the mind.'\n\nFrench swimmer Touati, said: 'We had no AC in the bedroom but they installed it anyway because it was getting too hot.'\n\nAnd 20-year-old tennis star Gauff revealed that she was the only member of the American team still staying in the Olympic Village after her teammates fled to a hotel. She revealed 10 women were sharing two bathrooms in her corridor.\n\nMeanwhile, an Algerian rower, said: 'We have fans in the bedrooms, but that's not enough. It's too hot at night. We can't leave the windows open because of the mosquitoes -- too many mosquitoes.'\n\nAustralia, Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan, America and China had all installed air conditioning before the Games began, with AOC chief executive Matt Carroll saying: 'We appreciate the concept of not having air conditioning due to the carbon footprint' but added 'this is a high-performance Games. We're not going for a picnic.'\n\nThere's also been complaints over thievery within the complex, after a number of athletes reported missing items and no signs of break-ins.\n\nThe beds in the Olympic Village have also been the focus of controversy for their lack of comfort and their 'wokeness'.\n\nThe single beds, produced by Airwave, feature cardboard frames as part of the organisers' sustainability efforts.\n\nThe 'anti-sex' cardboard beds went down like a lead balloon with Aussie water polo star Tilly Kearns and teammate Gabi Palm, who said 'my back is about to fall off' after their first night.\n\nThere has been a drive towards sustainability at the Games, which is surely a positive given the increasing carbon footprint of global sport, yet the one drawback would appear to be the impact that is having on athletes' nutrition.\n\nA spokesperson for the Paris Olympics claimed that their partners have been working hard to 'adapt supplies' to the Olympic Village, with additional staff reportedly being employed in order to help the service run smoothly.\n\nPeaty's revelations about the Olympic Village come after he returned to the Olympics, having stepped away from swimming over mental health battles.\n\nBut following the men's 4x100m medley relay, he admitted that he would once more be taking a step back.\n\n'I think [I] have got to step away from the sport because it has just hurt too much this time, it really has,' said Peaty.\n\n'Tomorrow is never promised, so why worry?

We need to give the best we possibly can,\" Adam Peaty, who won a silver medal in the 100-meter breaststroke, said to Inews this week.\n\nPeaty said the food was excellent in other Olympic stops, like Tokyo and Rio. However, when talking about how Paris compared, Peaty was less than complimentary.\n\n\"But this time around ... there wasn't enough protein options, long queues, waiting 30 minutes for food because there's no queuing system,\" Peaty said. \"These [complaints] are for people to get better. And the organising committee, so we'll put these back to our team in full depth and detail.\"\n\nTo maintain his level of fitness and perform his best, Peaty says he likes to eat meat like he does at home and estimated that 60 percent of the meat served in Paris was meatless, and about 30 percent of all meals were plant-based.\n\nMORE: At Paris Games, athletes can't stop talking about food at Olympic Village\n\n\u27a4 Get Olympics updates in your texts!

Nutritionists and dozens of athletes were consulted on this plan, organizers said.\n\nPeaty said the plant-based options weren't suitable for many athletes.\n\n\"The narrative of sustainability has just been pushed on the athletes,\" he said. \"I want meat, I need meat to perform and that's what I eat at home, so why should I change?\"\n\n\"I like my fish and people are finding worms in the fish. It's just not good enough,\" added Peaty, who won silver in Paris in the 100-meter breaststroke.\n\nA Paris 2024 spokesperson told HuffPost it had no information to be able to confirm the worm allegation, and that Team Great Britain \"has confirmed that no such reports have been made to their staff.\"\n\nIt noted that \"there was never any question of placing the vegetarian objectives of Paris 2024's Food Vision on the athletes.\"\n\n\"We are listening to the athletes and take their feedback very seriously,\" the spokesperson said. \"Since the opening of the Village, our partner Sodexo Live! has been working proactively to adapt supplies to the growing use of the Olympic Village restaurants, as well as to the actual consumption by athletes observed over the first few days.\"\n\n\"As a result, the quantities of certain products have been significantly increased and additional staff have been deployed to ensure that the service runs smoothly.\"\n\nAndy Anson, the British Olympic Association's chief executive, said ahead of the opening ceremony that Team GB was enlisting another chef to supply its athletes with more appropriate food.\n\nAmerican gymnast Simone Biles said last week of the food, \"I don't think we're having proper French cuisine.\"\n\nHer teammate Hezly Rivera was even less enthusiastic.\n\n\"I don't think it's very good, at least what we're having in the dining hall,\" she said.\n\nHowever, at least a few people have been loving the fare.\n\nNorwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen has turned the Olympic Village's chocolate muffins into a viral sensation, rating them an \"insane 11/10.\"\n\nSodexo Live!, a multinational food services company, is charged with providing the tens of thousands of meals required each day for athletes in the Village.", "source": {"uri": "huffpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HuffPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label":

They later told the site that they had \"no information to be able to confirm the specific allegation\" from Peaty nor any reports of \"worms in food\" made to staff.\n\n\"The 550 dishes on offer in the Dining Hall were developed together with the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and the IOC over a period of more than a year,\" the Olympic Committee said, according to TMZ Sports. \"We always listen to the athletes and take their feedback very seriously.

He has revealed that athletes have found worms in the fish they have been served. Despite being a major favourite in the 100m breaststroke event, Peaty won the silver medal.\n\nAdam Peaty has torn into the Olympic village as he revealed that athletes had found worms in the fish they were being served during meals. The athlete hasn't had the best of times during the Paris 2024 Olympics. Sure, he's already won a medal, but it was only a silver. A silver is a great achievement for most, but heading into the 100m breaststroke event, Peaty was regarded as the favourite to win it all.\n\nShortly after, he tested positive for Covid. Despite his illness, he decided to compete in the men's 4x100m medley relay, but Great Britain missed out on a medal, finishing fourth. He then accused China of cheating in the event. Whether his struggles with Covid played a part in his performances remains to be seen, but it hasn't been a fun few weeks of competing for Peaty. Now, it seems he's not having a great time away from the swimming pools either.\n\nPeaty Has Slammed the Catering He doesn't think the standards are up to scratch\n\nOne of the most important things for any athlete is a healthy, nutritious diet. Eating the correct food is vital to keeping themselves in the best possible condition for competing in their chosen field. As a result, the Olympic village is expected to provide the gold standard of catering for athletes taking part as they prepare to compete.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that hasn't been the case in Paris. Peaty has slammed the standards of catering of the Olympic village this year and revealed that athletes have found worms in the fish they've been served. He also revealed, in an interview with the i paper, that they aren't serving any form of meat to the competitors and doesn't think the catering is at the level in which it has been at past Olympic games.\n\n\"The catering isn't good enough for the level the athletes are expected to perform. We need to give the best we possibly can. Tokyo, the food was incredible, Rio was incredible. But this time around [...] there wasn't enough protein options, long queues, waiting 30 minutes for food because there's no queuing system.\n\n\"The narrative of sustainability has just been punished on the athletes. I want to eat meat, I need meat to perform and that's what I eat at home, so why should I change? I like my fish and people are finding worms in the fish. It's just not good enough. The standard, we're looking at the best of the best in the world, and we're feeding them not the best.\"\n\nDespite the conditions seemingly being less than satisfactory for the athletes, it doesn't seem to have harmed Great Britain's Olympic aspirations too much, as the nation have had a very strong showing so far.\n\nGreat Britain Have Started the Olympics Strongly The nation has won 42 medals so far\n\nIt's been an impressive Olympic games so far for Great Britain. The nation has already won 42 medals, including 12 golds, and currently sit fifth in the rankings.

He compared the food at previous Olympics in Tokyo and Rio, which he found to be incredible, to the lackluster options in Paris.\n\nPeaty highlighted issues such as limited protein options, long queues, and even finding worms in the fish served at the Olympic Village. He emphasized the importance of providing top-quality nutrition to athletes who are competing at the highest level in the world.\n\nIn response to the concerns raised by Peaty and other athletes, Paris 2024 organizers stated that they are taking the feedback seriously and working to improve the situation. They mentioned that additional options are being provided, and efforts are being made to increase the quantities of certain products and ensure smoother service at the Olympic Village restaurants.\n\nDespite the challenges with the food quality, Peaty's performance in the 100m breaststroke was impressive, winning him a silver medal. As a two-time defending champion in the event from the Rio and Tokyo Olympics, Peaty continues to showcase his excellence in swimming.\n\nThe issue of food quality at the Olympic Village is crucial for athletes who rely on proper nutrition to fuel their performance. Ensuring that athletes have access to high-quality, nutritious meals is essential for their well-being and success during the Games. It is important for organizers to listen to the feedback from athletes like Peaty and make necessary improvements to meet the needs of competitors from around the world.\n\nAs the Paris Olympics continue, the focus on providing the best possible experience for athletes, including top-notch food options, remains a priority. The dedication and hard work of athletes like Adam Peaty deserve to be supported by ensuring they have access to the resources they need to perform at their best on the world stage.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaststroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Breaststroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Peaty", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Peaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://usanews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/news-06082024-185522.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794017", "eventUri": "eng-9794017", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

It's hard.\"\n\nCoach Jenny Meadows added: \"The BOA (British Olympic Association) have got a lodge 15 minutes from the village so she's been getting a lift across there to eat because it's a good bit better than village.\"\n\nThe BOA has transformed the Lyc\u00e9e Ren\u00e9 Auffray, a catering college in the Paris suburb of Clichy, into a bespoke base for its athletes, offering medical, science, nutrition, and performance analysis services.\n\nSome athletes have expressed concerns about the Olympic Village's catering on social media, posting negative food reviews on TikTok.\n\nFilipino American gymnast Aleah Finnegan complained that the food is \"not really seasoned\", while Emelia Chatfield, a track and field athlete representing Haiti, posted a clip in which she gave the canteen a 0/10 rating, describing it as \"disgusting\".\n\nOn Tuesday, six-time Olympic medallist Peaty criticised the quantity and quality of food available to athletes at the Olympic Village, claiming it could impact their performance.\n\n\"The catering isn't good enough for the level the athletes are expected to perform,\" the swimmer told . \"We need to give the best we possibly can.\n\n\"Tokyo the food was incredible.

There wasn't enough protein options, long queues, waiting 30 minutes for food because there's no queuing system.\"\n\nAs part of the Games' sustainability pledges organisers have aimed to make 60 per cent of all meals served meatless and a third plant-based, but Peaty said the commitment had made it harder to athletes to stick their normal diet.\n\n\"The narrative of sustainability has just been pushed on the athletes,\" he added. \"I want meat, I need meat to perform and that's what I eat at home, so why should I change?\n\n\"I like my fish and people are finding worms in the fish. It's just not good enough.\n\n\"The standard, we're looking at the best of the best in the world, and we're not feeding them the best.\"\n\nParis 2024's organisers have pushed back on his criticisms, saying they had \"no information to be able to confirm the specific allegation\" from Peaty.\n\nA spokesperson for the Games said that Team GB has confirmed that no reports of worms in food have been made to their staff.\n\nTeam GB hockey player Giselle Ansley has also voiced concerns about catering at the Olympic Village, which accommodates 14,250 athletes and serves up to 60,000 meals a day.\n\nShe told MailOnline: \"To start with [the food] was terrible. And there wasn't enough of it. There were turkey meat skewers that were not properly cooked and were raw in the middle. That's dangerous.\n\n\"They would run out of popular dishes and leave athletes with not enough to eat.\"\n\nShot putter Scott Lincoln was more forgiving, but admitted: \"It is a lot like school dinners.\"\n\nA day before the Games opened last month, reports emerged that athletes were already snubbing the Olympic village in favour of the nearby BOA base.\n\n\"At the beginning of every Games there's usually two or three issues - the big one this time is the food in the village, which is not adequate,\" Andy Anson, the Team GB chief executive, told The Times.\n\n\"There are not enough of certain foods: eggs, chicken, certain carbohydrates, and then there is the quality of the food, with raw meat being served to athletes. They have got to improve it over the next couple of days dramatically.\n\n\"Our athletes have decided they would rather go and eat in our performance lodge in Clichy, so we are having to get another chef to come over as the demand is far exceeding what we thought it would be.\"\n\nOn Monday, a Paris 2024 spokesperson said they were taking athletes' feedback \"very seriously\" and had made a number of changes to the supply of food to \"ensure that the service runs smoothly\" since the Games began.\n\nhas contacted the Paris Olympics for further comment.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk",

Additionally, as part of the Games' pledge to reduce the carbon footprint of meals produced by half, a strict quality charter was developed in anticipation of the Paris Olympics. A quarter of all ingredients are sourced in a 155-mile (250 km) radius of Paris and 20% are certified organic, BBC reported. Meat, milk and eggs are all from France and a third of the food is plant-based.\n\n\"The narrative of sustainability has just been pushed on the athletes,\" Peaty said. \"I want meat, I need meat to perform and that's what I eat at home, so why should I change?\"\n\nHe continued, \"I like my fish and people are finding worms in the fish.

The FDA notes that the \"safest route\" is to cook your seafood rather than consume it raw.\n\nRepresentatives for Paris 2024 did not respond to TODAY.com's request for comment on whether worms were found or reported in the fish served on-site.\n\nThe six-time Olympic medalist, who tied for silver with American Nic Fink in the 100-meter breaststroke, said his comments on the food and its quality were \"for people to get better.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Peaty did not immediately respond to TODAY.com's request for comment.\n\n\"\u2060We remind everyone that Paris 2024 catering operations are subject to regular inspections by the food safety authorities, and we have also contracted a private inspection company to carry out additional checks,\" a representative for Paris 2024 tells TODAY.com in an email, adding that they are aware of the Olympian's comments.\n\nThe organization says its priority is to meet the needs of athletes from around the world to enable them to compete at their best.\n\nRegarding food in Olympic Village, the representative says the 550 dishes on offer in the dining hall were developed together with the national Olympic committees and the IOC. The development, they say, took more than a year.\n\n\"We are listening to the athletes and take their feedback very seriously,\" the representative says. \"Since the opening of the Village, our partner Sodexo Live! has been working proactively to adapt supplies to the growing use of the Olympic Village restaurants, as well as to the actual consumption by athletes observed over the first few days.\"\n\nThere have been reports of food shortages at the Olympic Village, with Team GB telling French newspaper L'Equipe on July 24 that the cafeteria was rationing eggs. Many athletes have critiqued the offerings -- Simone Biles said she thought the \"healthier\" food in the cafeteria might not be \"proper French cuisine.\"\n\nSome athletes have chosen to skip the cafeteria offerings entirely: American swimmers Abbey Weitzeil and Phoebe Bacon cooked their own ham and cheese sandwiches on the roof of their athletes village building after calling the food hall \"scary.\"\n\nThe rest of Team GB also reportedly hired private chefs for their performance base in the Paris suburb Clichy. Andy Anson, chief of the British Olympic Association, told the Times of London on July 25 that there weren't \"enough of certain foods: eggs, chicken, certain carbohydrates,\" and also criticized the quality of the food, claiming that \"raw meat\" was being served to Olympians.\n\n\"They have got to improve it over the next couple of days dramatically,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Paris Olympics organizers said on July 29 they had rectified the early logistical issues with the supply chain.\n\nOn June 30, a spokesperson for Sodexo Live told TODAY.com that it had increased the

Team GB has confirmed that no such reports have been made to their staff. More generally, regarding food in the Village, our priority is to meet the needs of athletes from around the world to enable them to compete at their best. The 550 dishes on offer in the Dining Hall were developed together with the NOCs and the IOC over a period of more than a year.

We are listening to the athletes and take their feedback very seriously.\"\n\nAfter finishing fourth in the 4x100m medley relay on the final evening of the swimming meet, Peaty, 29, hit out at both the quantity and quality of the food.\n\n\"We need to give the best we possibly can,\" he told the i newspaper. \"Tokyo, the food was incredible, Rio was incredible.

As part of their extensive planning, the British Olympic Association had hired an entire catering college in nearby Clichy as a performance base and athletes including Hodgkinson have been snubbing the village in favour of the food cooked by the specialist Team GB chefs.\n\nOlympic organisers had boasted of Michelin chefs but athletes have complained of shortages and insufficient quality, prompting them to instead flock to the private British performance lodge which is full of supplies from Aldi and a team of on-site chefs overseen by the sports nutritionist Wendy Martinson.\n\nPeaty, 29, was in outspoken mood as he claimed the team had been \"blindsided\" by the challenges of living in the village. \"The catering isn't good enough for the level the athletes are expected to perform,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to give the best we possibly can. Tokyo, the food was incredible, Rio was incredible. But this time around [...] there wasn't enough protein options, long queues, waiting 30 minutes for food because there's no queuing system. These [complaints] are for people to get better. And the organising committee, so we'll put these back to our team in full depth and detail.

And it's pretty dire.\n\nWhile speaking with iNews on Tuesday, the 29-year-old, who won silver for Great Britain in the 100m breaststroke last month, made some jaw-dropping claims about the food the athletes are provided at the Olympic Village... And our advice? Stay away from the fish... Because \"people are finding worms\" in it!\n\nNo fishing way!\n\nSpeaking more about the gut-wrenching discoveries, he argued:\n\n\"It's just not good enough. We're looking at the best of the best in the world, and we're feeding them not the best. I just want people to get better at their roles and jobs. And I think that's what the athletes are the best sounding board for.\"\n\nSeriously! These people are expected to perform at nearly superhuman levels, but are being fed like THIS? Make it make sense!\n\nRelated: American Coach Kicked Out Of Paris Olympics Over Shocking Allegations Of Sexual Abuse!\n\nAdam said he and other Olympic athletes have been \"blindsided\" by the lapse in culinary care, adding:\n\n\"The catering isn't good enough for the level the athletes are expected to perform. We need to give the best we possibly can.\"\n\nThe swimmer also criticized the fact Olympic organizers initiated a goal to have 60 percent of all meals provided to athletes be vegetarian, and some even completely vegan. He argued:\n\n\"The narrative of sustainability has just been punished on the athletes. I want meat, I need meat to perform and that's what I eat at home, so why should I change?\"\n\nThat's valid... A huge part of these athletes' training process is diet, so why should they have to forgo their personal nutritional plan when it's really time to perform??\n\nAdam has previously competed in the Summer Games in Rio in 2016 and Tokyo in 2020, which he said had great meal options and organization in comparison to Paris:\n\n\"Tokyo, the food was incredible, Rio was incredible. But this time around, there wasn't enough protein options, long queues, waiting 30 minutes for food because there's no queuing system.\"\n\nHe told the outlet he's coming forward with his complaints \"for people to get better.\"\n\nA Paris spokesperson also spoke to iNews, ensuring they're taking the criticism \"very seriously\" and are working to \"ensure that the service runs smoothly\" -- though they said there has been \"no information to be able to confirm the specific allegation\" of the worms.\n\nWe really hope for the sake of all the athletes performing in the Summer Games this year that the food issue gets resolved!

And the sporting stars aren't holding back with their honest and somewhat scathing reviews of what's on offer, taking to social media to vent their thoughts.\n\nFrom 'unseasoned grub' to an obsession with the moreish chocolate muffins, it has been a mixed bag of reviews on the meals fuelling the world's top athletes. Stars from across the globe have weighed in on the debate, including Team GB swimming legend Adam Peaty, who slammed the meals as \"not good enough\" before claiming some of his fellow competitors have even found worms on their plates.\n\nPlaying host to the 2024 Games, France has committed to an environmentally friendly and low-carbon approach, including the use of cardboard beds in the rooms, a ban on air-con, and plenty of meat-free options in the dining hall. But silver medalist Peaty has slammed the menu for its apparent lack of high-protein options to keep up his endurance.\n\n\"The catering isn't good enough for the level the athletes are expected to perform. We need to give the best we possibly can,\" Adam Peaty told the i paper. \"Tokyo, the food was incredible, Rio was incredible. But this time around [...] there weren't enough protein options, long queues, waiting 30 minutes for food because there's no queuing system.\n\n\"The narrative of sustainability has just been punished on the athletes. I want to eat meat, I need meat to perform and that's what I eat at home, so why should I change?\" He added. The 29-year-old then claimed 'worms' had been found in the fish. But the six-time European swimmer of the year isn't the only one dishing out complaints.\n\nKeely Hodgkinson's coaches have also voiced their concerns over the village's offering and claimed there is a \"lack of veggies,\" which meant the 800m gold medallist only ate there once. Her team told the i newspaper that she had been going to the British Olympic Association base for her meals instead of eating at the Olympic Village as the food is a \"good bit better\". \"She had one meal there, the lack of veggies... it's just very difficult,\" said one of Hodgkinson's coaches, Trevor Painter.\n\nElsewhere, some British athletes have started taking packed lunches back to the village for their evening meal instead. USA track and field star Raven Saunders also made it clear on social media platform TikTok that she's not a fan.\n\nShe wrote in her video: \"Eating in the Olympics like...\" as she held up what looked to be a burnt piece of meat on a skewer, with the sound-over saying: \"You disappointed me\". She captioned the video: \"It's been a struggle.\"\n\nGymnast Aleah Finnegan, of the Philippines, took to TikTok to share her 'average' review of the food as she sat down with her tray. \"Honestly, the food is good. It's not really seasoned. There is a seasoning station over there. It's not bad, it's just pretty basic... It's pretty good, it's good food.\n\n\"It just probably needs some seasoning a little bit. Personal preference, that's me.\" Emelia Chatfield, a track and field athlete who represents Haiti, also posted a TikTok video where she gave the dining hall a scathing 0/10 rating, calling it \"disgusting,\" before admitting it can be a 2/10 \"on some days.\"\n\nHowever, some, including Henrik Christiansen, have raved about one particular item available, which has even led to a new identity for the Norwegian swimmer. After dedicating several videos solely to the Olympic Village chocolate muffin, he hilariously said in a TikTok video: \"I hereby declare myself as the Olympic muffin man.\"\n\nHe proudly gave the muffins an 11 out of 10 stars in a video on TikTok. He's since posted more muffin-related content with another of him caught lying in bed scoffing another of the desserts. He then revealed he stored at least four of the muffins in his drawers, before jokingly holding his hand up at the camera.\n\nUS gold medallist gymnast Simone Biles also raved about the French pastries on offer with a hilarious voiceover clip calling them \"spectacular\" as she chomped down on a pan au chocolat on camera. However, she also said during a press conference: \"I don't think we're having proper French cuisine in the Village like you guys might be eating because you're outside the Village.\"\n\nUS sprinter Anna Hall described the food as 'decent' and said: \"I'm a very picky eater, as I think a lot of the American team is. So I don't think it's our favourite. But we have a training site that the Americans go to, and they have different meals for us there, so it hasn't been hard to find food.\"\n\nMeanwhile the British Olympic Association's chief executive Andy Anson has made his thoughts clear on the matter. He told The Times that the food \"is not adequate\" and insisted it needs to be \"improved dramatically\".\n\n\"There are not enough of certain foods: eggs, chicken, certain carbohydrates, and then there is the quality of the food, with raw meat being served to athletes,\" he continued. \"Our athletes have decided they would rather go and eat in our performance lodge in Clichy, so we are having to get another chef to come over as the demand is far exceeding what we thought it would be.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Paris Olympics told the Mirror: \"Our priority is to meet the needs of athletes from around the world to enable them to compete at their best. With regard to food service in the Village, it should be remembered that the 550 dishes on offer in the Dining Hall were developed together with the NOCs and the IOC over a period of more than a year. Paris 2024 is proposing a Dining Hall with six different zones and four culinary themes in order to cater to the nutritional needs and eating habits of athletes from around the world: World cuisine, French cuisine, Asian cuisine and African-Caribbean cuisine.\n\n\"We are listening to the athletes and take their feedback very seriously. Since the opening of the Village, our partner Sodexo Live! has been working proactively to adapt supplies to the growing use of the Olympic Village restaurants, as well as to the actual consumption by athletes observed over the first few days. As a result, the quantities of certain products have been significantly increased and additional staff have been deployed to ensure that the service runs smoothly. Paris 2024 continues to liaise closely with the nutritionists of the National Olympic Committees and is ready to make any further adjustments needed to the food service.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share?

In between their competitions, the stars also soak in the typical activities associated with the games and living in the Olympic village. Some of them have discussed their experiences this year and, now, we can add another athlete to that list. British swimmer Adam Peaty opened up about his time competing in Paris and, while doing so, he made some serious allegations about the food that he and his colleagues have consumed. He even went as far as to say that there are \"worms in the fish,\" and yikes.\n\n29-year-old Adam Peaty - a celebrated British swimmer who won gold at the past two Summer Olympics - chronicled his dietary experiences with this year's games during an interview. He stated that he was \"blindsided\" by some of the elements he encountered while staying in the Olympic village, which houses the various athletes. But the true sticking point for Peaty seems to be the quality of the food he's been served this year. During his conversation with i, he alleged that the vittles he and others have been served are subpar and that gaining access to it hasn't been easy either:\n\nLater on, the six-time Olympic medal winner opened up about the specific nutrients that he's supposedly lacked enough of since the games began. He put firm emphasis on a supposed lack of meat in the village and, as previously mentioned, he claimed there's a parasitic problem:\n\nEarlier in the week, a representative for the Olympics reached out to i, saying that officials were taking the feedback from Adam Peaty and other athletes \"very seriously.\" An additional statement was shared after the publication of Peaty's interview, with organizers saying that they possessed \"no information to be able to confirm the specific allegation\" from the swimmer. It was also stressed that officials collaborated with team nutritionists in order to curate a menu that aligns with Paris' sustainability efforts. As part of that, the goal was for all meals in the village to be 60 percent meatless and a third to be plant-based. Still, as Peaty opined, that approach was not beneficial for some athletes' diets. That fish claim has yet to be backed up by other people, but it goes without saying that this assertion is admittedly unsettling.\n\nIt's been interesting to hear some of the competitors share their experiences amid the games as well as shed light on some of the more nuanced aspects of their sports. Team USA member Simone Biles, whose gymnastics wins are still streamable, discussed her own sport. In one instance, Biles opened up about why several gymnasts fell during this year's balance beam final. Stephen Nedoroscik, the viral Pommel Horse guy, has also been candid about his time at the games and also revealed the sweet reason for his viral ear tug.\n\nAnd, while Adam Peaty seemingly hasn't enjoyed every aspect of his stay in the Olympic village, he has had reason to celebrate as of late. Peaty managed to win silver in the 100 m breaststroke (which was one of the many streamable swimming events).

However, the most important aspect was overlooked: providing the right environment for elite athletes to perform at their best.\n\nThe Paris 2024 Olympic Village is a hive of activity and diversity, dreams and life stories, joys and sorrows, bringing together people from all over the world who practise sport and representing the most important multicultural gathering in the world, where interaction is constant as they compete in the thirty-third modern Olympic Games.\n\nIt is a living reflection of coexistence and the Olympic spirit in a huge \"mini-city\" spread over three different communes in Seine-Saint-Denis.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of the Village is the presence of impressive delegations such as those from the United States, Australia and France, easily identifiable by the flags hanging from their balconies, alongside smaller delegations. From America to Oceania, with stops in Europe, Asia and Africa, not forgetting the North and South Pole, everyone is there.\n\nSome of the smaller delegations are less visible. Security also plays an important role in the village. Israel has no external markings and keeps its doors closed, although its athletes wear uniforms like the others.\n\nAll delegations are housed in the same Village, except for those athletes who have opted out, such as the US basketball team, who preferred a central 5-star hotel for their athletes to rest in, due to the lack of air conditioning and very hard \"eco-friendly\" cardboard beds.\n\nThe United States and China are far apart. The same goes for the Refugee Olympic Team in relation to countries with exiles such as Afghanistan, Cuba or Iran. The rest are mixed together, as has generally been the case since the first Olympic Village was built exactly 100 years ago in Paris in 1924.\n\nThe small city has it all. From an official Paris 2024 merchandise store (with no price advantage over the one near the Place de la Concorde) to a Samsung store where every accredited athlete will receive a mobile phone.\n\nFrom 24-hour medical care, gyms, beauty and relaxation centres, virtual services and even a space for different religious practices. The 2024 Olympic Village has it all, including a free, alcohol-free bar for athletes to relax in their free time.\n\nThe use of bicycles is commonplace for getting around the vast Village, which spans three municipalities: Saint-Denis, Saint-Ouen and l'\u00cele-Saint-Denis, on the outskirts of Paris.\n\nSome of the bikes are human-powered, while others are technology-assisted and can be seen all over the Village. The idea was for athletes to get around on bikes as part of an attempt to make the Village the most sustainable and environmentally friendly in history.\n\nThe Belgian delegation in particular stood out with their yellow bikes that could be seen everywhere. They didn't want to face the problem many athletes have of not finding available bikes, as Argentinean Olympic BMX gold medallist Jose \"Maligno\" Torres commented to his country's media: \"The public bikes are not enough, so many athletes lock them up as if they were their own to prevent others from using them. Others take the bike away from those who do\".\n\nAlthough the organisation boasts an elite catering service managed by Sodexo Live, with 3,300 seats and 40,000 meals a day to meet the needs of more than 10,000 residents, with more than 500 recipes, including a selection of \"gastronomic\" menus served and imagined by star chefs such as Alexandre Mazzia and Akrame Benallal, the athletes do not share this view.\n\nNutrition is vital for top athletes, and the controversial decision to make it predominantly vegetarian with little animal protein \"to be more sustainable\" has not gone unnoticed. \"We all have problems with the food here in the village because they keep serving the same meals over and over again. There are long queues. I'd say the organisation of the food is quite strange,\" Maica Garcia Godoy, who plays centre forward for the Spanish water polo team, told Catalunya Radio in Spain.\n\nArgentine rugby sevens team coach Santiago Gomez Cora was equally critical of the organisation: \"It's trendy now to have no proteins, and the food is vegan or plant-based or whatever, and there were no proteins. We waited 40 minutes for a hamburger or whatever meat they served. Waiting 40 minutes is a lot for an elite athlete.\"\n\n\"The truth is that the organisation was not good. The transfers were not good.It was 35 degrees and there was no air conditioning because of cost-cutting and environmental concerns, and the truth is you can't sleep in 35 degrees. The guys didn't sleep the first two nights. There were eco-friendly fans that cooled less than nothing,\" the Argentine coach complained on Argentine television after finishing seventh at Paris 2024.\n\n\"That's why a lot of stars probably won't come to the Olympic Village. Argentina's building had no water for a whole day. The hockey girls had to move to another building because the toilet was overflowing with excrement. We spent a whole day going to the toilets in the dining hall. It's amazing that high performance sports organisations have such standards,\" said Gomez Cora.\n\nReturning to the subject of food, British swimmer Adam Peaty, a three-time Olympic gold medallist and eight-time world champion, was highly critical of the organisation of the third Olympic Games to be held on French soil.\n\n\"I like fish and people find worms in the fish. It's just not good enough,\" said the British swimmer in an interview published on Tuesday by the English newspaper and sports website i.\n\n\"In Tokyo the food was incredible, in Rio it was incredible. But this time... there weren't enough protein options, there were long queues, you had to wait 30 minutes for food because there was no queue system,\" Adam Peaty pointed out.\n\n\"The sustainability narrative ends up punishing the athletes. I want meat, I need meat to perform and that's what I eat at home, so why should I change?\" complained the 29-year-old swimmer, who was born in Uttoxeter.\n\nAccording to The Times, the head of the British Olympic Association, Andy Anson, mentioned that they had to call in private chefs as a contingency measure. \"There's a shortage of certain foods: eggs, chicken, certain carbohydrates, and then there's the quality of the food, with raw meat being served to athletes,\" Anson complained.\n\nEchoing the Argentine rugby coach, Olympic gold medallist Italian swimmer Thomas Ceccon said, \"There's no air conditioning in the village, it's hot, the food is bad. A lot of athletes move because of that. It's not an excuse, it's just a chronicle of what maybe not everyone knows.\"\n\nThe winner of the 100 metre backstroke was seen resting outside his room. His \"bed\" ended up being the ground in a park after he complained publicly about the accommodation. It could not be confirmed whether this was in the athletes' residence or somewhere in the city of France.\n\nAmerican tennis player Coco Gauff, ranked second in the world, not only complained but left the Village, claiming the rooms were \"too small\", as she noted in a TikTok video shared with her millions of followers.\n\nMeanwhile, French swimmer Assia Touati expressed his concern about the lack of air conditioning, while Australian water polo player Matilda Kearns posted on social media that she had \"already had a massage to repair the damage\" from sleeping on a mattress. Multiple gymnastics champion Simone Biles also joined the controversy, using her TikTok account to say that the beds \"suck\", although she did mention that her team had been given extra mattresses.\n\nIn short, the list of disgruntled athletes would make this note endless in relation to what was thought to be a modern, progressive, sustainable and eco-friendly Village versus the reality experienced by the athletes who saw their sleep and nutritional routines affected.\n\nDespite the problems, the athletes are trying to smile through the setbacks and taking the opportunity to visit iconic sites for photos, with the Olympic rings and the entrance to the dining hall building with flags from all the countries being favourite spots for athletes and staff to capture memories of their stay.\n\nIn their free time, some take advantage of the creative entrance to the Danish delegation, where there is a table for Lego building, an activity that has caught the attention of many athletes.\n\nAn unusual trend has also emerged from previous Games. A tattoo artist has set up shop in the Village and many athletes are opting for a permanent souvenir in the form of an Olympic rings tattoo.\n\nAs in life, everything mixes in an Olympic Games, and even more so in an Olympic Village, where athletes experience the pinnacle of glory or the frustration of defeat, without forgetting the great experience they have lived and will never forget.",

He shared: \"I actually like fish, however I noticed worms on this dish.\n\nThe meals on the 2024 Olympics will not be adequate. We wish to see the perfect requirements on the earth right here however sadly, it by no means seems.\"\n\nThe 2024 Olympic organizing committee has denied stories of worms in meals, however Adam Peaty will not be the primary athlete to talk out concerning the high quality of meals on the event.\n\nAdam Peaty admitted he was stunned by the poor organisation of the 2024 Olympics. The British swimmer added: \"The service will not be adequate. Athletes compete on the highest stage and sophistication. They count on the absolute best service.\n\nWe all the time attempt to give our greatest. The meals on the Tokyo Olympics was wonderful. In Rio, all the pieces was nice. However this time, we confronted meals with little protein. Many individuals needed to wait in lengthy strains, ready half-hour for meals.\n\nThese complaints are for no different function than to want us higher service. We hope the Organizing Committee will pay attention and enhance the scenario.\"\n\nIn keeping with one other athlete, two-thirds of the five hundred dishes served within the Olympic Village are vegetarian. For instance, the meat stew in crimson wine is produced from synthetic meat.\n\nPictures of meals rations on the Olympic village posted by Chinese language athletes on social media (Photograph: Sina).\n\nThe Paris Olympic Organizing Committee has strict high quality laws for meals. 1 / 4 of all substances are transported inside 250km of Paris.

And there wasn't enough of it.\n\n'There were turkey meat skewers that were not properly cooked and were raw in the middle. That's dangerous.\n\n'They would run out of popular dishes and leave athletes with not enough to eat.\n\n'When we have an event in the morning we come back and we need to eat to be prepared for the following day.\n\n'But after the caterers received a lot of criticism it has certainly got better.\n\n'I would score the food in the first few days at one-out-of-ten. Now I would say it is five-out-of-ten.'\n\nFellow TeamGB member Scott Lincoln, a shot-putter, was more positive about it but did say: 'It is a lot like school dinners.'\n\nBut he went on: 'We kind of expect that - the kitchens have to cater for 15,000 people so it is the only way they can do it.\n\nScott, 31, from Northallerton, said: 'To be honest it's fine. I go straight to the grill section, where I can always find chicken, turkey or tuna, which is what I need to eat to prepare for my events.\n\n'There is always a good variety of dishes. And I certainly have had a lot worse.\n\n'I would score the food six-and-a-half-out-of-ten.'\n\nSport Climber Lauren Mukheibir, 22, from South Africa, said the food was 'adequate' - but that she had not expected to be served high quality meals.\n\nShe said: 'My mother is a chef so I have grown up eating really good food.\n\n'I always head straight to the salad bar where I load up fresh produce and then I top it up with whatever protein is available.\n\n'So I'm pleased that it's not just pasta and rice.\n\n'However the vegetarian stuff does not look very appetising.\n\nShe added: 'Some of the competitors here Paris have the backing of huge sponsors and have very high expectations.\n\n'But I think they are being a bit snobby.\n\n'Having said that I would give the food in the Athletes' Village six-and-a-half out of ten.'\n\nOthers were more positive.\n\nFencer Blake Broszus, 23, from Canada, said he was satisfied with the quality and variety of the food on offer.\n\nHe said: 'There are a lot of different food stations, where you can get different types of food - grilled meat and fish, vegetarian, salad bar, Asian food, pasta and halal meals.\n\n'I usually go for some pasta, some meat skewers and salad. That certainly works for me.\n\n'I have no criticism of the food or any of the facilities that Paris has laid on for us. I think it's all been great.\n\n'I give it all seven-out-of-ten.'\n\nSprinter Milagros Duran, 23, from the Dominican Republic, said she was more than happy with the food in the Athletes' Village.\n\nShe said: 'There is everything I need - chicken, beef, pork. It's good. I have no complaints.\n\n'I score the food eight-out-of-ten.'\n\nModern Pentathlete Duilio Carrillo, 27, from Mexico, also scored the food highly.\n\nHe said: 'For me the food in the Athletes Village is very good, delicious. I want for nothing. I score it ten-out-of-ten.'\n\nSix-time Olympic medallist Peaty had said in an interview this week that the quality of food on offer was so poor that it could affect the performances of athletes.\n\n'The catering isn't good enough for the level the athletes are expected to perform,' he told the i. 'We need to give the best we possibly can. [In] Tokyo the food was incredible. Rio was incredible. But this time around? There wasn't enough protein options, long queues, waiting 30 minutes for food because there's no queueing system.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast

You'd think the Olympic Village, where the athletes stay, would have some of the highest-quality foods out there, but according to one athlete, we may be mistaken.\n\nBefore the games began, there were already some red flags, one being that the cafeteria at the Olympic Village reportedly had a shortage of proteins like chicken and eggs.

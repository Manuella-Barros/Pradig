They said representatives of the Wolobah family were set to attend.\n\n\"The Wolobahs hope that this case, which could have national and even international implications, will send a message to all who would market dangerous products, especially utilizing social media, to children,\" the statement said.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear who would be named in the lawsuit.\n\nPaqui pulled the product from store shelves shortly after Harris' death. After the findings of the autopsy were released in May, the company, a subsidiary of Hershey Co., released this statement, noting the product was labeled as being for adults only:\n\nWe were and remain deeply saddened by the death of Harris Wolobah and extend our condolences to his family and friends. Paqui's One Chip Challenge was intended for adults only, with clear and prominent labeling highlighting that the product was not for children or anyone sensitive to spicy foods or with underlying health conditions. We saw increased reports of teens and other individuals not heeding these warnings.\u202fAs a result, while the product adhered to food safety standards, out of an abundance of caution, we worked with retailers to voluntarily remove the product from shelves in September 2023, and the One Chip Challenge has been discontinued.\n\nNBC10 Boston reached out to Paqui after the lawyers' announcement Wednesday.\n\nIn their statement Wednesday, Sheff & Cook lawyers said the chip was easy to purchase at a Walgreens in the Worcester area, and Harris died within hours of consuming it.\n\nBefore the autopsy's results were filed, Harris' mother had confirmed to NBC10 Boston that the family believed he died of complications from the One Chip Challenge.\n\nThe autopsy also said that Wolobah had cardiomegaly, meaning an enlarged heart, and a congenital defect described as \"myocardial bridging of the left anterior descending coronary artery.\"\n\nA myocardial bridge occurs when a segment of a major artery of the heart runs within the heart muscle instead of on its surface, according to Dr. James Udelson, chief of cardiology at Tufts Medical Center.\n\n\"It is possible that with significant stimulation of the heart, the muscle beyond the bridge suddenly had abnormal blood flow ('ischemia') and could have been a cause of a severe arrhythmia,\" Udelson told The Associated Press in an email at the time. \"There have been reports of acute toxicity with capsaicin causing ischemia of the heart muscle.\"\n\nLarge doses of capsaicin can increase how the heart squeezes, putting extra pressure on the artery, noted Dr. Syed Haider, a cardiologist at MedStar Washington Hospital Center.\n\nBut while the autopsy results suggest that a heart defect probably made Harris more vulnerable to the negative effects of the chile pepper extract, people without underlying risk factors can also experience serious heart problems from ingesting large amounts of capsaicin, Haider said.\n\nUdelson and Haider both spoke in general terms; neither was involved in Harris' case.\n\nThe cause of Harris' death was determined on Feb. 27, and a death certificate was released to the Worcester city clerk's office on March 5, according to Elaine Driscoll, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security. The state only released the cause and manner of death. Officials will not release a full report, which is not considered part of the public record, she said.\n\nThe Paqui chip, sold individually for about $10, came wrapped in foil in a coffin-shaped box containing the warning that it was intended for the \"vengeful pleasure of intense heat and pain.\" The warning noted that the chip was for adult consumption only, and should be kept out of the reach of children.\n\nDespite the warning, children had no problem buying the chips, and there had been reports from around the country of teens who got sick after taking part in the chip-eating challenge. Among them were three California high school students who were taken to a hospital and seven students in Minnesota who were treated by paramedics after taking part in the challenge in 2022.\n\nHarris' death spurred warnings from Massachusetts authorities and physicians, who cautioned that eating such spicy foods can have unintended consequences. Since the chip fad emerged, poison control centers have warned that the concentrated amount could cause allergic reactions, trouble breathing, irregular heartbeats and even heart attacks or strokes.\n\nThe challenge called for participants to eat the Paqui chip and then see how long they could go without consuming other food and water. Sales of the chip seemed largely driven by people posting videos on social media of them or their friends taking the challenge. They showed people, including children, unwrapping the packaging, eating the chips and then reacting to the heat. Some videos showed people gagging, coughing and begging for water.", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They said representatives of the Wolobah family were set to attend.\n\n\"The Wolobahs hope that this case, which could have national and even international implications, will send a message to all who would market dangerous products, especially utilizing social media, to children,\" the statement said.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear who would be named in the lawsuit.\n\nPaqui pulled the product from store shelves shortly after Harris' death. After the findings of the autopsy were released in May, the company, a subsidiary of Hershey Co., released this statement, noting the product was labeled as being for adults only:\n\nWe were and remain deeply saddened by the death of Harris Wolobah and extend our condolences to his family and friends. Paqui's One Chip Challenge was intended for adults only, with clear and prominent labeling highlighting that the product was not for children or anyone sensitive to spicy foods or with underlying health conditions. We saw increased reports of teens and other individuals not heeding these warnings.\u202fAs a result, while the product adhered to food safety standards, out of an abundance of caution, we worked with retailers to voluntarily remove the product from shelves in September 2023, and the One Chip Challenge has been discontinued.\n\nThe company shared the statement in response to a request for comment from NBC10 Boston on Wednesday.\n\nIn their statement Wednesday, Sheff & Cook lawyers said the chip was easy to purchase at a Walgreens in the Worcester area, and Harris died within hours of consuming it.\n\nBefore the autopsy's results were filed, Harris' mother had confirmed to NBC10 Boston that the family believed he died of complications from the One Chip Challenge.\n\nThe autopsy also said that Wolobah had cardiomegaly, meaning an enlarged heart, and a congenital defect described as \"myocardial bridging of the left anterior descending coronary artery.\"\n\nA myocardial bridge occurs when a segment of a major artery of the heart runs within the heart muscle instead of on its surface, according to Dr. James Udelson, chief of cardiology at Tufts Medical Center.\n\n\"It is possible that with significant stimulation of the heart, the muscle beyond the bridge suddenly had abnormal blood flow ('ischemia') and could have been a cause of a severe arrhythmia,\" Udelson told The Associated Press in an email at the time. \"There have been reports of acute toxicity with capsaicin causing ischemia of the heart muscle.\"\n\nLarge doses of capsaicin can increase how the heart squeezes, putting extra pressure on the artery, noted Dr. Syed Haider, a cardiologist at MedStar Washington Hospital Center.\n\nBut while the autopsy results suggest that a heart defect probably made Harris more vulnerable to the negative effects of the chile pepper extract, people without underlying risk factors can also experience serious heart problems from ingesting large amounts of capsaicin, Haider said.\n\nUdelson and Haider both spoke in general terms; neither was involved in Harris' case.\n\nThe cause of Harris' death was determined on Feb. 27, and a death certificate was released to the Worcester city clerk's office on March 5, according to Elaine Driscoll, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security. The state only released the cause and manner of death. Officials will not release a full report, which is not considered part of the public record, she said.\n\nThe Paqui chip, sold individually for about $10, came wrapped in foil in a coffin-shaped box containing the warning that it was intended for the \"vengeful pleasure of intense heat and pain.\" The warning noted that the chip was for adult consumption only, and should be kept out of the reach of children.\n\nDespite the warning, children had no problem buying the chips, and there had been reports from around the country of teens who got sick after taking part in the chip-eating challenge. Among them were three California high school students who were taken to a hospital and seven students in Minnesota who were treated by paramedics after taking part in the challenge in 2022.\n\nHarris' death spurred warnings from Massachusetts authorities and physicians, who cautioned that eating such spicy foods can have unintended consequences. Since the chip fad emerged, poison control centers have warned that the concentrated amount could cause allergic reactions, trouble breathing, irregular heartbeats and even heart attacks or strokes.\n\nThe challenge called for participants to eat the Paqui chip and then see how long they could go without consuming other food and water. Sales of the chip seemed largely driven by people posting videos on social media of them or their friends taking the challenge. They showed people, including children, unwrapping the packaging, eating the chips and then reacting to the heat. Some videos showed people gagging, coughing and begging for water.", "source": {"uri": "nbcphiladelphia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC10 Philadelphia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Capsaicin is the component that gives chile peppers their heat.\n\nThe autopsy also said Harris had cardiomegaly, meaning an enlarged heart, and a congenital defect described as \"myocardial bridging of the left anterior descending coronary artery.\"\n\nPaqui, a Texas-based subsidiary of the Hershey Co., expressed its sadness about Wolobah's death but also cited the chip's \"clear and prominent labeling highlighting that the product was not for children or anyone sensitive to spicy foods or with underlying health conditions.\"\n\nThe Paqui chip, sold individually for about $10, came wrapped in foil in a coffin-shaped box containing the warning that it was intended for the \"vengeful pleasure of intense heat and pain.\" The warning noted that the chip was for adult consumption only, and should be kept out of the reach of children.\n\nDespite the warning, children had no problem buying the chips, and there had been reports from around the country of teens who got sick after taking part in the chip-eating challenge. Among them were three California high school students who were taken to a hospital and seven students in Minnesota who were treated by paramedics after taking part in the challenge in 2022.\n\nThe challenge called for participants to eat the Paqui chip and then see how long they could go without consuming other food and water. Sales of the chip seemed largely driven by people posting videos on social media of them or their friends taking the challenge. They showed people, including children, unwrapping the packaging, eating the chips and then reacting to the heat. Some videos showed people gagging, coughing and begging for water.\n\nHarris' death spurred warnings from Massachusetts authorities and physicians, who cautioned that eating such spicy foods can have unintended consequences. Since the chip fad emerged, poison control centers have warned that the concentrated amount could cause allergic reactions, trouble breathing, irregular heartbeats and even heart attacks or strokes.",

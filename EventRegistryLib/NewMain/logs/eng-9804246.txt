They unfortunately lost DeMar DeRozan in free agency. They traded away Alex Caruso -- a popular player among Chicago fans. And they have been linked to rumors about working hard to move Zach LaVine and Nikola Vucevic.\n\nAlso Read: Where do the Chicago Bulls land in our latest NBA power rankings?\n\nHowever, as the team gets closer to training camp in September, the point guard spot will be a major story once again. With former lottery pick Lonzo Ball leading the offense in 2021-22, Chicago was one of the surprise teams in the league and a force. However, once he went down with a knee injury he could never recover from, the Bulls spiraled over the next two and a half seasons.\n\nThey never properly replaced Ball due to hopes that he would eventually return. Well, after not playing in a game since early in 2022, the 26-year-old may finally return this season.\n\n\"The Bulls confirmed that Ball has started playing in full-contact 5-on-5 scrimmages -- as he was scheduled to do once August arrived -- and, according to one source, has done so with no setbacks,\" the Chicago Sun-Times reported this week.\n\nWhile Ball seems to be nearing a return to game action, the gifted point guard is not expected to retake his role as the leader of the starter unit.\n\nIn the trade for Caruso, the Chicago Bulls acquired 2021 lottery pick Josh Giddey. And the Sun-Times claims the versatile swingman is expected to be their lead ball-handler in the new season, not Ball.\n\n\"A team source reiterated that the Bulls were all in on Giddey as the primary ball handler from the moment they acquired him in the Alex Caruso trade with the Thunder,\" the outlet reported. \"They view him as Lonzo Ball-light.

Ball had tremendously improved his three-point shooting from when he first started in the league and became a very nice two-way player on the floor. Unfortunately, Lonzo Ball only played 35 games before getting injured, and now, he has an incredibly long way to becoming that player again.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJJ Redick Fires Back at Former NBA Star Over Viral Michael Jordan Statement", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "farbod_esnaashari@si.com", "name": "Farbod Esnaashari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonzo_Ball", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lonzo Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sun-Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3550,h_1996,x_0,y_171/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/bulls_news/01j4qbf7v4x2xradbpaj.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804246", "eventUri": "eng-9804246", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-01-", "textStart": 208, "textEnd": 218}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

From players returning after significant injuries to those looking to revive their careers, these are the players to keep an eye on.\n\nAs the new NBA season approaches, several players are gearing up for potentially career-defining comebacks. Lonzo Ball, who hasn't played since January 2022 due to a series of knee surgeries, is aiming to make his long-awaited return to the Chicago Bulls. Meanwhile, Ben Simmons is looking to bounce back with the Brooklyn Nets after an injury-plagued season that saw him play only 15 games. These comeback stories are among the most anticipated as we head into the 2024-25 NBA season.\n\n1. Lonzo Ball\n\nLonzo Ball's return to the NBA is one of the most anticipated storylines of the 2024-25 season. After missing over two years due to severe knee injuries, Ball exercised his $21.4 million player option for the upcoming season, signaling his intent to make a comeback with the Chicago Bulls. This decision is crucial, as it represents not only a personal milestone for Ball but also a significant opportunity for him to prove that he can still contribute at a high level in the league.\n\nThe Bulls' roster has undergone a dramatic transformation during Ball's absence. DeMar DeRozan was traded to the Sacramento Kings, and Alex Caruso was sent to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Meanwhile, the team acquired Josh Giddey, who is expected to take over primary ball-handling duties. This shift places Ball in a new context, where his role will be crucial in complementing Giddey and possibly helping to elevate the play of Zach LaVine, who remains on the trade block alongside Nikola Vucevic.\n\nBall's return could significantly impact the Bulls' strategy moving forward. If he can regain his form, he might become a central figure in Chicago's backcourt, especially if the team successfully moves LaVine and Vucevic. Ball's ability to distribute the ball and play elite defense could make him a valuable asset for the Bulls, both in the short term and as a potential trade piece before the deadline. Moreover, a successful comeback could lead to Ball securing a decent contract in free agency next summer, reestablishing his value in the league after such a prolonged absence.\n\nThe stakes are high for both Ball and the Bulls. For Ball, this season is about proving that he can still play at an elite level after multiple surgeries and a long recovery. For the Bulls, his return offers a glimmer of hope in what has been a challenging rebuild. If Ball can stay healthy and contribute, it could not only revive his career but also play a pivotal role in the Bulls' future plans.\n\n2. Ja Morant\n\nJa Morant's 2023-24 season was nothing short of a rollercoaster. After his 25-game suspension, Morant returned to the Grizzlies, determined to make an impact. He started strong, averaging 25.1 points, 8.1 assists, and 5.6 rebounds over 9 games, showing glimpses of his All-Star form. But just as things seemed to be looking up, he suffered a serious right shoulder injury in January. This injury required surgery, and it was a massive blow, not just to Morant, but to the Grizzlies as a whole.\n\nThe Grizzlies, who were already struggling with consistency, couldn't recover from losing their star player. They ended the season with a 27-55 record, falling well short of the playoffs. This was a stark reminder of how crucial Morant is to their success. Fast forward to August, and Morant is on the comeback trail. He's been cleared for all basketball activities and is working his way back to full strength.\n\nMorant's return isn't just about putting up numbers again; it's about redemption and growth. He's had to navigate not just physical recovery but also the mental and emotional toll of the past year's controversies and setbacks. This season, more than ever, is about proving that he can lead the Grizzlies not just to wins, but to a culture of accountability and resilience.\n\nAs the 2024-25 season looms, all eyes will be on Morant. Can he stay healthy? Can he lead the Grizzlies back to the playoffs in a tough Western Conference? These questions will define the season, and Morant's legacy could hinge on the answers. But one thing's for sure -- if anyone can bounce back from a year like the one he's had, it's Ja Morant.\n\n3. LaMelo Ball\n\nLaMelo Ball's 2023-24 season was another chapter of brilliance overshadowed by misfortune. Playing in just 22 games before an ankle injury ended his season prematurely, Ball showcased his talent by averaging 23.9 points, 8.0 assists, and 5.1 rebounds per game. His dynamic play was a bright spot in an otherwise bleak season for the Charlotte Hornets, who struggled mightily without their star, finishing with a 21-61 record.\n\nBall is now cleared to resume full basketball activities and is preparing for the upcoming season. The Hornets are banking on his return to lead a turnaround after such a difficult year. However, there are legitimate concerns about his ability to stay healthy over the long haul. Given his history with injuries, the 2024-25 season is a pivotal moment for Ball to prove that he can maintain his performance throughout an entire season and guide the Hornets back to respectability.\n\nThis season will be crucial for LaMelo, as he not only aims to stay healthy but also to fulfill his potential as the cornerstone of the Hornets' franchise. His performance will be closely watched, as both fans and the organization hope that he can finally enjoy an injury-free season and lead Charlotte to a much-needed resurgence in the league.\n\n4. Klay Thompson\n\nKlay Thompson's 2024-25 season marks a significant transition in his storied NBA career. After spending 13 years with the Golden State Warriors, Thompson made a high-profile move to the Dallas Mavericks in a sign-and-trade deal, signing a three-year, $50 million contract. This move comes after a 2023-24 season where Thompson averaged 17.9 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 2.3 assists over 77 games. While these numbers were solid, they marked a slight decline from his peak years, reflecting his adjustment to changes within the Warriors' roster and system.\n\nThompson's decision to join the Mavericks is driven by a desire to continue competing at a high level and to bring his championship experience to a team that came close to winning it all last season. The Mavericks reached the NBA Finals in 2024, ultimately falling short against the Boston Celtics. Thompson is expected to be a key piece in helping Dallas get back to the Finals and secure a championship.\n\nIn Dallas, Thompson will not only be relied upon for his elite shooting and spacing but also for his veteran leadership alongside Luka Doncic. The Mavericks are banking on his experience to help them overcome the final hurdles in their quest for a title.\n\nThis season is crucial for Thompson as he seeks to prove that he can still be a major contributor to a championship contender in a new environment. The pressure is on for both him and the Mavericks to make this partnership successful and achieve the ultimate goal of winning an NBA.\n\n5. Ben Simmons\n\nBen Simmons is entering a critical juncture in his career as the 2024-25 season begins. After several years of injuries, inconsistent play, and mental health challenges, Simmons is facing what could be a make-or-break season. The 2024-25 campaign marks the final year of his five-year, $177 million contract, which he initially signed with the Philadelphia 76ers before being traded to the Brooklyn Nets. This means that Simmons is essentially playing for his future in the NBA, as his performance this season will likely determine whether he secures another significant contract or potentially sees his career take a sharp decline.\n\nThe 2023-24 season was particularly difficult for Simmons. He was limited to just 15 games due to a nerve impingement in his back, an injury that required a microscopic partial discectomy in March 2024. When he did play, Simmons struggled, averaging just 6.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 5.7 assists per game -- far below his career averages. His inability to stay on the court and contribute consistently has raised serious concerns about his long-term viability in the league.\n\nWith only one year left on his contract, the stakes couldn't be higher for Simmons. If he can stay healthy and regain some of the form that made him a two-time All-Star and a Defensive Player of the Year candidate, there's still hope that he could revive his career and secure a new contract, whether with the Nets or another team. However, if his struggles continue -- whether due to lingering injuries or confidence issues -- Simmons could find himself out of the league sooner than anyone would have expected just a few years ago.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets, who are in the midst of a rebuild, are cautiously optimistic about Simmons' recovery and potential contribution. General Manager Sean Marks has indicated that Simmons is on track to be ready for the start of the season, but there's no doubt that the pressure is on. This season could define Simmons' legacy, either as a player who overcame significant adversity to reclaim his place among the NBA's elite or as a cautionary tale of unfulfilled potential.", "source":

His career has been a disappointment due to injury, not his level of talent.\n\nBall was taken No. 2 overall by the Lakers in the 2017 NBA Draft, with high hopes of becoming the next star for Los Angeles. He was ultimately shipped to New Orleans when the team acquired star Anthony Davis and proceeded to play with the Pelicans for two seasons.\n\nHe then signed with the Chicago Bulls in a sign-and-trade, linking up with Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan. Chicago looked like one of the better teams across the NBA but then disaster struck.\n\nBall suffered an injury to his knee and was ruled out for the remainder of the season. He underwent surgery before the start of the 2022-23 season and hasn't returned to play in any games due to multiple setbacks.\n\nThere had been hope for Ball to finally make his return this coming season and we now have even more optimism about it happening.\n\nJoe Cowley of the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Ball started playing scrimmages and has seen no setback while doing so. Ball was scheduled to start playing 5-on-5 in August and has seemed to be able to stay on schedule.\n\n\"The Bulls confirmed Ball has started playing in full-contact 5-on-5 scrimmages -- as he was scheduled to do once August arrived -- and, according to one source, has done so with no setbacks.\"\n\nBack in July, Bulls head coach Billy Donovan provided an update on Ball, leading up to these scheduled scrimmages.\n\n\"Hopefully we can get Lonzo back,\" Donovan said, during an interview with Frank Isola, Amin Elhassan, and Ryan McDonough of Sirius XM NBA Radio. \"He's moving closer... he's a guy that everyone enjoys playing with and I think the same can be said for Josh.\"\n\nIf Ball can return, it would be a welcome sight for all around the NBA. He had just started to enter into his prime before the injury, shooting a career-high 42.3 percent from beyond the 3-point line.\n\nThe Bulls will likely be cautious with the former Laker but this is a very promising sign.

Here is the exact excerpt from Cowley's article.\n\n\"A team source reiterated that the Bulls were all in on Giddey as the primary ball handler from the moment they acquired him in the Alex Caruso trade with the Thunder,\" Cowley said. \"They view him as Lonzo Ball-light -- a point guard with positional height to not only rebound, but also to attack the opposing defense with his ability to get the ball quickly up the floor by keeping his own dribble or delivering uncanny outlet passes.\"\n\nLonzo Ball has not played a game for the Chicago Bulls since January 2022.

Lonzo Ball, who hasn't played since January 2022 due to a series of knee surgeries, is aiming to make his long-awaited return to the Chicago Bulls. Meanwhile, Ben Simmons is looking to bounce back with the Brooklyn Nets after an injury-plagued season that saw him play only 15 games. These comeback stories are among the most anticipated as we head into the 2024-25 NBA season.\n\n1. Lonzo Ball\n\nLonzo Ball's return to the NBA is one of the most anticipated storylines of the 2024-25 season. After missing over two years due to severe knee injuries, Ball exercised his $21.4 million player option for the upcoming season, signaling his intent to make a comeback with the Chicago Bulls. This decision is crucial, as it represents not only a personal milestone for Ball but also a significant opportunity for him to prove that he can still contribute at a high level in the league.\n\nThe Bulls' roster has undergone a dramatic transformation during Ball's absence. DeMar DeRozan was traded to the Sacramento Kings, and Alex Caruso was sent to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Meanwhile, the team acquired Josh Giddey, who is expected to take over primary ball-handling duties. This shift places Ball in a new context, where his role will be crucial in complementing Giddey and possibly helping to elevate the play of Zach LaVine, who remains on the trade block alongside Nikola Vucevic.\n\nBall's return could significantly impact the Bulls' strategy moving forward. If he can regain his form, he might become a central figure in Chicago's backcourt, especially if the team successfully moves LaVine and Vucevic. Ball's ability to distribute the ball and play elite defense could make him a valuable asset for the Bulls, both in the short term and as a potential trade piece before the deadline. Moreover, a successful comeback could lead to Ball securing a decent contract in free agency next summer, reestablishing his value in the league after such a prolonged absence.\n\nThe stakes are high for both Ball and the Bulls. For Ball, this season is about proving that he can still play at an elite level after multiple surgeries and a long recovery. For the Bulls, his return offers a glimmer of hope in what has been a challenging rebuild. If Ball can stay healthy and contribute, it could not only revive his career but also play a pivotal role in the Bulls' future plans.\n\n2. Ja Morant\n\nJa Morant's 2023-24 season was nothing short of a rollercoaster. After his 25-game suspension, Morant returned to the Grizzlies, determined to make an impact. He started strong, averaging 25.1 points, 8.1 assists, and 5.6 rebounds over 9 games, showing glimpses of his All-Star form. But just as things seemed to be looking up, he suffered a serious right shoulder injury in January. This injury required surgery, and it was a massive blow, not just to Morant, but to the Grizzlies as a whole.\n\nThe Grizzlies, who were already struggling with consistency, couldn't recover from losing their star player. They ended the season with a 27-55 record, falling well short of the playoffs. This was a stark reminder of how crucial Morant is to their success. Fast forward to August, and Morant is on the comeback trail. He's been cleared for all basketball activities and is working his way back to full strength.\n\nMorant's return isn't just about putting up numbers again; it's about redemption and growth. He's had to navigate not just physical recovery but also the mental and emotional toll of the past year's controversies and setbacks. This season, more than ever, is about proving that he can lead the Grizzlies not just to wins, but to a culture of accountability and resilience.\n\nAs the 2024-25 season looms, all eyes will be on Morant. Can he stay healthy? Can he lead the Grizzlies back to the playoffs in a tough Western Conference? These questions will define the season, and Morant's legacy could hinge on the answers. But one thing's for sure -- if anyone can bounce back from a year like the one he's had, it's Ja Morant.\n\nRelated: Ja Morant's Agent: \"Ja Is Coming For The Work This Year...\"\n\n3. LaMelo Ball\n\nLaMelo Ball's 2023-24 season was another chapter of brilliance overshadowed by misfortune. Playing in just 22 games before an ankle injury ended his season prematurely, Ball showcased his talent by averaging 23.9 points, 8.0 assists, and 5.1 rebounds per game. His dynamic play was a bright spot in an otherwise bleak season for the Charlotte Hornets, who struggled mightily without their star, finishing with a 21-61 record.\n\nBall is now cleared to resume full basketball activities and is preparing for the upcoming season. The Hornets are banking on his return to lead a turnaround after such a difficult year. However, there are legitimate concerns about his ability to stay healthy over the long haul. Given his history with injuries, the 2024-25 season is a pivotal moment for Ball to prove that he can maintain his performance throughout an entire season and guide the Hornets back to respectability.\n\nThis season will be crucial for LaMelo, as he not only aims to stay healthy but also to fulfill his potential as the cornerstone of the Hornets' franchise. His performance will be closely watched, as both fans and the organization hope that he can finally enjoy an injury-free season and lead Charlotte to a much-needed resurgence in the league.\n\n4. Klay Thompson\n\nKlay Thompson's 2024-25 season marks a significant transition in his storied NBA career. After spending 13 years with the Golden State Warriors, Thompson made a high-profile move to the Dallas Mavericks in a sign-and-trade deal, signing a three-year, $50 million contract. This move comes after a 2023-24 season where Thompson averaged 17.9 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 2.3 assists over 77 games. While these numbers were solid, they marked a slight decline from his peak years, reflecting his adjustment to changes within the Warriors' roster and system.\n\nThompson's decision to join the Mavericks is driven by a desire to continue competing at a high level and to bring his championship experience to a team that came close to winning it all last season. The Mavericks reached the NBA Finals in 2024, ultimately falling short against the Boston Celtics. Thompson is expected to be a key piece in helping Dallas get back to the Finals and secure a championship.\n\nIn Dallas, Thompson will not only be relied upon for his elite shooting and spacing but also for his veteran leadership alongside Luka Doncic. The Mavericks are banking on his experience to help them overcome the final hurdles in their quest for a title.\n\nThis season is crucial for Thompson as he seeks to prove that he can still be a major contributor to a championship contender in a new environment. The pressure is on for both him and the Mavericks to make this partnership successful and achieve the ultimate goal of winning an NBA.\n\n5. Ben Simmons\n\nBen Simmons is entering a critical juncture in his career as the 2024-25 season begins. After several years of injuries, inconsistent play, and mental health challenges, Simmons is facing what could be a make-or-break season. The 2024-25 campaign marks the final year of his five-year, $177 million contract, which he initially signed with the Philadelphia 76ers before being traded to the Brooklyn Nets. This means that Simmons is essentially playing for his future in the NBA, as his performance this season will likely determine whether he secures another significant contract or potentially sees his career take a sharp decline.\n\nThe 2023-24 season was particularly difficult for Simmons. He was limited to just 15 games due to a nerve impingement in his back, an injury that required a microscopic partial discectomy in March 2024. When he did play, Simmons struggled, averaging just 6.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 5.7 assists per game -- far below his career averages. His inability to stay on the court and contribute consistently has raised serious concerns about his long-term viability in the league.\n\nWith only one year left on his contract, the stakes couldn't be higher for Simmons. If he can stay healthy and regain some of the form that made him a two-time All-Star and a Defensive Player of the Year candidate, there's still hope that he could revive his career and secure a new contract, whether with the Nets or another team. However, if his struggles continue -- whether due to lingering injuries or confidence issues -- Simmons could find himself out of the league sooner than anyone would have expected just a few years ago.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets, who are in the midst of a rebuild, are cautiously optimistic about Simmons' recovery and potential contribution. General Manager Sean Marks has indicated that Simmons is on track to be ready for the start of the season, but there's no doubt that the pressure is on. This season could define Simmons' legacy, either as a player who overcame significant adversity to reclaim his place among the NBA's elite or as a cautionary tale of unfulfilled potential.\n\nRelated:

The Bulls wish they had that answer.\n\nBall hasn't played in an NBA game since Jan. 14, 2022. That's just under 940 days. He's undergone three left knee surgeries since, including an experimental cartilage transplant in which he was given a new meniscus. By the way, a procedure that no professional athlete has returned from.\n\nYet, Ball spent the summer ramping up his basketball activity to one-on-ones, two-on-twos, and now five-on-fives, but that doesn't mean all the hurdles have been cleared.\n\nHe not only has to get his legs back to NBA conditioning, but also show that he can handle the pounding of NBA basketball for an extended period of time. And even if he passes those tests, in all likelihood he will still enter the 2024-25 regular season backing up Josh Giddey with strict minutes restrictions expected.\n\nWhat the Bulls and Ball can both hope for?\n\nHe shows enough value to draw trade interest entering the final season of a four-year deal that will pay him $21.4 million. That's because his future as a Bull beyond that is murky at best.\n\nA team source reiterated that the organization was all in on Giddey as the primary ball-handler from the moment they acquired him in the Alex Caruso trade with Oklahoma City. They view him as Lonzo Ball-light - a point guard with positional height to not only rebound, but attack the opposing defense with his ability to get the ball quickly up the floor by keeping his own dribble or uncanny outlet passing.\n\nSome of that was on display at the Olympics with Bulls front office eyes in Paris to watch him.\n\nRunning the show for Australia, the 6-foot-8, 21-year-old averaged 17.5 points, 7.8 rebounds and six assists in the four games for his national team, and to the delight of the Bulls, also shot 47.4% from three-point range.\n\nBut with the good came some bad, specifically his defense and decision making, obvious with also averaging five turnovers per game.\n\nGiddey addressed his defensive shortcomings when he met with the Bulls media earlier in the summer and promised that changes would come sooner rather than later. It was those defensive shortcomings that played a part in Giddey losing valuable playing time late in games with the Thunder.\n\n\"It was probably a blessing in disguise for me,\" Giddey said of what he went through in his final games with Oklahoma City. \"It really taught me what I need to work on, how I need to get better. Obviously, the shooting is a big one, but also the defensive end. Coming into this season a switch just flipped in my mind and I just realized that to be at the highest level you've got to really be able to compete at that end. You've got to be able to sit there and guard guys.\n\n\"It's (the defensive) side of the ball that I really want to take steps in so that when playoff time comes around, I'm ready to go on both sides of the ball, not just pick on one.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Giddey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josh Giddey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonzo_Ball", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lonzo Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cartilage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Caruso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Caruso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d690e86/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4011x2290+0+172/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F3d%2F903272724c68875d2cb9a438bda0%2F2165547598.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804246", "eventUri": "eng-9804246", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-01-", "textStart": 512, "textEnd": 519}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

It was clear the Detroit Pistons' division rival missed the presence of their top playmaking guard when he went down with a significant setback.\n\nThe Bulls expected to face an extended period of time without Ball in the mix, but nobody could assume he would miss two seasons worth of games.\n\nAfter striking a sign-and-trade deal to move on from the New Orleans Pelicans, Ball was a missing piece for the Bulls. He found success in his first 35 games with the team, averaging 13 points, five rebounds, and five assists while shooting a career-high 42 percent from the field and from beyond the arc.\n\nA knee injury sidelined Ball for the majority of the 2021-2022 season. He went on to miss the following two years. For a while now, Ball's been battling his way back and remains in the Bulls' plans for the time being. Will he be back in time for the start of the 2024-2025 season? Only time will tell what his timeline looks like.\n\nRecently, Ball addressed the state of his recovery. On the 'What An Experience' podcast, Ball noted that he would start scrimmaging five-on-five in August, which is a major step forward. How he performs in his first major test of this offseason will dictate when he could be ready.\n\n\"My first real test, I feel like, will be this August when I play five-on-five for the first time -- full court,\" said Ball. \"I'll have a better update then. So far, it's so good. Everything has been going well. I'm getting stronger as well in the weight room. I have no complaints right now. I'm getting more comfortable each week. I can feel my movements getting back to normal. The more time that I'm on the court, it's just about finding that balance. You know how much stress I can put on it during the day. I'm trying to juggle with it right now, but like I said, I'll have a better understanding of that when I start playing five-on-five.\"\n\nDuring his limited time in Chicago, Ball faced the Pistons three times. He found success from the field in all three of those matchups, averaging 14 points per game while totaling 16 rebounds and ten assists across three outings.\n\nIt's clear the Pistons and the Bulls will be the two teams fighting to avoid the bottom of the division next season. With the Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Indiana Pacers coming off of playoff appearances, the Pistons and the Bulls are more on a rebuilding timeline rather than contending.\n\nBall's presence in Chicago could be a difference-maker if he manages to hit his stride again. However, he's got a long path to return to his old form. Based on what happens this month, a lot can change for Ball and the Bulls.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_grasso@si.com", "name": "Justin Grasso", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonzo_Ball", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lonzo Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Table_Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Table Tennis", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3649,h_2052,x_0,y_165/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_pistons/01j4gbz56wfht9avq5wm.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804246", "eventUri": "eng-9804246", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

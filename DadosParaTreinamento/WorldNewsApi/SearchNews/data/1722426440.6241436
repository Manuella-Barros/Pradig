{"id": 243355206, "title": "Peter Andre, 51, reveals half-naked gym snap after refusing to take top off for sad reason", "text": "Peter Andre put on a body confident display as he posted topless in the gym. It comes after the father-of-five said he was struggling with his image. In a photo shared to Instagram, the 51-year-old poses in front of a mirror to flaunt his toned muscles writing: \"In the gym first thing this morning.\" But while Peter's followers might think revealing his body would come easily to the singer known for his muscle-bound look, he has actually had to work just as hard on his body image as he has on his physique after battling with his feelings on how he looks now compared to his early days of pop stardom. Peter, who recently welcomed baby Arabella with his wife Emily MacDonagh, found fame in the 90s with his single Mysterious Girl, where the video showed him topless and flexing his rippling muscles under a waterfall. Of course, the star's body has changed since his early twenties, but despite still being in great shape he has suffered from body dysmorphia after cruel headlines pointed out his insecurities. He previously told OK!: \"I was alone on a beach in the Bahamas, so I took my shirt off and went in the water. The sea was really rough and when I came out I remember I was gasping. There was some paparazzi photographer in the trees and he must have caught me breathing out.\" \"The photo got sent all around the world and it was the first time people had seen me like that since the early days. I remember the headlines 'Andre piles on the pack'. People who were heavier than me might have thought, 'But he looks alright', but in my mind I looked like Brendan Fraser in The Whale. We never see what other people see.\" \"Now, I've got this psychological link to something and it's stopping me just freely walking around the beach I just won't do it. It's ridiculous.\" Looking back on his childhood and teenage years growing up in Australia, Peter told how he had \"this little obsession\" with working out. He added: \"By my twenties I was very into clean eating. I was eating raw eggs in a milkshake with protein powders for breakfast. No oil, no butter, no fat. I was looking amazing but feeling terrible. As work schedules were getting crazy, I was getting sick every couple of weeks and cancelling shows. I had no body fat. My dad said to me, 'You have to start eating' and I'd say, 'No, I've created this image. Now I've got to stay this way.'\" \"I remember biting into a McDonald's burger on a Saturday night and it felt like I was hallucinating. I'd think to myself, 'You're a bad boy. You need to go and exercise so hard' and that's not healthy.\" Peter has said that he feels more comfortable in himself at home, but that a beach body is his \"last insecurity\". He said: \"When I am at home I don't feel insecure about my body or even my hair. It's the only place I feel comfortable enough not to have to use the straighteners.\" Talking about getting older, he said: \"My abs are at a hibernation stage. As for treatments, the only thing I've ever really had was a little baby Botox because HDTV shows the lines. I've had no fillers or anything like that and I don't dye my hair I'm not interested. I want to see how it plays out a little bit.\" \"People will always compare me to how I looked back then. Even though I look and feel good, I don't look exactly the same. The bit I have to work on is that, in fact, nobody really cares.\"", "summary": "Peter Andre put on a body confident display as he posted topless in the gym.", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/peter-andre-51-reveals-half-33133219", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article33133218.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_peter-andre-in-a-swimming-pool-1996.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:24:26", "author": "Katie Archer", "authors": ["Katie Archer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.074}

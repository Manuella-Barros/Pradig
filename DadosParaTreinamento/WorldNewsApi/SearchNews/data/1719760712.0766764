{"id": 225016036, "title": "Bryan Kohberger Defense Faces DNA Battle", "text": "Bryan Kohberger, the man charged with the 2022 murder of four University of Idaho students, is fighting to ensure jurors are not presented with DNA evidence that prosecutors say links him to the crime, according to an attorney.Kohberger, 29, is charged with four counts of murder and one count of burglary regarding the deaths of Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Madison Mogen, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20. They were found stabbed to death in a rental home near the university campus in Moscow on November 13, 2022.The judge entered not guilty pleas on Kohberger's behalf last year. He faces the death penalty if convicted. A trial date has not been set.Police arrested Kohberger, then a graduate student at Washington State University in nearby Pullman, at his parents' home in Pennsylvania about six weeks after the killings after investigators pieced together DNA evidence, cellphone data and surveillance video that they say tied him to the murders.A probable cause affidavit unsealed in January 2023 said that DNA on a knife sheath found at the crime scene had been matched to Kohberger's father's DNA, which was recovered from trash outside the Kohberger family home. Months after Kohberger's arrest, prosecutors acknowledged that a DNA technique known as investigative genetic genealogy, or IGG, had initially led investigators to Kohberger.Earlier this year, Judge John Judge of Idaho's 2nd Judicial District ordered prosecutors to turn over some of the IGG records to Kohberger's attorneys.Prosecutors have argued that they shouldn't have to turn over the IGG evidence because it was not used to obtain any warrants and will not be presented at trial.But Kohberger's public defender Anne Taylor has said that the defense needs to see all the DNA evidence in the case to understand how and when police began to focus on Kohberger as a suspect, and to better prepare their defense.A closed-door court hearing has been scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on Thursday to hear arguments on a motion to allow defense investigators to review the IGG materials, and unseal parts of the materials.Court documents show that two DNA experts, Leah Larkin and Bicka Barlow, will be testifying as defense witnesses during that hearing.One of those has criticized IGG, saying law enforcement and genealogists have in some cases engaged in deceptive practices.Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of the West Coast Trial Lawyers law firm, told Newsweek that it would be \"a huge win\" for Kohberger's defense if the DNA evidence was not shown to jurors.\"The single source DNA found at the scene is the key piece of evidence tying Kohberger to the murders, so if the defense can get it suppressed so the jury does not hear about it, that is a huge win,\" Rahmani said.Some opponents argue that IGG violates Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure without probable cause.But prosecutors will argue that the DNA \"was obtained from discarded food, and there is no Fourth Amendment expectation of privacy in trash that is thrown out,\" Rahmani said.\"These types of pre-trial motions and hearings are common when there is a constitutional argument, but the defense is going to have to argue that the IGG was an unlawful search if they are to have any chance of success.\"", "summary": "A closed-door court hearing has been scheduled to hear arguments on a motion to allow defense investigators to review investigative genetic genealogy materials.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/bryan-kohberger-defense-dna-battle-1905745", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2400514/bryan-koberger-listens-during-hearing.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:42:25", "author": "Khaleda Rahman", "authors": ["Khaleda Rahman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.288}

{"id": 232073574, "title": "The audacious operation did little to resolve the many challenges facing Israel\u2019s government.", "text": "For months, Israelis had heard only about hostages being killed or declared dead in Gaza. The \u201clucky\u201d families were those whose loved ones\u2019 remains were retrieved by soldiers, at great risk, and brought home to Israel for burial. So the audacious rescue on Saturday of four living hostages instantly raised morale in Israel and offered a momentary victory, at least, for the country\u2019s embattled prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. But by Sunday, euphoria was already giving way to a harsh reality. The heavy air and ground assault that accompanied the rescue killed scores of Palestinians, including civilians, according to Gaza health officials. And the operation failed to resolve any of the deep dilemmas and challenges vexing the Israeli government. Eight months into its grinding war in Gaza, Israel still appears to be far from achieving its stated objectives of dismantling Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities. And Israelis fear that time is running out for many of the hostages in Gaza. About a third of the 120 that remain have already been declared dead by the Israeli authorities.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/middleeast/the-audacious-operation-did-little-to-resolve-the-many-challenges-facing-israels-government.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:32:34", "author": "Isabel Kershner", "authors": ["Isabel Kershner"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.107}

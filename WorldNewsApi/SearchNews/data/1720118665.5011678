{"id": 227557218, "title": "City sours on proposed location for new Oceanside police headquarters", "text": "Higher than expected costs for the Oceanside Police Department's proposed new headquarters on Rancho Del Oro Road have city staffers looking for another location. A more likely site now appears to be land available at the City Operations Center, where the Public Works Department and municipal yard are located, at the eastern end of Oceanside Boulevard near the city's border with Vista, said Oceanside Assistant City Manager Michael Gossman. The Oceanside City Council asked staffers in 2022 for studies and preliminary construction designs for a building on 5.8 acres the city owns in the 1200 block of Rancho Del Oro Road, across the street from the city\u2019s 465-acre El Corazon Park. The property is leased to a truck-driving school. \"While the location of the RDO site seemed appealing at first and passed our initial threshold assessments, once we got into design we realized that the cost to construct on that site was going to be well outside anything the city could realistically manage,\" Gossman said Thursday. \"We started value engineering to get the price down, but right away had to do away with many of the things that made the site appealing in the first place (an on-site shooting range and training facilities),\" he said in an email. \"While I would not say that RDO is completely off the table, it is no longer the favored location and we are no longer doing design work on that location,\" Gossman said. Until recently, the city leased part of the Oceanside Boulevard property to Hobie Cat, which made kayaks and other equipment there. However, the company has moved most of its manufacturing to Mexico. \"We are working with an architect on a plan that would allow us to construct a police headquarters and training center on that parcel at a cost roughly 40 percent less than what the RDO site was coming out at,\" he said. An updated plan will be presented to the City Council by the end of the summer, Gossman said. Police Chief Kedrick Sadler informed members of the city's Police and Fire Commission of the change at their May 16 meeting. Once the council approves the plan and financing is worked out, it could take at least three years to design the building, find funding and build it. \"If this change in location slows down the process, it wouldn\u2019t be by more than a few months, but I\u2019d much rather go slow and get it right then move fast and put the city in an untenable financial position,\" Gossman said. Since 1999, the Police Department has occupied two buildings, formerly a Megafoods grocery store and a Miller\u2019s Outpost clothing shop, totaling about 50,000 square feet in a strip mall on Mission Avenue, just east of El Camino Real. The city purchased the strip mall property in 1997 after the Police Department outgrew its former 25,000-square-foot building at 1617 Mission Ave., a few blocks east of Interstate 5. The Mission Avenue location was intended to be temporary until a better home could be built. A 2009 study estimated the department would need eight to 10 acres for a single-story building with parking and estimated the facilities would cost between $70 million and $100 million. However, the project was shelved at the time because the city had no money for construction. The relatively small size of the Rancho Del Oro property would require a multi-level building with a parking structure, which increased construction costs to well over $100 million. Money to kick-start planning for the new headquarters came from Measure X, a half-cent sales tax approved by 55 percent of Oceanside voters in November 2018.", "summary": "Cost estimates prove excessive for city-owned site approved for further study in 2022 near El Corazon Park", "url": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/north-county/oceanside/story/2024-06-02/location-chosen-for-new-opd-headquarters-turns-sour", "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b31f230/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2016x1058+0+79/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9b%2Ffd%2Fa548a9dc4aa98a3eeb419610eabf%2Fopd-hq.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:00:59", "author": "Phil Diehl", "authors": ["Phil Diehl"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.177}

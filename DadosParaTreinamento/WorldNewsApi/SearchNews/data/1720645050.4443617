A video of a couple using mini umbrellas so they can scroll their phones while sunbathing has attracted criticism from others online, with some even labelling the accessory \u2018sad\u2019. Posted on Instagram by the @britlife_ account, the clip shows the pair protecting their devices from the rays with suction cup shade attachments (available from the likes of Amazon and The Range) as they chill out on sun loungers And although the post\u2019s caption described the tiny parasols as a \u2018game changer\u2019, comments poured in from those who felt differently. \u2018If you are on holiday try looking at each other for a change,\u2019 said @malonkelly, while @lisanott7 wrote: \u2018That\u2019s just sad. Enjoy where you are and who you\u2019re with!\u2019 Another who disapproved, @alison_h07, urged the couple to \u2018read a book\u2019, followed by @djadamdaniel, who added: \u2018Imagine paying to go on a holiday and spending it all on your phone.\u2019 https://www.instagram.com/p/C77SNNXsjaW There were some who defended them, though, including @frankly.em who replied: \u2018All those judging\u2026 how is it different to reading a book or a magazine on holiday? They could be on a Kindle app for all you know, or listening to music.\u2019 But whatever they\u2019re doing on their devices, they\u2019re not alone. A survey of 9,000 people by Hotels.com revealed 55% of Brits would rather travel alongside their phone than a loved one, a friend, or family member, and one in ten holidaymakers used their phones for more than seven hours each day during a break. This was largely to scroll social media, but keeping up with the news, researching their destination, and messaging friends and family at home also made up respondents\u2019 screen time. The fact is, most of us swap between thumbing through a paperback and browsing the internet while we catch a few rays, and this handy tool solves the problem of glare and overheating batteries. These nifty tools keep your phone screen glare-free (Picture: The Range) Winding down with your favourite tech on a couple\u2019s holiday only becomes a problem when it impacts your relationship, either because you forgo quality time together as a result or because you\u2019re so glued to your phone that you miss \u2018bids\u2019 from your partner. According to Match dating expert, Hayley Quinn: \u2018Relationship bids can be physical, such as asking for a hug, or verbal, such as sharing information about your day, or wanting to do a chore or an activity together. They could also be as subtle as smiling at your partner.\u2019 Responding positively to these bids for connection strengthens a relationship, but ignoring them repeatedly leaves can leave your partner feeling ignored and chip away at their self-esteem \u2013 not what you want on a romantic getaway. It seems shared experiences are something couples are increasingly interested in too. Research from Hitched found a 36% of newlyweds last year spent their honeymoon sightseeing, while more than a quarter (27%) celebrated their nuptials with an adventure such as a safari or hiking trip. One bride, Gabriella Smith, told the wedding publication: \u2018To us, visiting somewhere and just lying on a beach feels like a bit of a waste.\u2019 It\u2019s really a case of different stroke for different folks \u2013 after all, you\u2019re the one that\u2019s paying for it.

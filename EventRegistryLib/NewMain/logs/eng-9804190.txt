While no injuries were reported, emergency personnel arrived at the scene to get the passengers off the plane and transport them back to the terminal.\n\nWCNC Charlotte relayed a statement from Delta Airlines:\n\nThe right main gear of Delta 8860 exited the taxiway at Charlotte Douglas International Airport following a normal arrival. No injuries were reported by the 188 customers who are deplaning and being bused to the terminal. We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.\n\nThe Panthers lost a rain-soaked game to the Patriots, 17-3. Their flight departed from Providence, Rhode Island afterward. Delta Flight 8860 landed on taxiway 36R closest to the Billy Graham Parkway around 2:35 a.m., according to WCNC.\n\nIt's unclear what caused the plane to stray from its path. Perhaps coincidentally, a different flight to Charlotte (from Tampa Bay) experienced such severe turbulence in the air that four flight attendants were injured and reportedly had to be taken to a hospital upon landing Thursday.\n\nPlayers, coaches and staff reportedly bussed to the terminal after the plane was evacuated.\n\nCarolina's long night followed a tough slog on the gridiron in its preseason opener.\n\nA fourth-quarter field goal accounted for the Panthers' only points in a game that saw neither starting quarterback Bryce Young nor backup Andy Dalton take a single snap.\n\nHead coach Dave Canales previously indicated Young would play sparingly in the preseason, while Dalton is nursing a quad injury and was unavailable for the opener. Jack Plummer (11 of 21 passing) and Jake Luton (7 of 9) took all of the snaps. The lopsided result on the field was at least somewhat foreseeable.\n\nThe team will have ample time to get things right in practice. The Panthers' next game is scheduled for Aug. 17 against the New York Jets. They won't have to board a plane for that game -- it'll be played at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte.\n\nFortunately, no major injuries emerged from the Panthers' side during the game.

So, he really showed something and showed us something about him.\"\n\nSecond-year linebacker Eku Leota also made his presence felt, tallying two tackles, both for a loss. He added a quarterback hurry and a couple stops on special teams.\n\n\"Eku it just starts with strength,\" Canales said. \"He played so hard tonight and was playing physical.

The aircraft, identified as a Boeing 767-300, veered off the taxiway upon landing, prompting a swift response from emergency crews stationed at the airport. This incident, which occurred around 2:40 a.m., had significant implications for the passengers on board as well as the overall operations at the airport.\n\nAfter the aircraft touched down on the runway closest to the Billy Graham Parkway, near the Sullenberger Aviation Museum, the right-side landing gear reportedly exited the taxiway. Despite this deviation from the expected landing trajectory, Delta Airlines confirmed that there were no injuries among the 188 passengers on board. Emergency vehicles promptly surrounded the aircraft, ensuring that all necessary precautions were in place.\n\nApproximately an hour after the incident, around 3:45 a.m., airport personnel arranged for stairs to be towed to the taxiway, allowing passengers to disembark safely. Once all passengers had exited the plane, they were transported by bus to the terminal, where they were provided with the necessary assistance and information regarding their onward journeys.\n\nAs the situation unfolded, the operational schedule at Charlotte Douglas International Airport began to reflect the disruption caused by the incident. According to data from FlightAware, by 4 a.m., the airport had experienced a ripple effect with 19 flights being delayed and six others canceled. While it remains unclear whether the Delta flight's taxiway mishap directly contributed to these delays and cancellations, the timing coincided with Tropical Depression Debby's departure from the Carolinas, adding to the challenges faced by the airport's operations team.\n\nThis incident at CLT highlights several key considerations for the travel industry, particularly in terms of safety protocols and operational readiness during unexpected events. While the safe disembarkation of passengers without injury is commendable, the incident serves as a reminder of the potential disruptions that can occur even with routine landings. The presence of Tropical Depression Debby further complicates the situation, illustrating how weather conditions can exacerbate the challenges faced by airlines and airports.\n\nFor travelers, the immediate impact was evident in the delays and cancellations at one of the nation's busiest airports. These operational hiccups can lead to a cascading effect, disrupting travel plans not only for those on the affected Delta flight but also for passengers on connecting flights and other scheduled services. As the travel industry continues to recover from recent global challenges, incidents like these underscore the importance of robust contingency planning and real-time communication with passengers.", "source": {"uri": "travelandtourworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Travel And Tour World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxiway", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taxiway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Douglas_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Douglas International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Route_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Route 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_gear", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landing gear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_767", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 767"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlightAware", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FlightAware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolinas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carolinas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation_Authorities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation Authorities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Delta-Airlines.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804190", "eventUri": "eng-9804190", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

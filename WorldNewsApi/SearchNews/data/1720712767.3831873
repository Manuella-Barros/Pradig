The night before this year\u2019s Gov Ball performance, the Killers played a warm-up show at New York\u2019s Bowery Ballroom, a considerably smaller venue that the arenas and festival main stages the band frequents on their tours the past few decades. Perhaps to prepare for the coming Vegas residency, the Killers dusted off Hot Fuss\u2019 \u201cAndy, You\u2019re a Star\u201d for the first time live for the first time in 2018.

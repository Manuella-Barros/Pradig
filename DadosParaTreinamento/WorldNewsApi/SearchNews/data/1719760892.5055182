Gardens, balconies, verges, fields, woods and patches of wilderness across Germany will be the scene of this year\u2019s \u201cinsect summer,\u201d now in its seventh year, organized by the country\u2019s Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union, or NABU. The environmental group has invited people to spend an hour counting the insects they see in a 10-meter (33-foot) radius. \u201cWe have seen that a few insects that normally occur only in the south might be spreading further north,\u201d including the violet carpenter bee, says Laura Breitkreuz, an expert on biodiversity and entomology at NABU, describing that as a sign of advancing climate change and warmer temperatures.

Set from May 31 to June 9 and Aug. 2 to Aug. 11, the environmental group has invited people to spend an hour counting the insects they see in a 10-meter radius (33-foot) radius and report what they see to NABU.

Insects are an essential building block of ecosystems, crucial to pollination, food chains and to keeping the soil productive. But from bees to butterflies, insect populations have been in decline in recent decades \u2014 a drop often blamed on human causes such as the use of damaging chemicals, destruction of natural habitats and climate change.

Organizers have prepared a form and a mobile app to help people identify and report their firebug and lacewing sightings during this year\u2019s two insect-counting events. Those are set from May 31 to June 9 and Aug. 2-11, giving insect-counters a chance to see what\u2019s flying and crawling in different seasons. No equipment is needed to join in.

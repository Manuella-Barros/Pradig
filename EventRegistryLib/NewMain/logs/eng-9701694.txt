The deal, which includes surrendering certain routes and slots, aims to enhance Lufthansa's presence in Southern Europe. It will also facilitate ITA's access to Africa and Latin America. Shares in both Lufthansa and its rival IAG surged following the announcement, reflecting market optimism about further airline mergers and acquisitions in Europe.\n\nLufthansa won EU antitrust approval to buy 41% of ITA Airways for 325 million euros ($350 million) on Wednesday after ceding routes and slots, with the news boosting rival IAG's shares and hopes for its takeover of Air Europa. The deal will boost Lufthansa's presence in the lucrative southern European market and is one of three high-profile sector transactions in Europe, underscoring efforts by its airlines to boost scale to offset rising operating costs.\n\nLufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr told a press conference in Rome that ITA's Fiumicino airport hub gave the group better access to Africa and Latin America and that it had much room for growth. Shares in Lufthansa were up 3.27% at 1339 GMT after the announcement, with IAG shares up by 4.6% on anticipation that the approval made its takeover of Air Europa more likely to be given the green light.\n\nIAG said it was glad that the Commission recognised the benefits of airline consolidation. \"Regulatory scrutiny remains high, but the deal has likely increased confidence that airline M&A can gain approval, subject to remedies negotiated with competition authorities,\" said Ruairi Cullinane, an analyst at RBC.\n\nITA also offers key long-haul routes to Lufthansa, which has an option to take full ownership if the Italian airline's financial performance improves. Lufthansa and ITA agreed to cede Italian short-haul routes to one or two rivals, the European Commission said, confirming a Reuters report. The German airline has said it is in talks with Easyjet and Spanish low-cost carrier Volotea.\n\nThe combined group will also undertake interlining agreements or slot swaps for long-haul routes to increase frequencies and improve connections for one-stop flights. Interlining deals allow individual airlines to handle passengers travelling on itineraries requiring multiple flights on multiple carriers.\n\nLufthansa and ITA will also transfer some of the state-owned airline's slots for short-haul routes at Milan's Linate airport to competitors, allowing them to set up a sustainable base. A Lufthansa spokesperson said the airlines would give away 204 slots per week at Linate Airport in Milan in the summer, and 192 in the winter. That means that under the new deal, ITA and Lufthansa will have fewer slots than before.\n\nIt would also provide better connections for its competitors at key hubs in North America, namely Washington, San Francisco and Toronto, the spokesperson said. \"The package of remedies proposed by Lufthansa and the MEF (Italy's ministry of economy) on this cross-border deal fully addresses our competition concerns by ensuring that a sufficient level of competitive pressure remains on all relevant routes,\" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.\n\nNEXT STEPS It was not an easy negotiation, with Italy's Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti saying in Rome that he argued with Spohr over details \"until the last minute\". ITA would no longer need state aid as part of the deal, he added.\n\n\"This is the best option right now for ITA and for Italy, a privatisation that goes through Lufthansa which has a multi-hub strategy and wants to focus on Fiumicino ... this is also good for the Italian taxpayer,\" said Andrea Giuricin, a transport analyst at TRA consulting. The deal can only close once rivals, approved by the EU antitrust watchdog, start operating the routes. EU regulators had been frustrated with its previous approved deals during which rivals declined to take up routes and slots because they said they could not compete with Lufthansa.\n\nLufthansa has faced rising labour costs tied to strikes earlier this year, causing it to issue a profit warning. Analysts say it will not be easy to rebuild ITA, whose predecessor Alitalia faced decades of financial struggles and bailouts, and Lufthansa will likely need to make a significant investment.\n\nRegulators in Europe also worry the region's three largest airline groups - IAG, Air France KLM and Lufthansa - are becoming too dominant, potentially hurting consumer choice and making flying less affordable. The Commission is examining British Airways-owner IAG's bid to buy Air Europa and is also set to evaluate Air France-KLM's offer to take a 19.9% stake in Scandinavia's SAS. ($1 = 0.9295 euros)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

But the deal allows for a full takeover by Lufthansa from next year.\n\nThe acquisition, agreed with the Italian government in May last year, will see Lufthansa pay \u20ac325 million to complete the takeover.\n\nLufthansa said it plans a \"swift integration\" of ITA into its group, which comprises Lufhansa, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines and Eurowings.\n\nChief executive Carsten Spohr welcomed the approval as \"excellent news for ITA Airways and Lufthansa and for all passengers flying to and from Italy\".\n\nHe said: \"The decision is a clear signal for strong air traffic in Europe, which can successfully assert itself in global competition.\"\n\nThe Italian MEF ministry and ITA Airways also welcomed the decision.\n\nThe EC said this followed an \"in-depth investigation\" of the proposed transaction as \"Lufthansa and ITA operate an extensive network of routes from their respective hubs in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy [and] their operations are to a significant extent complementary\".\n\nHowever, it noted: \"Whilst ITA is performing well today, ITA's long-term sustainability as a stand-alone carrier would have remained highly uncertain absent the transaction.\"\n\nLufthansa said it agreed a package of concessions \"following intensive negotiations with the European Commission\", including the transfer of slots at Milan-Linate Airport \"to a competitor\" on short-haul routes.\n\nThis rival carrier \"will take over single routes on which Lufthansa Group airlines and ITA Airways operate today as competitors\".\n\nThe group also agreed to operate additional feeder flights from Rome to the hubs of European competitors to \"ensure improved competition on long-haul routes from Rome to North America\".\n\nMargrethe Vestager, EC executive vice-president in charge of competition policy, said: \"At a time when consumers are facing increasingly higher prices for air travel, it is very important to preserve competition in the sector.\"\n\nShe argued: \"The package of remedies proposed by Lufthansa and the MEF on this cross-border deal fully addresses our competition concerns by ensuring that a sufficient level of competitive pressure remains on all relevant routes.\"\n\nLufthansa said ITA will retain its brand name while benefiting from the airline group's 'synergies', including its worldwide sales network, aircraft and fuel purchasing, and loyalty programme Miles & More.\n\nIt said the route networks will be linked as soon as the transaction closes and commercial processes, IT systems and purchasing processes \"will be harmonised as quickly as possible\".\n\nITA Airways will also join the Star Alliance of carriers \"in the near future\", having previously been a member of the SkyTeam alliance of Air France-KLM, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic.\n\nThe deal will make Italy Lufthansa Group's fifth 'home market' and the largest by revenue after Germany and the US. Rome-Fiumicino will become the Lufthansa Group's sixth and southernmost hub.\n\nItaly is already the most important market for the group outside its home markets and the US.\n\nSpohr argued: \"The acquisition of ITA Airways strengthens the internationalisation of the Lufthansa Group.\n\n\"Despite comprehensive and far-reaching concessions, the investment in ITA Airways strengthens the Lufthansa Group's position in global competition.\"\n\nHe promised: \"We will make ITA Airways a strong and successful part of our company and secure its future as an international airline and strong brand.\"\n\nThe deal remains subject to approval by competition authorities outside the EU.\n\nITA Airways was founded in November 2020 following the winding up of Alitalia and began operations in October 2021.\n\nThe airline carried almost 15 million passengers last year.

The German airline has said it is in talks with Easyjet and Spanish low-cost carrier Volotea.\n\nThe combined group will also undertake interlining agreements or slot swaps for long-haul routes to increase frequencies and improve connections for one-stop flights, it added. Interlining agreements allow individual airlines to handle passengers traveling on itineraries that require multiple flights on multiple carriers.\n\nLufthansa and ITA will also transfer some of the state-owned airline's slots for short-haul routes at Milan's Linate airport to competitors, allowing them to set up a sustainable base.\n\n\"The package of remedies proposed by Lufthansa and the MEF (Italy's ministry of economy) on this cross-border deal fully addresses our competition concerns by ensuring that a sufficient level of competitive pressure remains on all relevant routes,\" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.\n\nLufthansa can only close the deal once rivals, approved by the EU antitrust watchdog, start operating the routes. EU regulators had been frustrated with its previous approved deals during which rivals declined to take up routes and slots because they said they could not compete with Lufthansa.\n\nLufthansa has faced rising labor costs tied to strikes earlier this year, causing it to issue a profit warning.\n\nAnalysts say it will not be easy to turn around ITA, whose predecessor Alitalia faced decades of financial struggles and bailouts. Lufthansa will likely need to make a significant investment to rebuild ITA.\n\nRegulators in Europe also worry the region's three largest airline groups - IAG, Air France KLM and Lufthansa - are becoming too dominant, potentially hurting consumer choice and making flying less affordable.\n\nThe Commission is currently examining British Airways-owner IAG's bid to buy Air Europa.

But the deal allows for a full takeover by Lufthansa from next year.\n\nThe acquisition, agreed with the Italian government in May last year, will see Lufthansa pay \u20ac325 million to complete the takeover.\n\nLufthansa said it plans a \"swift integration\" of ITA into its airline group, which comprises Lufhansa, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines and Eurowings.\n\nChief executive Carsten Spohr welcomed the approval as \"excellent news for ITA Airways and Lufthansa and for all passengers flying to and from Italy\".\n\nHe said: \"The decision is a clear signal for strong air traffic in Europe, which can successfully assert itself in global competition.\"\n\nThe Italian MEF ministry and ITA Airways also welcomed the decision.\n\nThe EC said it followed an in-depth investigation of the proposed transaction as \"Lufthansa and ITA operate an extensive network of routes from their respective hubs in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy [and] their operations are to a significant extent complementary\".\n\nHowever, it noted: \"Whilst ITA is performing well today, ITA's long-term sustainability as a stand-alone carrier would have remained highly uncertain absent the transaction.\"\n\nLufthansa said it agreed a package of concessions \"following intensive negotiations with the European Commission\", including the transfer of slots at Milan-Linate Airport to a competitor on short-haul routes.\n\nThis rival carrier \"will take over single routes on which Lufthansa Group airlines and ITA Airways operate today as competitors\".\n\nThe group also agreed to operate additional feeder flights from Rome to the hubs of European competitors to \"ensure improved competition on long-haul routes from Rome to North America\".\n\nMargrethe Vestager, EC executive vice-president in charge of competition policy, said: \"At a time when consumers are facing increasingly higher prices for air travel, it is very important to preserve competition in the sector.\"\n\nShe argued: \"The package of remedies proposed by Lufthansa and the MEF on this cross-border deal fully addresses our competition concerns by ensuring that a sufficient level of competitive pressure remains on all relevant routes.\"\n\nLufthansa said ITA will retain its brand name while benefiting from the airline group's 'synergies', including its worldwide sales network, aircraft and fuel purchasing, and loyalty programme Miles & More.\n\nIt said the route networks will be linked as soon as the transaction closes and commercial processes, IT systems and purchasing processes \"will be harmonised as quickly as possible\".\n\nITA Airways will also join the Star Alliance of carriers \"in the near future\", having previously been a member of the SkyTeam alliance of Air France-KLM, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic. in order to exploit the numerous synergy effects.\n\nThe deal will make Italy the Lufthansa Group's fifth 'home market', and the largest by revenue after Germany and the US. Rome-Fiumicino will become the Lufthansa Group's sixth and southernmost hub.\n\nItaly is already the most important market for the group outside its home markets and the US.\n\nSpohr pointed out Italy is the third largest economy in Europe and one of the world's most popular holiday destinations.\n\nHe argued: \"The acquisition of ITA Airways strengthens the internationalisation of the Lufthansa Group.\n\n\"Despite comprehensive and far-reaching concessions, the investment in ITA Airways strengthens the Lufthansa Group's position in global competition.\"\n\nSpohr promised: \"We will make ITA Airways a strong and successful part of our company and secure its future as an international airline and strong brand.\"\n\nThe deal remains subject to approval by competition authorities outside the EU.\n\nITA Airways was founded in November 2020 following the winding up of Alitalia and began operations in October 2021.\n\nThe airline carried almost 15 million passengers last year.

The transaction is conditional on the implementation of remedies agreed with the Commission to address competition concerns.\n\nWhile Lufthansa is initially taking a 41% stake, it also holds options to acquire the remaining shares in the Italian carrier. These can be exercised from 2025 at the earliest.\n\nLufthansa Group chief executive Carsten Spohr says: \"The approval from Brussels is excellent news for ITA Airways and Lufthansa and especially for all passengers flying to and from Italy. The decision is also a clear signal for strong air traffic in Europe, which can successfully assert itself in global competition.\"\n\nIn giving the tie-up the green light, the Commission is requiring Lufthansa and the Italian finance ministry give up assets to rival operators to address competition concerns on short-haul and transatlantic routes.\n\n\"This essentially includes the transfer of slots at Milan Linate airport to a competitor in short-haul traffic,\" Lufthansa says. \"In the 'neighboring traffic' between Italy and the Lufthansa Group's existing home markets, this competitor will take over single routes on which Lufthansa Group airlines and ITA Airways still operate today as competitors.\"\n\nIt adds that additional feeder flights from Rome to hubs of European competitors will also ensure improved competition on long-haul routes from Rome to North America.\n\nSpohr says: \"Despite the comprehensive and far-reaching concessions, the investment in ITA Airways strengthens the Lufthansa Group's position in global competition. We will make ITA Airways a strong and successful part of our company and thus secure its future as an international airline and strong brand.\"\n\nThe approval of the authorities enables the co-operation between ITA Airways and Lufthansa on a commercial and operational level from the date of closing of the transaction. Until then, both companies will continue to act in competition.\n\nRome Fiumicino will become the sixth and southernmost hub within the Lufthansa Group, alongside its existing operations from Frankfurt and Munich in Germany, Zurich in Switzerland, Austrian capital Vienna and Brussels in Belgium.\n\nITA began operations in October 2021, succeeding Alitalia as Italy's national carrier. Last year it flew almost 15 million passengers.

The deal enhances Lufthansa's presence in southern Europe, offering key long-haul routes and bolstering its scale against rising costs. The combined group will cede routes and slots to maintain competitive pressure.\n\nGermany's Lufthansa won EU antitrust approval to buy 41% of Italy's ITA Airways for 325 million euros ($350 million) on Wednesday after ceding routes and slots. The deal will boost Lufthansa's presence in the lucrative southern European market and is one of three high-profile sector transactions in Europe, underscoring efforts by its airlines to boost scale to offset rising operating costs.\n\nITA also offers key long-haul routes to Lufthansa, which has an option to take full ownership if the Italian airline's financial performance improves. Lufthansa and ITA agreed to cede Italian short-haul routes to one or two rivals, the European Commission said, confirming a Reuters report. The German airline has said it is in talks with Easyjet and Spanish low-cost carrier Volotea.\n\nThe combined group will also undertake interlining agreements or slot swaps for long-haul routes to increase frequencies and improve connections for one-stop flights, it added. Interlining agreements allow individual airlines to handle passengers travelling on itineraries that require multiple flights on multiple carriers. Lufthansa and ITA will also transfer some of the state-owned airline's slots for short-haul routes at Milan's Linate airport to competitors, allowing them to set up a sustainable base.\n\n\"The package of remedies proposed by Lufthansa and the MEF (Italy's ministry of economy) on this cross-border deal fully addresses our competition concerns by ensuring that a sufficient level of competitive pressure remains on all relevant routes,\" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. Lufthansa can only close the deal once rivals, approved by the EU antitrust watchdog, start operating the routes. EU regulators had been frustrated with its previous approved deals during which rivals declined to take up routes and slots because they said they could not compete with Lufthansa.\n\nLufthansa has faced rising labour costs tied to strikes earlier this year, causing it to issue a profit warning. Analysts say it will not be easy to turn around ITA, whose predecessor Alitalia faced decades of financial struggles and bailouts. Lufthansa will likely need to make a significant investment to rebuild ITA.\n\nRegulators in Europe also worry the region's three largest airline groups - IAG, Air France KLM and Lufthansa - are becoming too dominant, potentially hurting consumer choice and making flying less affordable. The Commission is currently examining British Airways-owner IAG's bid to buy Air Europa. It is also set to evaluate Air France-KLM's offer to take a 19.9% stake in Scandinavia's SAS.\n\nIAG said it was glad that the Commission recognised the benefits of airline consolidation.

Concerns over monopolies on European routes have been addressed by Lufthansa by giving up slots at Milan Linate Airport. There are also conditions to allow ITA Airways to maintain long-haul flights post-merger, including competitive markets and viable one-stop options.\n\nThe European Commission (EC) has finally approved Germany's Lufthansa's purchase of 41% of the Italian national airline ITA Airways. The latest announcement follows months of consideration by the EC's competition authority since Lufthansa notified Brussels of its intention to acquire the airline in November 2023.\n\nLufthnsa Group will acquire the remaining 59% for a capital contribution of 325 million euros, as agreed in May 2023. The airline group states, \"The investment will be completed through a capital increase. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024.\"\n\nThe airline group has remained steadfast in its commitment to the deal despite significant pushback from the EC over various issues.\n\nPhoto: Angel DiBilio | Shutterstock\n\nPoints of contention included the Lufthansa Group airlines' so-called A++ Atlantic Joint Venture with Air Canada and United. Post-merger, Brussels was also worried about potential monopolies on certain routes within Europe and the transcontinental front.\n\nEU approval\n\nThe long-awaited EU approval comes following a lengthy investigation process initiated by the Commission. Brussels was analyzing whether the Lufthansa-ITA merger would adversely affect competition within Europe. In January, it announced its decision to launch a Phase II investigation, extending its deadline for making a decision. The Commission's first deadline for the end of the in-depth investigation was June 6, 2024. This was later extended to July 4.\n\nRelated Alitalia Was Worthless When It Was Sold; Transaction Now Valued At -\u20ac5 Million\n\nAccording to a 2021 report, Alitalia was shown to be worth less than nothing.\n\nIn a statement, Carsten Spohr, Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, says:\n\n\"The approval from Brussels is excellent news for ITA Airways and Lufthansa and especially for all passengers flying to and from Italy. We look forward to welcoming ITA Airways and its outstanding employees as a new member of our airline family very soon. The decision is also a clear signal for strong air traffic in Europe, which can successfully assert itself in global competition.\"\n\nLong-haul routes to North America\n\nOne of the concerns initially raised by Brussels at the launch of its in-depth investigation was that of long-haul services between Italy and North America. The European Commission believed that the airlines would have a significant advantage in providing air services between the two regions. The Commission said this would be brought about thanks to \"close competition between ITA, Lufthansa or Lufthansa's joint venture partners - through non-stop or convenient one-stop connections and convenient airport locations.\"\n\nAs it stands, ITA Airways offers direct flights to the following destinations in the United States and Canada.\n\nPhoto: GCMap.com\n\nThis does not include connecting options via the Lufthansa Group's European hubs, some of the primary ones being Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna, Brussels, and Zurich. Combined, the Lufthansa offer (once merged with ITA) is immense. It is also important to consider the group's joint venture partners, which include United and Air Canada.\n\nShort-haul routes and a monopoly at Milan Linate\n\nAnother issue that prolonged the approval process was that of monopolies on European routes.\n\nRelated Europe Highlights 39 Routes Of Concern In Lufthansa - ITA Airways Merger\n\n50% of ITA's long-haul network poses an issue for the European Commission in light of Lufthansa's acquisition.\n\nBrussels felt that ITA and Lufthansa were typically the only airlines operating on flights between Italy and Central Europe, with Ryanair also competing but inevitably flying from more remote airports.\n\nPhoto: ITA Airways\n\nLufthansa and ITA's dominant position at the crowded Milan Linate airport was a related concern. The facility, which has very limited available slots and is the most centrally located airport in Milan, is currently an ITA base. Lufthansa Group airlines also offer services to their respective hubs.\n\nTake a look at all the ITA developments here.\n\nWhat do you make of the European Commission's decision?

While her right-wing government will not immediately cash in millions as part of the deal, it will limit exposure to an industrial liability which has weighed on public coffers to keep flying.\n\nFor Meloni, the deal also marks a symbolic element of pride as several governments before hers, including the one led by Mario Draghi, failed to put a definitive end to the Alitalia saga.\n\nThe transaction had been closely watched in the aviation industry as an indicator of how the much overdue consolidation in the European market might progress. Lufthansa and the Italian government had grown increasingly frustrated with the pushback from Brussels in recent months, with Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr saying that he could well live without the Italian business, while the same couldn't be said of ITA without Lufthansa.\n\nUnder the terms of the EU decision, Lufthansa and the Italian government have to make available to at least one rival airline the assets for them to operate non-stop flights between Rome or Milan and certain airports in Central Europe. Lufthansa will also transfer take-off and landing slots at Milan Linate airport for certain European routes.\n\nFor long-haul flights, the new company had pledged to enter into agreements with rivals to improve their competitiveness, by way of interlining agreements or slot swaps.\n\nThe EU commitments require Lufthansa to obtain approval from the European Commission for remedy takers before the deal can finally close, the bloc's regulators said. This means that EU regulators will have to double check if the airlines selected to benefit from the concessions will preserve competition.\n\n--With assistance from Chiara Albanese and Alberto Brambilla.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

It was eventually shut down in October 2021 before a rebirth as ITA.\n\nThe EU wanted to make sure the Lufthansa deal did not lead to higher prices for consumers.\n\nBrussels had been concerned that on a number of short-haul routes between Italy and central Europe as well as long-haul routes between the United States and Canada there would be limited competition, leading to a reduction in quality for passengers.\n\n\"At a time when consumers are facing increasingly higher prices for air travel, it is very important to preserve competition in the sector,\" said the EU's competition chief, Margrethe Vestager.\n\n\"The package of remedies proposed by Lufthansa and the (ministry) on this cross-border deal fully addresses our competition concerns by ensuring that a sufficient level of competitive pressure remains on all relevant routes,\" she added.\n\nraz/ec/cw\n\nMore from this section\n\nBest Way to Hatch Eggs without Moving or Walking at Pokemon GO Fest 2024\n\niMyFone MagicMic

In return, ITA is to receive \u20ac325 million ($350 million) in equity from Lufthansa.\n\nLufthansa could later acquire a further 49%, then the remaining 10%.\n\nThe commission first blocked Lufthansa's move to take a minority stake in ITA in January and opened an investigation into the matter.\n\nReduced competition on short-haul airline routes between Italy and central European countries were highlighted in the commission's investigation, with Lufthansa and ITA competing on direct and indirect flights.\n\nThe alternative for connections between Italy and the central European region was only limited competition from Ryanair, the commission said.\n\nReduced competition on long-haul routes between Italy, Canada and the US was also noted by the commission as a result of Lufthansa's takeover of ITA.\n\nITA's dominant position at Milan airport would also be reinforced by Lufthansa's acquisition of the airline's landing-slot portfolio, the commission said.\n\nLufthansa already operates several hubs in Europe with the four airlines that currently comprise its network: Lufthansa, Austrian, SWISS and Brussels Airlines.\n\nThe risk of a veto from Brussels sparked tensions between EU regulators and the Italian government.\n\nIn June, Italian Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said a rejection from Brussels would be a \"serious attack on Italy,\" which Rome would \"not stand idly by\" and watch.\n\nSalvini, leader of the far-right League party, said such a step could lead to the loss of thousands of jobs.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

While her right-wing government will not immediately cash in millions as part of the deal, it will limit exposure to an industrial liability which has weighed on public coffers to keep flying.\n\nFor Meloni, the deal also marks a symbolic element of pride as several governments before hers, including the one led by Mario Draghi, failed to put a definitive end to the Alitalia saga.\n\nThe transaction had been closely watched in the aviation industry as an indicator of how the much overdue consolidation in the European market might progress. Lufthansa and the Italian government had grown increasingly frustrated with the pushback from Brussels in recent months, with Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr saying that he could well live without the Italian business, while the same couldn't be said of ITA without Lufthansa.\n\nUnder the terms of the EU decision, Lufthansa and the Italian government have to make available to at least one rival airline the assets for them to operate non-stop flights between Rome or Milan and certain airports in Central Europe. Lufthansa will also transfer take-off and landing slots at Milan Linate airport for certain European routes.\n\nFor long-haul flights, the new company had pledged to enter into agreements with rivals to improve their competitiveness, by way of interlining agreements or slot swaps.\n\nThe EU commitments require Lufthansa to obtain approval from the European Commission for remedy takers before the deal can finally close, the bloc's regulators said. This means that EU regulators will have to double check if the airlines selected to benefit from the concessions will preserve competition.\n\nWith ITA, Lufthansa gains an asset that has been persistently unprofitable for decades, but also one that serves one of Europe's largest and most competitive markets. Budget specialists Ryanair Holdings Plc and Easyjet Plc have created large businesses in Italy, a major Mediterranean tourism hub.\n\nLufthansa has proven that it can integrate and turn around ailing national subsidiaries. The German airline group also owns Swiss, Austrian as well as the Belgian Brussels Air businesses. The units have benefited from Lufthansa's global reach and joint purchase agreements on aircraft, as well as funneling more business through the main hubs of Frankfurt or Munich.\n\nIncreasing consolidation in the European airline industry has brought more transactions to the desks of the EU's competition regulators. The bloc's watchdog are also currently probing British Airways parent IAG SA's \u20ac400 million takeover of Air Europa -- a deal that has already been withdrawn once in the past due to regulatory pressure, and could face similar hurdles this time around.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We look forward to welcoming ITA Airways and its outstanding employees as a new member of our airline family very soon. The decision is also a clear signal for strong air traffic in Europe, which can successfully assert itself in global competition.\"\n\nLufthansa Group, the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and ITA Airways have expressly welcomed the EU Commission's approval under competition law. With this clearance of the competition authority, the way is now clear for the acquisition of a minority stake of 41 percent in ITA Airways (Italia Trasporto Aereo S.p.A.) and the subsequent acquisition of the remaining shares by Deutsche Lufthansa AG for a capital contribution of 325 million euros, which was already agreed in May 2023. The investment will be completed through a capital increase. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. This requires both the prior implementation of the remedies negotiated with the EU Commission and the approval of other competition authorities outside the EU. Options for the acquisition of the remaining shares in ITA Airways have been agreed between Lufthansa Group and MEF and can be exercised from 2025 at the earliest.\n\nFollowing the closing, ITA Airways is to become the fifth network airline to be closely integrated with Lufthansa Group while keeping its brand name ITA Airways. As part of the multi-hub, multi-airline and multi-brand system successfully established by the Lufthansa Group, the Italian airline will utilize numerous synergies, for example in world-wide sales, the loyalty program Miles & More or also in aircraft and fuel purchasing.\n\nThis will strengthen and further develop the economic situation of ITA Airways. Italy will become the Lufthansa Group's fifth \"home market\". It will then be the Lufthansa Group's second largest market in terms of revenue after Germany and the USA. Italy is already the second most important market for the company outside its home markets after the USA. In terms of gross domestic product, Italy is the third largest economy in Europe with a strongly export-oriented economy and one of the most popular vacation destinations worldwide.\n\nLufthansa Group and ITA Airways are jointly planning a swift integration ITA Airways with its almost 5,000 employees will make the corporate culture of the Lufthansa Group even more international and diverse. Rome-Fiumicino will become the Lufthansa Group's sixth and geographically southernmost hub. Last year, the airport was awarded with five Skytrax stars.\n\nImmediately after the closing, the route networks are to be linked with each other through code sharing so that customers can combine the airlines' offers. This will create over 1,000 new transfer options, creating many more options to destinations in South America, North Africa and the Middle East in particular. ITA Airways will also strengthen competition in Italy, which is currently characterized by a superior position of low-cost airlines.\n\nITA Airways already focuses on quality and a premium approach with an Italian service culture. Members of its existing loyalty program \"Volare\" will also be able to collect or use their miles with Miles & More from the first day after the closing. In addition, the respective lounges will be mutually accessible. ITA Airways is aiming to join the Star Alliance in the near future. Commercial processes, IT systems and purchasing processes will be harmonized as quickly as possible in order to exploit the numerous synergy effects.\n\nCarsten Spohr says: \"The acquisition of ITA Airways strengthens the internationalization of the Lufthansa Group. We offer our guests a significantly greater choice of connections and destinations, and with the 5-star hub in Rome we are also extending our premium offering and better connecting strategic future markets south of the equator to our network. Despite the comprehensive and far-reaching concessions, the investment in ITA Airways strengthens the Lufthansa Group's position in global competition. We will make ITA Airways a strong and successful part of our company and thus secure its future as an international airline and strong brand. ITA Airways will support us in further expanding our position as Number One in Europe.\"\n\nThe approval of the authorities enables the cooperation between ITA Airways and Lufthansa Group on a commercial and operational level from the date of closing of the transaction. Until then, both companies will continue to act in competition.\n\nThe integration of ITA Airways into the airline network of the Lufthansa Group is to start with the closing. The approval of the authorities enables the cooperation between ITA Airways and Lufthansa Group on a commercial and operational level from the date of closing of the transaction. Until then, both companies will continue to act in competition. Following intensive negotiations with the European Commission, the parties have agreed on a package of concessions. This essentially includes the transfer of slots at Milan-Linate Airport to a competitor in short-haul traffic. In the \"neighboring traffic\" between Italy and the Lufthansa Group's existing home markets, this competitor will take over single routes on which Lufthansa Group Airlines and ITA Airways still operate today as competitors. Additional feeder flights from Rome to hubs of European competitors will also ensure improved competition on long-haul routes from Rome to North America.\n\nITA Airways was founded in November 2020, started its operations on 15 October 2021 and currently has around 4,860 employees. Based in Rome, the airline carried almost 15 million passengers last year and has a modern fleet of 96 Airbus aircraft, including 23 long-haul and 73 short-haul aircraft. The hub in Rome offers ideal conditions for expanding the joint route network towards Africa and Latin America, thus providing customers with improved connections to the southern hemisphere. ITA Airways currently serves a total of 69 destinations.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Commission will assess the suitability of remedy takers in the context of a separate buyer approval procedure.\n\nOn January 23, 2024, the Commission opened an investigation to assess if Lufthansa's acquisition of a stake in ITA may restrict competition on certain routes in the market for passenger air transport services in and out of Italy.\n\nThe Commission is concerned that customers may face increased prices or decreased quality of services after the transaction.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_length", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flight length"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITA_Airways", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITA Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linate_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linate Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Economy_and_Finance_(Italy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-stop_flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-stop flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/images/v4/RTTNews-logo-512x512.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701694", "eventUri": "eng-9701694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

This will lead to increased frequencies of nonstop flights and/or improved connections for one-stop flights on each of the routes,\" it says.\n\n\"In its assessment, the Commission took into account the fact that the ministry of economy and finance will retain a controlling stake in ITA after the transaction and will continue to have incentives to have ITA compete against Lufthansa's joint venture partners in North America, at least until ITA is integrated into the joint venture.\"", "source": {"uri": "flightglobal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Flight Global"}, "authors": [{"uri": "graham_dunn@flightglobal.com", "name": "Graham Dunn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lufthansa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_length", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flight length"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linate_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Linate Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITA_Airways", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITA Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transatlantic flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interlining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1120xAny/3/0/7/103307_itaairwaysa320neo_672882.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701694", "eventUri": "eng-9701694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Critics warn that these measures will prohibitively increase costs for consumers.\n\nAccording to Dudley Shanley, an analyst at Goodbody, \"it is logical to assume that other airlines will follow Lufthansa's lead as it looks to pass on the increasing cost of environmental regulations in the EU.\"\n\nWillie Walsh, director general at the International Air Transport Association, declared last year that the airline industry would be ready to accept the fact that SAF would always be more costly than oil-based jet fuel.\n\nLufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr warned last year the EU targets would be difficult to accomplish and indicated that higher costs would be passed on to customers.\n\nThe price increase will cover part of these expenses for 2025 and will cover all airlines in the Lufthansa Group except for Eurowings tickets sold directly by the company, a spokesperson stated.\n\nOn short and medium-haul flights, the fares will increase by up to five euros ($5.36) in economy and seven euros ($7.5) for business class. On long-haul flights, costs will rise between 18 euros ($19.3) and 36 euros ($38.59) for business fares and up to 72 euros for first-class fares beginning in 2025.\n\nA spokesperson said the move was not related to Lufthansa's huge labor costs following debilitating strikes earlier this year that led to the airline releasing a profit warning in front of its first-quarter financial reports. The spokesperson added that the extra costs were not expected to increase further for the time being.\n\nWatch the video below about a Lufthansa aircraft laying out some climate change over

Whilst ITA is performing well today, ITA's long-term sustainability as a stand-alone carrier would have remained highly uncertain absent the transaction.\n\nThe Commission's investigation\n\nDuring its in-depth investigation, the Commission gathered extensive information and feedback from market participants and other stakeholders, including from rival airlines, airports, business customers, consumer and passenger associations, as well as from individual consumers who reached out to the Commission.\n\nFollowing its market investigation, the Commission had concerns that the transaction, as initially notified, would have:\n\nReduced competition on a certain number of short-haul routes connecting Italy with countries in Central Europe through non-stop and one-stop flights. On such routes: (i) Lufthansa and ITA compete head-to-head or would have likely competed head-to-head soon; and (ii) competition is limited and comes primarily from low-cost carriers, such as Ryanair, who in many cases operate from more remote airports.Reduced competition on a limited number of long-haul routes between Italy and the US and Canada. Given that Lufthansa and its joint venture partners United Airlines and Air Canada coordinate on price, capacity, and scheduling, and share revenues, the Commission treats the activities of ITA, Lufthansa and its joint venture partners as those of a single entity when assessing this transaction. ITA and Lufthansa's joint venture partners compete head-to-head with non-stop flights on these routes and competition from other airlines is limited.Created or strengthened ITA's dominant position at the Milan-Linate airport, which could have made it harder for rivals to provide passenger air transport services from and to Milan-Linate.\n\nThe proposed remedies\n\nTo address the Commission's competition concerns, Lufthansa and the MEF submitted a remedy package consisting of:\n\nCommitments for short-haul routes: Lufthansa and the MEF will make available to one or two rival airlines the necessary assets to enable them to start non-stop flights between Rome or Milan and certain airports in Central Europe. Remedy takers would need to operate on those routes for a certain minimum period. Lufthansa and the MEF will also ensure that one of those rival airlines will have access to ITA's domestic network to offer indirect connections between certain airports in Central Europe and certain Italian cities other than Rome and Milan.Commitments for long-haul routes: The merged company will enter into agreements with rivals to improve their competitiveness on the long-haul routes of concern, for instance through interlining agreements or slot swaps. This will lead to increased frequencies of non-stop flights and/or improved connections for one-stop flights on each of the routes. In its assessment, the Commission took into account the fact that the MEF will retain a controlling stake in ITA after the transaction and will continue to have incentives to have ITA compete against Lufthansa's joint venture partners in North America, at least until ITA is integrated into the joint venture.Commitments for Milan Linate airport: Lufthansa and MEF will transfer take-off and landing slots at Linate airport to the remedy takers for the short-haul routes. The number of slots to be divested exceeds what is necessary to operate the short-haul routes as well as the number of slots that the transaction would have added to ITA's portfolio. This will allow the remedy taker to establish a sustainable base at Linate airport and to potentially offer its own one-stop connections between Italy and Central Europe.\n\nPursuant to the commitments, Lufthansa and the MEF can only implement the transaction following the Commission's approval of suitable remedy takers for each of the short-haul, long-haul and Milan Linate commitments. The Commission will assess the suitability of remedy takers in the context of a separate buyer approval procedure.\n\nThese commitments fully address the competition concerns identified by the Commission.\n\nTherefore, the Commission concluded that the transaction, as modified by the commitments, would no longer raise competition concerns. The decision is conditional upon full compliance with the commitments. Under supervision of the Commission, an independent trustee will monitor their implementation.\n\nCompanies and products\n\nITA, headquartered in Italy, is a full-service carrier with domestic and international operations in passenger and cargo air transport. ITA operates a hub-and-spoke network with its principal hubs in Rome and Milan. ITA was created by the Italian State in October 2020. ITA is a member of the SkyTeam alliance.\n\nLufthansa, headquartered in Germany, is a global full-service carrier with domestic and international operations in passenger and cargo air transport. Lufthansa also operates a hub-and-spoke network with its principal hubs in Frankfurt, Munich, Zurich, Vienna and Brussels. Its subsidiaries include Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, Swiss International Airlines and Air Dolomiti. Lufthansa is a member of the Star Alliance, of a transatlantic joint venture with United Airlines and Air Canada and of a joint venture with All Nippon Airways for routes between the EEA and Japan.\n\nMEF carries out the tasks and responsibilities of the Italian government in the fields of economic policy, financial policy, budgeting, and tax policies. MEF holds shareholdings in public and strategic companies in Italy, among others in the transport sector, and it is currently the sole shareholder in ITA. The companies in which MEF has shareholdings are active worldwide.\n\nMerger control rules and procedure\n\nThe Commission has the duty to assess mergers and acquisitions involving companies with a turnover above certain thresholds (see Article 1 of the EU Merger Regulation) and to prevent concentrations that would significantly impede effective competition in the European Economic Area or any substantial part of it.\n\nThe vast majority of notified mergers do not pose competition problems and are cleared after a routine review. From the moment a transaction is notified, the Commission generally has 25 working days to decide whether to grant approval (Phase I) or to start an in-depth investigation (Phase II).\n\nIn addition to this proposed transaction, there is currently one ongoing Phase II merger investigation: the proposed acquisition of Air Europa by IAG.\n\n/Public Release.

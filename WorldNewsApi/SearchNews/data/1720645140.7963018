{"id": 231444032, "title": "Rishi Sunak's shocking D-Day week makes Tory election fight even tougher, Laura Kuenssberg writes", "text": "And yet - take a breath, repeat after me - there are still four weeks to run. One minister says that when they are knocking on doors, there are still undecided voters who can shift \u2013 another says \u201cthe polling feels worse than the doorsteps\u201d. Next week we\u2019ll see the party manifestoes - the Conservatives expected on Tuesday, and Labour on Thursday. They will be a total contrast. The Tories are presenting a longer and longer list of plans designed to appeal to their former core backers \u2013 but don\u2019t expect a shopping list from Labour. They will put forward plans that are deliberately familiar, with a message of change and reform. No traditional big cheques for public services. The party top brass does not want to have a fight about how much money they will spend on public services, and will stick to making their case that the Conservatives have botched the economy. One source claims they can\u2019t have an argument about how to slice up the pie of spending because \u201cthe problem we have in this country is the Tories have eaten all the pies and burnt down the kitchen too\u201d. After the last few days, there is a challenge for the Tories to grapple back some of the agenda, to change the conversation away from the Normandy blunder. As the national campaign falters, some candidates tell me they are already shifting some of their plea to voters on the doorstep. Following the example of what one describes as \u201csmarter Labour MPs in 2017\u201d, they shift the message to: \u201cThere is going to be a landslide, surely you don\u2019t want that, that\u2019s not good for the country, and why would you want to lose your local champion?\u201d It\u2019s hard for Conservative politicians to say that explicitly in public, as it acknowledges their rivals are on course to win big. But a party campaign source acknowledged they\u2019d be trying to \u201cwarn people about what a big Labour majority would do\u201d. Some of the party\u2019s online content is already talking about \u201cholding Labour to account\u201d \u2013 the implication of that, of course, is a tacit acknowledgement they\u2019re likely to win. But in political times, the election is practically years away. Remember too, last weekend it was Labour on the back foot, grappling to contain rows about candidates and the veteran MP Diane Abbott. Rishi Sunak has had a shocker this week \u2013 but a hopeful member of the government told me that \u201cKeir Starmer might have a bad day. A member of the shadow cabinet might say something completely idiotic\u2026 so we can either just start ripping our own hair out and talking about how awful it is or trying to get on with fighting an election.\u201d But there is no doubt that after the last 48 hours, fighting that election has become harder.

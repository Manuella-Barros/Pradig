Accountability Bureau (NAB) will investigate four corruption references against the Sharif family, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, Captain (retired) Safdar and others.\n\nMoreover, a group of investigators of its Lahore bureau has also reached Islamabad in this regard last Tuesday, The Nation has learnt.\n\nThe Supreme Court in its decision in the Panama Papers case had ordered the NAB to file corruption references against the ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif, his children, Ishaq Dar and others in the Rawalpindi/Islamabad accountability court within six weeks.\n\nWell-placed sources informed The Nation that four cases would be distributed among four sub teams of the bureau and every team would comprise an investigation officer, a case officer and a director.\n\nThey said that those teams would work under the directions of the director-general Rawalpindi and Lahore.\n\nThey said that the case officers would belong to the legal wing who would file the cases on the recommendations of the investigation officers.\n\nDG NAB Rawalpindi Nasir Iqbal had constituted a five-member investigation team headed by Additional Director Mohammad Rizwan and four deputy directors, Mehboob Alam, Muhammad Zubair, Aamir Marth and Asma Chaudhry to probe the two cases assigned to them.\n\nOf the four references, two references have been assigned to the NAB Rawalpindi and another two references to the NAB Lahore.\n\nSources said that a three-member team headed by Nazeer Ahmed Olakh, director NAB Lahore has joined the NAB Rawalpindi Bureau investigation team to set future strategy as to how to investigate the cases of the Sharif family, Ishaq Dar and others.\n\nThey said that two Investigation officers Nadir Khan and Imran Dogar would assist Olakh in Maryam Nawaz and Ishaq Dar case.\n\nThey said that the both teams would go through the joint investigation team report.\n\nThe NAB had requested the Supreme Court to provide it access to volume-10 of the JIT report for effective investigation but the SC rejected the request.\n\nA senior official of the NAB claimed that the bureau could not decide yet to probe the references further or were the evidences collected by the JIT against Sharif family and others would be adequate.\n\nHe said that investigation teams of both the bureaus would also discuss it with the monitoring SC judge in the next meeting, which was expected by the end of this week.\n\nThe official said that if the bureau did not rely on the JIT report and launched a new investigation in those cases than it would be difficult to file the four references within a period of six weeks.\n\nEarlier, NAB DG (Operation) Zahir Shah informed the NAB Chairman, Qamar Zaman Chaudhry, in a meeting that numbers of evidences had been collected in Hudaibiya Paper Mills case by the JIT.\n\nWhen The Nation contacted NAB spokesperson Asim Ali Nawazish through a text message said that no investigation team had come to Islamabad from Lahore.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Crime Agency (NCA) UK will provide training to NAB investigation officers to enhance their investigation techniques on modern lines.\n\nIn a statement, issued by the NAB on Wednesday, Osman Ahmed, country manager, NCA UK called on Qamar Zaman Chaudhry, chairman NAB at the NAB Headquarters.\n\nThe NAB chairman in his remarks said that it was very encouraging the UK would provide training to the NAB investigation officers in order to enhance their investigation skills on modern lines.\n\nHe said that the NAB gives high value to its partnership with the NCA UK.\n\nSince anti-corruption work has no national boundaries and close cooperation between the NAB and the NCA, UK will be of great help towards nabbing corrupt.\n\nThe NAB chairman welcomed the close

Additionally, he said, the IO can also withdraw the case from the accountability court on the ground that the NAB can't pursue it for having no material to rely on.\n\nSection 18 of the NAO says that if a complaint is inquired into and investigated by the NAB and it is concluded that it was prima facie frivolous or has been filed with intent to malign or defame any person, the NAB chairman or his deputy or any officer duly authorised by the NAB chief may refer the matter to the court, and if the complainant is found guilty he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine or with both.\n\nBy filing the reference, Amir Abbas said, the apex court order will be satisfied. The judgment also ordered that the accountability court shall proceed with and decide the references within a period of six months from the date of their filing. He said that if the NAB submits a reference in the accountability court as per the court verdict despite having no enough evidence to support it, it may file a supplementary reference later.\n\nAmir Abbas said that if the NAB could not \"prepare and file\" the reference within six months as directed by the Supreme Court for not having completed its investigations, it will inform the monitoring and supervising judge about the progress it has made.\n\nThe judge, he explained, will not only \"monitor\" but also \"supervise\" the implementation of the verdict in letter and spirit and oversee the proceedings conducted by the NAB and the accountability court.\n\nTo another question, Amir Abbas said, the NAB has powers to arrest the ousted prime minister or anybody else any time during investigation, but there are instances when it has not done so in the case of former prime ministers Yusuf Raza Gilani and Raja Pervez Ashraf during investigations for its own reasons. They are facing references in accountability courts. He opined that generally accountability courts did not order the NAB to arrest any accused. He said when he recently went to court to get pre-arrest bails of the commissioner and deputy commissioner of Quetta, a few NAB vehicles were waiting outside for the rejection of the plea so that they could immediately arrest the accused.\n\nThe former prosecutor said that the NAO empowers the NAB chairman and its directors general, given this authority by him, to order the arrest of any accused.\n\nUnder section 18 of the NAO, the NAB Chairman and such members, officers or servants of the agency shall have and exercise, for the purposes of an inquiry or investigation the power to arrest any person, and for that purpose may cause the attendance of any person, and when and if the assistance of any agency, police officer or any other official or agency, as the case may be, is sought by the NAB such official or agency shall render such assistance provided that no person shall be arrested without the permission of the NAB chief or any NAB officer duly authorized by him.\n\nSection 24 says the NAB chairman shall have the power, at any stage of the inquiry or investigation under the NAO, to direct that the accused, if not already arrested, shall be arrested.\n\nThe NAO further says where the holder of a public office or any other person accused of an offence is arrested by the NAB, the NAB shall, as soon as may be, inform him of the grounds and substance on the basis of which he has been arrested and produce him before the accountability court within a period of twenty-four hours of arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court and such person shall, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, be liable to be detained in the NAB custody for the purpose of inquiry and investigation for a period not exceeding ninety days and the court may remand an accused person to custody not exceeding fifteen days at a time and for every subsequent remand it shall record reasons.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T00:43:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1467, "textStart": 1460, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-28", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367770", "time": "00:43:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367770", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "48315", "label": {"eng": "Quetta"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quetta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "48650", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303132", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Judge"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge", "score": 3}, {"id": "303289", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "score": 5}, {"id": "303861", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "score": 3}, {"id": "307776", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nawaz Sharif"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif", "score": 4}, {"id": "307987", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "score": 5}, {"id": "310334", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "score": 3}, {"id": "342037", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Prima facie"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie", "score": 3}, {"id": "363545", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "National Accountability Bureau"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Accountability_Bureau", "score": 5}, {"id": "383719", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Yousaf Raza Gillani"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yousaf_Raza_Gillani", "score": 2}, {"id": "513232", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Judiciary of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_of_Pakistan", "score": 4}, {"id": "591692", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Raja Pervaiz Ashraf"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raja_Pervaiz_Ashraf", "score": 2}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "00:43:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "NAB has no option but to file references against Sharifs: ex-official", "originalArticle": null}

In what capacity he issued the 'orders' is not yet clear.\n\nHow we knew he was sick, because Nawaz Sharif cancelled his visit to Lala Musa and Wazirabad with some spokesperson saying that Shahbaz Sharif was sick.\n\nReportedly, Shahbaz Sharif and Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan had detailed discussions, probably on phone, and agreed that a no-confrontation policy best suited the party and the ousted PM in the present circumstances.\n\nNisar was attacked by Dawn leaks victim Pervaiz Rashid publicly and there were reports Nisar may respond at a news conference on Sunday. The hawks-doves divide could then be called official and public.\n\nInterestingly, before the reference against Justice Khosa was sent to the SC registrar, it was released, or partly leaked to the media, and was all over the place, though officially it had not been sent. Politics was written on each page, without doubt.\n\nLater on Saturday evening, after the alleged leaked copies of the reference had circulated all over, a spokesman of the NA speaker said, \"He had not filed any reference.\"\n\nIn yet other development, NAB had reportedly decided that the references against Nawaz Sharif and family would not be delayed and, as per SC directives, would be filed even if the Sharif family refused to appear or boycotted the proceedings. As part of the fast-moving chess pieces, the NAB chairman was proceeding abroad and may not be available for a week or 10 days. He had earlier been reported to have met Senate Chairman Raza Rabbani for three hours, quietly, as nothing was officially said after the meeting.\n\nAttacking the judge who first disqualified Nawaz on April 20 in his dissent note, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq has not mentioned anything about the ousted PM but he thinks the office of the speaker has been degraded.\n\n\"To label the speaker as a nominee or loyalist of the PM is a misstatement and contrary to the facts. It is also tantamount to disparagement and breach of privilege of the august National Assembly\" is Ayaz Sadiq's main grievance, at least in the portion that was made public.\n\n\"The honourable judge is either totally ignorant of the provisions of the constitution or he has been prejudiced by his pre-inclination to condemn the offices of the state,\" say some parts of the alleged reference.\n\nCuriously, Page-2 of the supposed reference was not included in the leaked portions while Page-5 where signatures would be affixed was also deleted. So it was a deliberate job for tactical purposes.\n\nBy releasing and retracting some of its contents to the media, the PML-N hawks have stated their intentions in no vague terms.\n\nThe party, it appears, will fight the judiciary, NAB or anyone else to delay the convictions of Nawaz Sharif and family in accountability courts and try to break or split the 5-member bench, which found him guilty.\n\nThe NAB, under Chairman Qamar Zaman, is also playing games quietly.\n\nAccording to insiders, a lot of time has been wasted out of the six weeks that the SC gave to prepare and file the references. Then, in a hurry, notices were issued, the Sharif family was summoned, a NAB team was even sent to Lahore, although other PMs in the past had to come to Rawalpindi to appear before NAB.\n\nThis haste and unofficial statements to the media that 'no extension would be sought to file the references' indicate that \"hastily and shabbily cooked up\" references may be filed, that may be thrown out later by the higher courts on points of law.\n\nThe process has also been hampered by the absence of the supervising judge who will look at everything when he returns from vacation. So either he will have to agree to what the NAB puts in front of him or will have to give more time for a better job.\n\nInsiders say the law provides that the NAB investigation officer (IO) has to call the accused and ask them detailed questions, confront them with facts and then write a report.\n\nThey say the JIT report was only a \"fact finding exercise\" and cannot replace the \"investigation report\" of the IO, as provided in NAB law. If the NAB uses the JIT report as the \"IO's investigation\" and the accused do not appear before the IO, this flaw would later be exploited by the accused to their benefit.\n\nIt has been reported that the members of the JIT have refused to appear before NAB as witnesses, so whatever they have gathered in the 10 volumes would not be authenticated in the NAB references. It would become a piece of evidence similar to the Qatari letter.\n\nThese loopholes are being deliberately left unplugged and this is a serious matter for the SC bench and the supervisory judge of the SC to look into.\n\nBy politicising the cases, by boycotting the NAB, by attacking the judges of the 5-member bench, by putting pressure on the SC to take up the review petition quickly, Nawaz and his legal team have come up with the strategy to delay matters and force the \"establishment\" to come to terms, a la a NRO.\n\nThe so-called establishment is double minded, many analysts agree, on whether to continue with this soft approach towards the Sharif family or to take a hard line.\n\nThe soft approach is visible. Nothing has been done by NAB to treat the Sharifs as accused of serious corruption, while in contrast, on Saturday, arrest warrants were issued against the entire MQM leadership in Karachi just because they had violated the \"loudspeaker ban\" months ago.\n\nThe basic strategic flaw in the entire episode has been a divided law enforcement establishment. While the PM at the top was removed, his entire support structure, his protocols, his privileges, his security and the federal and Punjab governments run by his family were intact and were allowed to treat him as the PM, despite his ouster by the SC.\n\nNowhere in the world would this be possible allowing a disqualified politician to act as the de-facto PM. But in the case of Nawaz the entire new cabinet has expressed full confidence and pledged to follow him and his policies.\n\nThat is the real dilemma and the sooner it is resolved, the quicker will things get settled.\n\nOtherwise a dysfunctional, handicapped Abbasi government at the centre, run by remote from Raiwind, will be unable to handle the enormous economic, security, regional and international challenges, pushing the country deeper into the dark hole.

Prajwal, facing charges of sexually assaulting women, went to Germany just before allegations surfaced against him.Parameshwara took a dig at External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar after the latter stated that the request to cancel Prajwal\u2019s diplomatic passport was received only on May 21. The Karnataka Home Minister questioned the status of a letter sent by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 1.\"As far as I know, we have not received any information or letter so far from the Centre,\" Parameshwara said, hinting at Jaishankar's claim that the Centre was taking action but was not provided any written communication.Siddaramaiah wrote to PM Modi on May 1, seeking the cancellation of Prajwal\u2019s diplomatic passport. The state\u2019s Special Investigation Team (SIT), probing the charges, also wrote to the Centre with the same request.\"Where is the (response to) first (CM's) letter? When a Chief Minister writes a letter to the Prime Minister's Office, it has to get its due respect. That did not happen. The External Affairs Minister is saying that they got the letter from the state on May 21, so we have to ask where the first letter go? They are taking action, it is good, let them take it, but him saying that we (the state) have sent a letter now and not earlier, is not right,\" Parameshwara was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Siddaramaiah sent a second letter to the Prime Minister on May 22, urging prompt action to cancel Prajwal\u2019s diplomatic passport. The 33-year-old Janata Dal (Secular) leader, who is contesting on Hassan Lok Sabha seat, left for Germany on April 27, a day after voting happened in Hassan.Interpol has issued a Blue Corner Notice for information on Prajwal\u2019s whereabouts, following a request from the SIT via the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). A Special Court for Elected Representatives issued an arrest warrant for Prajwal on May 18.Published By: Vadapalli Nithin KumarPublished On: May 26, 2024ALSO READ | Prajwal Revanna case: 5 accused of circulating obscene clips seek anticipatory bailMust Watch", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/karnataka/story/prajwal-revanna-case-karnataka-minister-g-parameshwara-slams-centre-responding-siddaramaiah-letter-2544037-2024-05-26\"> <img align=\"left\" hspace=\"2\" height=\"180\" width=\"305\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/g-parameshwara-20494528-16x9.png?VersionId=zmXOLW2TssvMNcFjSE7XpuPuiBom.RB4\"> </a> Karnataka accuses Centre of inaction over Prajwal Revanna's diplomatic passport", "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india/karnataka/story/prajwal-revanna-case-karnataka-minister-g-parameshwara-slams-centre-responding-siddaramaiah-letter-2544037-2024-05-26", "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/g-parameshwara-20494528-16x9.png?VersionId=zmXOLW2TssvMNcFjSE7XpuPuiBom.RB4?size=1280:720", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:45:59", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.611}

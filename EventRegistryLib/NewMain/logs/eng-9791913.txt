The Tesla chief wrote this in response to a video on the platform that claimed that the riots were in response to \"migration and open borders\". This comes a week after riots broke out in the country after the murder of three girls last Monday and the dissemination of false information about the suspect.\n\nThe UK prime minister's spokesperson dismissed Musk's remarks, stating there is \"no justification for comments like that\" and warning that \"anyone who is whipping up violence online will face the full force of the law.\"\n\n\"What we've seen in this country is organised thuggery, which has no place on our streets or online. As the Home Secretary said, we're dealing with a minority of thugs who do not represent Britain. In response, we've witnessed the best of our communities coming together to clean up the mess and disruption caused by those who do not speak for our country,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nElon Musk's response came after a video posted by the Libs of TikTok account, initially shared by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, showed rioting targeting mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers. Robinson was banned from the platform in 2018 when it was known as Twitter. However, Musk restored Robinson's account last year under his new ownership of X. Since then, Musk has interacted with Robinson on the platform. Musk has also amplified various such accounts posting incendiary content about the violence by commenting or adding exclamation marks to their posts.\n\nElon Musk also responded to a social media post by Keir Starmer that condemned violence against Muslims. Starmer stated that the unrest \"is not protest, it is pure violence,\" and emphasised, \"We will not tolerate attacks on mosques or on Muslim communities.\" Musk countered with, \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on all communities?\"\n\nOn Monday evening, Technology Secretary Peter Kyle also met with the leaders of TikTok, Meta, Google, and X to reinforce their obligation to combat the spread of hateful misinformation and incitement. After the meeting, Kyle remarked, \"There is a significant amount of content circulating that platforms need to be dealing with at pace. Different companies take different approaches and I expect platforms to ensure that those seeking to spread hate online are not being facilitated and have nowhere to hide.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libs_of_TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Libs of TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson_(activist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Robinson (activist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202408/elon-musk-warns-of-inevitable-civil-war-in-uk-as-immigrant-fueled-riots-erupts-under-new-left-wing-065019664-16x9.jpg?VersionId=OaJhEGc2JTwGBpRuKjippjiM9hwDw.p.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791913", "eventUri": "eng-9791913", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

He also pinned it to his profile so it is the first thing his 193million followers see when on his page.\n\nMinutes earlier the Tesla boss also shared a video of a Exeter man believed to be named Thomas Dunne being arrested after a complaint made about his comments of social media.\n\nMusk shared it to launch another attack on the UK and said: 'Arrested for making comments on Facebook! Is this Britain or the Soviet Union?'\n\nDowning Street rebuked Elon Musk, the owner of X, for using his platform to claim that 'civil war is inevitable' - so the billionaire has hit back again\n\nSir Keir Starmer and Downing Street last night hit out at the billionaire for suggesting 'civil war is inevitable' following days of rioting fuelled by disinformation on social media after the deaths of three little girls in Southport last week.\n\nAsked about Mr Musk's comments today, Justice minister Heidi Alexander told BBC Breakfast 'everyone should be calling for calm' and that Musk in particular 'has a responsibility given the huge platform he has, and so, to be honest, I think his comments are pretty deplorable'.\n\nThe Prime Minister's spokesman yesterday said there was 'no justification for comments like that', prompting Mr Musk to reply directly by responding to a video posted by the PM stressing attacks on mosques and Muslims would not be tolerated.The mogul, who is the richest man in the world with more than $200billion and has 193million followers on X, asked\n\nSir Keir: 'Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?'\n\nElon Musk hit out at the UK's police last night as he responded to an offensive cartoon\n\nHe added: 'We will not tolerate attacks on mosques or on Muslim communities.' In response, Mr Musk wrote: 'Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?'\n\nMusk had earlier replied to a tweet by right-wing commentator Ashley St Clair, who said far-right rioting was down to 'the effects of mass migration', by suggesting 'civil war is inevitable'\n\nOvernight he then responded to a cartoon featuring offensive caricatures of two men, one wearing a headband featuring the flag of Pakistan, holding a knife, alongside a police officer with the caption: 'We are here to protect you.'\n\nUnderneath is a man saying: 'I don't want my children to get stabbed', while a police officer accuses him of being a 'Nazi'.\n\nThe user who posted the cartoon wrote 'The UK police are compromised' - to which Musk responded: 'Does seem one-sided'.\n\nSo-called 'two tier policing' is a claim often used by the far-right to imply that police treat certain groups of people in different ways.\n\nMs Alexander attacked Mr Musk again in a separate interview this morning.\n\nShe told Times Radio: 'I agree with what the spokesperson on behalf of the Prime Minister was saying yesterday. I do think these comments are unjustifiable.\n\n'If you have got a platform, a large social media platform, then you have also got a responsibility.\n\nRead More EDWARD LUCAS: Musk should be in the dock over lies that led thugs to rampage through our streets\n\n'I think it is deeply irresponsible, I think everyone should be appealing for calm.\n\n'Use of language such as a 'civil war' is in no way acceptable.

In fact the 17-year-old suspect was born in Cardiff and has no known links to Islam.\n\nLast night hundreds of far-Right activists and anti-racist protesters came face-to-face in Plymouth, where beer bottles, flares and a crutch were flung through the air, leaving police officers injured.\n\nAnd in Birmingham a Sky News van was attacked by a knife-wielding man after members of the Muslim community gathered amid claims far-Right groups would target the Small Heath area.\n\nPolice have also been warned of alleged plans by far-Right groups to hit dozens of immigration targets across Britain on Wednesday night.\n\nBe the first to commentBe one of the first to commentCommentsWhat is your opinion on Elon Musk\u00bfs comments about the ongoing riots in UK?Comment now\n\nViolence erupted again in Belfast last night amid ongoing rioting around the UK\n\nThe clash came as Cabinet ministers blamed social media for allowing hate and fake news to be spread, leading to violent rioting by the far-Right that have seen migrant hotels and mosques attacked in the wake of the Southport stabbings a week ago. Pictured: Far-right protesters in Plymouth on Monday night\n\nPolice were out in force and detained far-right protesters in Plymouth on Monday night\n\nThe violence has seen damage to homes, businesses, hotels and even a library\n\nMinisters have said X has helped stoke online hate and refused to delete racist comments while allowing controversial activists such as Tommy Robinson and Andrew Tate back on the platform. Pictured: Protesters in Plymouth\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper yesterday said social media has put 'rocket boosters' under such groups.\n\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting warned that the spread of disinformation online is 'an existential threat to democracy'.\n\nHe told the Edinburgh Fringe festival: 'We've got to wake up, not just as Britain but as democracies collectively, to what is actually a threat to our democracy, to our national security, to trust in politics, which is already kind of rock bottom anyway.'\n\nAnd Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said: 'Responsibility for harmful social media content principally rests with the individuals and groups who create it.\n\n'But it is undeniable that social media has provided a platform for this hate.'\n\nBIRMINGHAM: Men gesture to the

emergency Cobra meeting about the riots, Downing Street also put online agitators on notice that they will be brought to justice alongside the rioters themselves.\n\n'Anyone who is guilty of criminal behaviour online, anyone who is whipping up violence online, will face the full force of law.'\n\nThe landmark Online Safety Act passed by the previous government will mean tech giants face multi-million pound fines if they fail to protect users from illegal content such as messages provoking hatred, disorder or violence.\n\nRead More Keir Starmer slaps down Elon Musk over 'civil war is

guidance.\n\nHowever, the watchdog said platforms can act now rather than waiting for the law to come into force.\n\nX has been accused of refusing to delete racist comments while allowing controversial activists such as Tommy Robinson and Andrew Tate back on the platform.\n\nThe false claim that a Muslim asylum seeker was the suspect in the Southport stabbings was first made on X by a British woman before going viral when it was spread by Russia-linked fake news website Channel3 Now.\n\nAnd, as the Mail revealed, English Defence League founder Mr Robinson was stoking the race riots with a series of video rants on X while he was on holiday in Cyprus.\n\nBut Mr Musk himself has made at least ten comments about the riots - mostly replying to other users and thereby massively increasing their reach.\n\nMr Musk used his X social media site, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday to reply to a post that blamed 'mass migration and open borders' for unrest in the UK\n\nAfter a prominent account posted a video of rioters setting off fireworks at police and a Right-wing commentator blamed mass migration, Mr Musk replied: 'Civil war is inevitable.'\n\nAsked about the remark, Sir Keir's spokesman said: 'There's no justification for comments like that.\n\n'And what we've seen is organised violent thuggery that has no place on our streets or online.'\n\nYesterday Sir Keir posted a video condemning the violence and warning that criminal justice will be 'ramped up'.\n\nHe added: 'We will not tolerate attacks on mosques or on Muslim communities.'\n\nIn response, Mr Musk wrote, in a comment that received 70,000 likes and 12,000 reposts in three hours: 'Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on communities?'\n\nThe X owner also agreed that UK police 'seem one-sided' in response to a cartoon accusing officers of going soft on violent Islamists.\n\nAnd he added: 'If incompatible cultures are brought together without assimilation, conflict is inevitable.'\n\nExpert on online disinformation Dr Marc Owen Jones said: 'Musk is definitely fanning the flames... he is clearly contributing to the problem.'\n\nX did not respond to requests to comment.", "source": {"uri":

with Elon Musk over claim 'civil war is inevitable'", "body": "Wes Streeting has warned disinformation is 'an existential threat to democracy'\n\nSir Keir Starmer and Elon Musk were last night embroiled in a war of words over the race riots raging in Britain.\n\nDowning Street rebuked the owner of X, formerly Twitter, for using his platform to claim that 'civil war is inevitable'.\n\nThe Prime Minister's spokesman said there was 'no justification for comments like that'.\n\nA few hours later, Mr Musk - the richest man in the world worth more than $200billion - criticised Sir Keir directly by responding to a video posted by the PM stressing attacks on mosques and Muslims would not be tolerated.\n\nMr Musk, who has 193million global followers, replied, asking Sir Keir: 'Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on communities?'\n\nDowning Street rebuked Elon Musk, the owner of X, formerly Twitter , for using his platform to claim that 'civil war is inevitable'\n\nThe clash came as Cabinet ministers blamed social media for allowing hate and fake news to be spread, leading to violent protests by the far-Right that have seen migrant hotels and mosques attacked in the wake of the Southport stabbings a week ago.\n\nLast night hundreds of far-Right activists and anti-racist protesters came face-to-face in Plymouth, where beer bottles, flares and a crutch were flung through the air, leaving police officers injured.\n\nAnd in Birmingham a Sky News van was attacked by a knife-wielding man after members of the Muslim community gathered amid claims far-Right groups would target the Small Heath area.\n\nPolice have also been warned of alleged plans by far-Right groups to hit dozens of immigration targets across Britain on Wednesday night.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper yesterday claimed social media has put 'rocket boosters' under such groups.\n\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting warned that the spread of disinformation online is 'an existential threat to democracy'.\n\nHe told the Edinburgh Fringe festival: 'We've got to wake up, not just as Britain but as democracies collectively, to what is actually a threat to our democracy, to our national security, to trust in politics, which is already kind of rock bottom anyway.'\n\nAnd Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said: 'Responsibility for harmful social media content principally rests with the individuals and groups who create it.\n\n'But it is undeniable that social media has provided a platform for this hate.'\n\nHe held individual meetings with bosses from US-based X, Facebook, Google and TikTok yesterday to make clear their responsibility to 'stop the spread of hateful misinformation and incitement'.\n\nNo 10 said action taken by the firms so far has not gone far enough.\n\n'There is more that they can and should be doing,' Sir Keir's spokesman said.\n\nAfter the first emergency Cobra meeting about the riots, Downing Street also put online agitators on notice that they will be brought to justice alongside the rioters themselves.\n\n'Anyone who is guilty of criminal behaviour online, anyone who is whipping up violence online, will face the full force of law.'\n\nThe landmark Online Safety Act passed by the previous government will mean tech giants face multi-million pound fines if they fail to protect users from illegal content such as messages provoking hatred, disorder or violence.\n\nBut the duties on the firms will not come into force for several months, as regulator Ofcom is still consulting on its codes of practice and guidance.\n\nHowever, the watchdog said platforms can act now rather than waiting for the law to come into force.\n\nX has been accused of refusing to delete racist comments while allowing controversial activists such as Tommy Robinson and Andrew Tate back on the platform.\n\nThe false claim that a Muslim asylum seeker was the suspect in the Southport stabbings was first made on X by a British woman before going viral when it was spread by Russia-linked fake news website Channel3 Now.\n\nAnd, as the Mail revealed, English Defence League founder Mr Robinson was stoking the race riots with a series of video rants on X while he was on holiday in Cyprus.\n\nBut Mr Musk himself has made at least ten comments about the riots - mostly replying to other users and thereby massively increasing their reach.\n\nAfter a prominent account posted a video of rioters setting off fireworks at police and a Right-wing commentator blamed mass migration, Mr Musk replied: 'Civil war is inevitable.'\n\nAsked about the remark, Sir Keir's spokesman said: 'There's no justification for comments like that.\n\n'And what we've seen is organised violent thuggery that has no place on our streets or online.'\n\nYesterday Sir Keir posted a video condemning the violence and warning that criminal justice will be 'ramped up'.\n\nHe added: 'We will not tolerate attacks on mosques or on Muslim communities.'\n\nIn response, Mr Musk wrote, in a comment that received 70,000 likes and 12,000 reposts in three hours: 'Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on communities?'\n\nThe X owner also agreed that UK police 'seem one-sided' in response to a cartoon accusing officers of going soft on violent Islamists.\n\nAnd he added: 'If incompatible cultures are brought together without assimilation, conflict is inevitable.'\n\nExpert on online disinformation Dr Marc Owen Jones said: 'Musk is definitely fanning the flames... he is clearly contributing to the problem.'\n\nX did not respond to requests to comment.", "source": {"uri":

Devon and Cornwall police said that one of its vans was damaged and officers were met with \"a level of violence\".\n\nIn Birmingham, hundreds of Muslims, including men in balaclavas and masks, formed a protective ring around a local mosque and shops amid rumours of a planned march by the far-Right.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria, and the United Arab Emirates - all of which have majority Muslim populations - as well as Australia, issued travel alerts telling their citizens to be careful if they were travelling to the UK amid the riots.\n\nHowever, Downing Street rebuffed calls for the Army to be deployed or Parliament to be recalled in response to the clashes, seen in at least 16 British towns and cities in the last week.\n\nSir Keir was also forced to respond to claims there was \"two-tier policing\" in Britain after Nigel Farage suggested riots over the last week had been dealt with more harshly than other recent unrest and protests.\n\nThe Prime Minister rejected the claims, and Sir Mark Rowley, the Met Police Commissioner, was forced to deny that he had intentionally knocked a microphone out of a reporter's hand when asked about the issue.\n\nThe Government has accused social media companies of fuelling the protests, which were prompted by false claims spread online that the suspect in the killing of three girls in Southport was an asylum seeker.\n\nDowning Street said on Monday that action taken by social media companies to tackle misleading and inflammatory material \"doesn't go far enough\".\n\nIt also warned that some foreign state actors were amplifying online disinformation.\n\n'Hateful misinformation'\n\nPeter Kyle, the Science Secretary, held one-on-one talks with executives from X, YouTube, Meta, Google and TikTok about the \"spread of hateful misinformation and incitement\" on the riots, insisting action must be taken \"at pace\".\n\nMr Musk is one of the US's most influential tech bosses, also owning the electric car company Tesla. He is supporting Trump's bid for the US presidency this year.\n\nHe has commented on X more than a dozen times in recent days on the UK riots.\n\nIn one post, he responded to footage allegedly from the UK that showed rioters, some masked, launching fireworks in clashes. He responded \"civil war is inevitable\" to a message about the video.\n\nLater, he responded to a message shared by Sir Keir's official account which said \"we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or on Muslim communities\".\n\nMr Musk wrote back: \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\"\n\nThe exchange seemed to be in response to Sir Keir's announcement on Sunday to offer additional security personnel to mosques at risk of being targeted.\n\nMr Musk was previously criticised for reinstating the accounts of far-Right figures including Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, in November last year.\n\nIn one post about the riots Mr Musk responded to footage shared by Robinson.\n\nDowning Street condemned Mr Musk's \"civil war\" comment.\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said on Monday: \"There's no justification for comments like that, and what we've seen in this country is organised thuggery and has no place either on our streets or online.\n\n\"As the Home Secretary said this morning, we're talking about a minority of thugs that do not speak for Britain.\n\n\"And in response, we've seen some of the best of our communities, coming out and cleaning up the mess and the disruption of those that don't speak for our country.\"\n\nMr Kyle said after holding talks with tech giants: \"There is a significant amount of content circulating that platforms need to be dealing with at pace.\n\n\"Different companies take different approaches and I expect platforms to ensure that those seeking to spread hate online are not being facilitated and have nowhere to hide.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Keir faced some criticism from senior Tories for not calling a Cobra meeting quickly enough about the riots. One was eventually held on Monday.\n\nJames Cleverly, who is running for the Tory leadership, said the Government \"should have been quicker\" in its response to riots taking place across England.",

In fact the 17-year-old suspect was born in Cardiff and has no known links to Islam.\n\nLast night hundreds of far-Right activists and anti-racist protesters came face-to-face in Plymouth, where beer bottles, flares and a crutch were flung through the air, leaving police officers injured.\n\nAnd in Birmingham a Sky News van was attacked by a knife-wielding man after members of the Muslim community gathered amid claims far-Right groups would target the Small Heath area.\n\nPolice have also been warned of alleged plans by far-Right groups to hit dozens of immigration targets across Britain on Wednesday night.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper yesterday claimed social media has put 'rocket boosters' under such groups.\n\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting warned that the spread of disinformation online is 'an existential threat to democracy'.\n\nHe told the Edinburgh Fringe festival: 'We've got to wake up, not just as Britain but as democracies collectively, to what is actually a threat to our democracy, to our national security, to trust in politics, which is already kind of rock bottom anyway.'\n\nAnd Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said: 'Responsibility for harmful social media content principally rests with the individuals and groups who create it.\n\n'But it is undeniable that social media has provided a platform for this hate.'\n\nHe held individual meetings with bosses from US-based X, Facebook, Google and TikTok yesterday to make clear their responsibility to 'stop the spread of hateful misinformation and incitement'.\n\nNo 10 said action taken by the firms so far has not gone far enough.\n\n'There is more that they can and should be doing,' Sir Keir's spokesman said.\n\nAfter the first emergency Cobra meeting about the riots, Downing Street also put online agitators on notice that they will be brought to justice alongside the rioters themselves.\n\n'Anyone who is guilty of criminal behaviour online, anyone who is whipping up violence online, will face the full force of law.'\n\nThe landmark Online Safety Act passed by the previous government will mean tech giants face multi-million pound fines if they fail to protect users from illegal content such as messages provoking hatred, disorder or violence.\n\nBut the duties on the firms will not come into force for several months, as regulator Ofcom is still consulting on its codes of practice and guidance.\n\nHowever, the watchdog said platforms can act now rather than waiting for the law to come into force.\n\nX has been accused of refusing to delete racist comments while allowing controversial activists such as Tommy Robinson and Andrew Tate back on the platform.\n\nThe false claim that a Muslim asylum seeker was the suspect in the Southport stabbings was first made on X by a British woman before going viral when it was spread by Russia-linked fake news website Channel3 Now.\n\nAnd, as the Mail revealed, English Defence League founder Mr Robinson was stoking the race riots with a series of video rants on X while he was on holiday in Cyprus.\n\nBut Mr Musk himself has made at least ten comments about the riots - mostly replying to other users and thereby massively increasing their reach.\n\nAfter a prominent account posted a video of rioters setting off fireworks at police and a Right-wing commentator blamed mass migration, Mr Musk replied: 'Civil war is inevitable.'\n\nAsked about the remark, Sir Keir's spokesman said: 'There's no justification for comments like that.\n\n'And what we've seen is organised violent thuggery that has no place on our streets or online.'\n\nYesterday Sir Keir posted a video condemning the violence and warning that criminal justice will be 'ramped up'.\n\nHe added: 'We will not tolerate attacks on mosques or on Muslim communities.'\n\nIn response, Mr Musk wrote, in a comment that received 70,000 likes and 12,000 reposts in three hours: 'Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on communities?'\n\nThe X owner also agreed that UK police 'seem one-sided' in response to a cartoon accusing officers of going soft on violent Islamists.\n\nAnd he added: 'If incompatible cultures are brought together without

Devon and Cornwall police said one of their vans was damaged and officers were met with \"a level of violence\".\n\nIn Birmingham, hundreds of Muslims, including men in balaclavas and masks, formed a protective ring around a local mosque and shops amid rumours of a planned march by the far-right.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates - all of which have majority Muslim populations - as well as Australia, issued travel alerts telling their citizens to be careful if they were travelling to the UK amid the riots.\n\nHowever, Downing Street rebuffed calls for the army to be deployed or parliament to be recalled in response to the clashes, seen in at least 16 British towns and cities in the last week.\n\nStarmer was also forced to respond to claims there was \"two-tier policing\" in Britain after Nigel Farage suggested riots over the last week had been dealt with more harshly than other recent unrest and protests.\n\nThe prime minister rejected the claims, and Sir Mark Rowley, the Met Police commissioner, was forced to deny that he had intentionally knocked a microphone out of a reporter's hand when asked about the issue.\n\nThe government has accused social media companies of fuelling the protests, which were prompted by false claims spread online that the suspect in the killing of three girls in Southport was an asylum seeker.\n\nDowning Street said on Monday action taken by social media companies to tackle misleading and inflammatory material \"doesn't go far enough\".\n\nIt also warned some foreign state actors were amplifying online disinformation.\n\nScience Secretary Peter Kyle held one-on-one talks with executives from X, YouTube, Meta, Google and TikTok about the \"spread of hateful misinformation and incitement\" regarding the riots, insisting action must be taken \"at pace\".\n\nMusk is one of the US's most influential tech bosses, also owning the electric car company Tesla. He is supporting Trump's bid for the US presidency this year.\n\nHe has commented on X more than a dozen times in recent days about the UK riots.\n\nIn one post, he responded to footage allegedly from the UK that showed rioters, some masked, launching fireworks in clashes. He responded \"civil war is inevitable\" to a message about the video.\n\nLater, he responded to a message shared by Starmer's official account which said \"we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or on Muslim communities\".\n\nMusk wrote back: \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\"\n\nThe exchange seemed to be in response to Starmer's announcement on Sunday to offer additional security personnel to mosques at risk of being targeted.\n\nMusk was previously criticised for reinstating the accounts of far-right figures including Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, in November last year. In one post about the riots, Musk responded to footage shared by Robinson.\n\nDowning Street condemned Musk's \"civil war\" comment.\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said on Monday: \"There's no justification for comments like that, and what we've seen in this country is organised thuggery and has no place either on our streets or online.\n\n\"As the home secretary said this morning, we're talking about a minority of thugs that do not speak for Britain.\n\n\"And in response, we've seen some of the best of our communities, coming out and cleaning up the mess and the disruption of those that don't speak for our country.\"\n\nKyle said after holding talks with tech giants: \"There is a significant amount of content circulating that platforms need to be dealing with at pace.\n\n\"Different companies take different approaches, and I expect platforms to ensure that those seeking to spread hate online are not being facilitated and have nowhere to hide.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Starmer faced some criticism from senior Tories for not calling a Cobra meeting quickly enough about the riots. One was eventually held on Monday.\n\nJames Cleverly, who is running for the Tory leadership, said the government \"should have been quicker\" in its response to riots taking place across England.",

He is 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, who was born in Britain.\n\nThe rioters have targeted mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers, forcing the government to provide emergency security to Islamic places of worship.\n\nIn a post on X on Monday, Starmer vowed to apply \"criminal law online as well as offline\", adding that \"we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or on Muslim communities\".\n\nMusk replied: \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\"\n\nHis original \"civil war\" post came in a reply to another X user blaming the riots on \"the effects of mass migration and open borders\".\n\nStarmer's spokesperson said Monday their was \"no justification\" for the comment.\n\nInfluencer Andrew Tate and far-right, anti-Islam figurehead Tommy Robinson are among people promoting false claims about Rudakubana on X.\n\nStarmer's spokesperson also blamed \"bot activity online\", suggesting that the false rumours could have been \"amplified

to be Muslim\".\n\nAn AI-generated image depicting Muslim men chasing a child wearing a British flag has over 900,000 views.\n\nTechnology minister Peter Kyle met representatives from TikTok, Meta,

The owner of X, formerly Twitter, is at the centre of a war of words with government after he used his platform to make a series of inflammatory claims over race riots seen on the streets of Britain in recent days.\n\nSir Keir Starmer and Downing Street yesterday hit out at the billionaire for suggesting 'civil war is inevitable' following days of rioting fuelled by disinformation on social media after the deaths of three little girls in Southport last week. The Prime Minister's spokesman said there was 'no justification for comments like that' - as his technology minister met with representatives from social networks, including X, to urge them to act on fighting online hate.\n\nA few hours later, Mr Musk - the richest man in the world worth more than $200billion - criticised Sir Keir directly by responding to a video posted by the PM stressing attacks on mosques and Muslims would not be tolerated. Mr Musk, who has 193million global followers, replied, asking Sir Keir: 'Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities? '\n\nOvernight he then responded to a cartoon featuring offensive caricatures of two men, one wearing a headband featuring the flag of Pakistan, holding a knife, alongside a police officer with the caption: 'We are here to protect you.' Underneath is a man saying: 'I don't want my children to get stabbed', while a police officer accuses him of being a 'Nazi'. The user who posted the cartoon wrote 'The UK police are compromised' - to which Musk responded: 'Does seem one-sided'.\n\nSo-called 'two tier policing' is a claim often used by the far-right in a bid to stir up racial hatred, and implies that police treat certain groups of people in different ways. The clash came as Cabinet ministers blamed social media for allowing hate and fake news to be spread, leading to violent riots by the far-Right that have seen migrant hotels and mosques attacked in the wake of the Southport stabbings a week ago.\n\nFalse claims spread rapidly on X and other social media platforms that the suspect was a Muslim asylum seeker who arrived in the UK by boat a year previously. In fact the 17-year-old suspect was born in Cardiff and has no known links to Islam. Last night hundreds of far-Right activists and anti-racist protesters came face-to-face in Plymouth, where beer bottles, flares and a crutch were flung through the air, leaving police officers injured. And in Birmingham a Sky News van was attacked by a knife-wielding man after members of the Muslim community gathered amid claims far-Right groups would target the Small Heath area.\n\nPolice have also been warned of alleged plans by far-Right groups to hit dozens of immigration targets across Britain on Wednesday night. This morning ministers continued to criticise Elon Musk for claiming 'civil war' in the UK is 'inevitable' as rioting continues. Justice minister Heidi Alexander told Times Radio: 'I agree with what the spokesperson on behalf of the Prime Minister was saying yesterday. I do think these comments are unjustifiable. If you have got a platform, a large social media platform, then you have also got a responsibility. I think it is deeply irresponsible, I think everyone should be appealing for calm. Use of language such as a 'civil war' is in no way acceptable. We are seeing police officers being seriously injured, buildings set alight, and so I really do think that everyone who has a platform should be exercising their power responsibly.'\n\nOn the media round on Tuesday she also pledged to 'take a very robust approach to social media companies'. 'There has been some welcome action where there has been automated removal of some false information, but I do think the social media companies could and should be doing more. They have got a moral responsibility not to be propagating and disseminating misleading and inflammatory content on their platforms.' Home Secretary Yvette Cooper yesterday said social media has put 'rocket boosters' under such groups. Health Secretary Wes Streeting warned that the spread of disinformation online is 'an existential threat to democracy'.\n\nHe told the Edinburgh Fringe festival: 'We've got to wake up, not just as Britain but as democracies collectively, to what is actually a threat to our democracy, to our national security, to trust in politics, which is already kind of rock bottom anyway.' And Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said: 'Responsibility for harmful social media content principally rests with the individuals and groups who create it. But it is undeniable that social media has provided a platform for this hate.' He held individual meetings with bosses from U.S.-based X, Facebook, Google and TikTok yesterday to make clear their responsibility to 'stop the spread of hateful misinformation and incitement'. No 10 said action taken by the firms so far has not gone far enough. 'There is more that they can and should be doing,' Sir Keir's spokesman said.\n\nAfter the first emergency Cobra meeting about the riots, Downing Street also put online agitators on notice that they will be brought to justice alongside the rioters themselves. 'Anyone who is guilty of criminal behaviour online, anyone who is whipping up violence online, will face the full force of law.' The landmark Online Safety Act passed by the previous government will mean tech giants face multi-million pound fines if they fail to protect users from illegal content such as messages provoking hatred, disorder or violence. But the duties on the firms will not come into force for several months, as regulator Ofcom is still consulting on its codes of practice and guidance. However, the watchdog said platforms can act now rather than waiting for the law to come into force.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Musk queried: \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on all communities?\"\n\nThis exchange followed after Starmer chaired a government emergency Cobra committee meeting addressing the riots.\n\nIn a post-meeting statement, Starmer announced the establishment of a \"standing army of duty officers\" poised to respond swiftly to any further disturbances.\n\nHe also emphasized that individuals arrested for participating in the violence would be promptly identified and face severe legal consequences.\n\nIn a pointed critique of social media platforms, Starmer stressed the importance of regulating online spaces to prevent the spread of misinformation and right-wing extremist content.\n\n\"The criminal law applies online as well as offline and I am assured that is the process that is being followed,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Justice Minister Heidi Alexander said that Elon Musk's post on his social media platform that \"civil war is inevitable\" as rioting in the UK continues is \"deeply irresponsible.\"\n\nShe told Times Radio: \"If you have got a platform, a large social media platform, then you have also got a responsibility.\"", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Times Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heidi Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/08/06/thumbs_b_c_0b70c96e888585f68c5987013eff1ee7.jpg?v=144503", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791913", "eventUri": "eng-9791913", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

However, the new inhabitant of No. 10 takes a different approach to the billionaire owner of X and Tesla. This afternoon, Keir Starmer's spokesman has slapped down Musk over comments he made online suggesting civil war in the UK was 'inevitable' following a wave of violent disorder in the past week.\n\nAsked by journalists about the remark that Musk made on his own social media platform, Starmer's spokesperson said 'there is no justification for comments like that'. They went on:\n\nWhat we've seen in this country is organized, illegal thuggery which has no place on our streets or online. We're talking about a minority of thugs that do not speak for Britain ... The prime minister doesn't share those [Musk's] sentiments.\n\nThe exchange comes as Starmer tries to show he has a grip on the issue after the violent disorder escalated over the weekend. Following scenes in Rotherham where protesters set fire to a Holiday Inn thought to be used to house asylum seekers, Starmer made a statement promising to show the full force of the law in response to 'far-right thuggery'. Today he chaired his first Cobra meeting since the violence began following the Southport stabbings last week.\n\nStarmer has promised a 'standing army' of specialist police officers to help deal with any further rioting. He has also promised to crack down on those inciting violence online. It begs the question as to whether Starmer and Musk's clash today is a taste of things to come. Musk has been criticised previously for reinstating the accounts of the far-right activist Tommy Robinson in November last year.\n\nPeter Kyle, the Technology Secretary, has said that while responsibility for harmful social media content 'principally rests' with those who create it, 'it is undeniable that social media has provided a platform for this hate'. It means there could be more to come on what the new Labour government expects from tech companies, such as the one owned by Musk.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katy_balls@spectator.us", "name": "Katy Balls", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Inn", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holiday Inn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson_(activist)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Robinson (activist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kyle_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Kyle (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standing army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2151277745.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791913", "eventUri": "eng-9791913", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

in the UK.\n\nMr Musk, the billionaire owner of X, made the comments on his social media site in response to a video of protesters shooting fireworks at police.\n\nFootage of rioters clashing with the authorities clip was quoted by Ashley St Clair, a Right-wing commentator, who blamed the unrest on \"the effects of mass migration and open borders\".\n\nMr Musk replied \"civil war is inevitable\", while also responding with an exclamation mark to a separate post of fireworks being thrown during disorder in Liverpool.\n\nAsked about the entrepreneur's remarks, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: \"There's no justification for comments like that, and what we've seen in this country is organised thuggery and has no place either on our streets or online.\n\n\"As the Home Secretary said this morning, we're talking about a minority of thugs that do not speak for Britain.\n\n\"And in response, we've seen some of the best of our communities, coming out and cleaning up the mess and the disruption of those that don't speak for our country.\"\n\nMr Musk was criticised for reinstating the accounts of far-Right figures including Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, in November last year after he rebranded X, formerly Twitter.\n\nHe engaged with a post shared by Yaxley-Lennon's account on Sunday, also responding with an exclamation mark.\n\nIn a further intervention, he claimed it is \"one-sided\" that Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, has announced emergency security measures for mosques but not churches or synagogues.\n\nIt follows unrest in which a mosque in Southport was targeted despite there being no link between the man suspected of killing three young girls at a dance class and Islam.\n\nFollowing six days of violence, Sir Keir has warned rioters they would regret taking part in clashes and vowed to do \"whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice as quickly as possible\".\n\nBut his political opponents have said he should have taken control of the situation sooner, with James Cleverly, the shadow home secretary, warning a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee was convened too late.", "source": {"uri":

In July 2023, Mr Sunak posted on X, formerly Twitter, saying it was \"wrong\" that Reform UK leader Nigel Farage had had his bank account at Coutts shut down over his political views. Mr Musk responded to the post with the message: \"Hear, hear!\".\n\nDuring their discussion in November, Mr Sunak heaped praise on Mr Musk, calling him a \"brilliant innovator and technologist\". In a post on X after the summit, Mr Musk reciprocated, saying that he was \"impressed\" by the prime minister, calling him an \"asset to the UK\".\n\nThese messages are a far cry from the series of posts Mr Musk has made over the past week about the current Prime Minister and the strong words Downing Street has issued in response.\n\nMusk questions arrest of Tommy Robinson\n\nBefore he began responding directly to the Prime Minister, Mr Musk posted multiple tweets commenting on the continuing riots in the UK and the treatment of far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\n\nOn 30 July, he responded to a video by German right-wing activist Naomi Seibt in which she criticised the fact that Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, had been arrested a few days earlier under the Terrorism Act.\n\nMr Musk responded to the video asking why Robinson had been \"defined as a terrorist\", adding: \"Has he committed a violent crime or expressed clear intent to commit a violent crime?\"\n\nRobinson was detained at the Channel Tunnel in Folkestone under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, which allows police to stop, examine and search passengers at ports, airports and international rail terminals.\n\nHe was arrested for the \"frustration of a schedule 7 examination\" and released on bail while enquiries continue.\n\nIt comes after Robinson was accused of breaching a court order barring him from repeating allegations he made against Jamal Hijazi.\n\nThe Syrian refugee has brought a High Court case against Robinson over comments he made in 2018, when Mr Hijazi was 17, which included false allegations he had attacked girls in his school.\n\nMusk calls UK riots response 'insane' and 'one-sided'\n\nOn 1 August, Robinson, posted about the press conference held that day by Sir Keir regarding the riots in which the Prime Minister called those involved \"thugs\" and announced that he was giving police more powers to tackle the unrest.\n\nMr Musk responded directly to the post with two exclamation marks and did the same for another clip from the conference by a different X user as well as several videos showing people being arrested following protests.\n\nResponding to a third video about the press conference, he called the Prime Minister's comments \"insane\", and replied to two posts sent on 5 August by saying that the policing of the unrest had been \"one-sided\".\n\nThe phrases \"two-tier policing\" or \"one-sided policing\" are used by people who claim that some protests are treated more harshly by officers than others.\n\nIn the case of the recent riots, some commentators have been comparing the recent response to those seen against the Black Lives Matter movement and climate protesters.\n\nOn 4 August, X user Ashley St Clair reposted a video from the riots showing people throwing fireworks at police with the message: \"The effects of mass migration and open borders is what's going on.\"\n\nIn response to her post, Mr Musk wrote that \"civil war is inevitable\" - a comment that attracted strong criticism from Downing Street.\n\nAsked about the X owner's words, the Prime Minister's spokesperson said: \"There's no justification for comments like that. What we've seen in this country is organised, violent thuggery that has no place, either on our streets or online.\"\n\n\"We're talking about a minority of thugs that do not speak for Britain, and in response to it, we've seen some of the best of our communities coming out and cleaning up the mess [and] the disruption of those that don't speak for our country, and we've seen the response for people that do speak for our country. I think you can tell from that that the Prime Minister does not share those sentiments.\"\n\nMusk directly criticises Starmer's riot comments\n\nIn a clip issued from Sir Keir's X account on Monday evening, the Prime Minister said that the UK would not \"tolerate attacks on mosques or on our Muslim communities\".\n\nMr Musk responded directly with the message: \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on all communities?\"\n\nThe post attracted anger from many UK politicians, with former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron calling Mr Musk an \"utter berk\".\n\n\"I'm white and a Christian. No one is chucking bricks at my church or telling me to go back to where I come from. I'm concerned about attacks on the communities that are actually being attacked,\" he said.\n\nLabour MP Naz Shah, who is vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims, also replied to the post, writing: \"Luckily not all communities are being targeted. Unfortunately Muslims and mosques are.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eleanor_langford@inews.co.uk", "name": "Eleanor Langford",

He sparked further ire on Monday with a provocative reply to a tweet by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\n\"Use of language such as a 'civil war' is in no way acceptable,\" said justice minister Heidi Alexander, branding Musk's comments \"deeply irresponsible\".\n\n\"We are seeing police officers being seriously injured, buildings set alight, and so I really do think that everyone who has a platform should be exercising their power responsibly,\" she told Times Radio.\n\nRiots by anti-immigrant demonstrators have spread across England following the murder of three children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in Southport, northwest England, on Monday last week.\n\nThey have been fuelled by online disinformation that the stabbing suspect was a Muslim asylum seeker. He is 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, who was born in Britain.\n\nThe rioters have targeted mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers, forcing the government to provide emergency security to Islamic places of worship.\n\nIn a post on X on Monday, Starmer vowed to apply \"criminal law online as well as offline\", adding that \"we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or on Muslim communities\".\n\nMusk replied: \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\"\n\n- 'No justification' -\n\nHis original \"civil war\" post came in a reply to another X user blaming the riots on \"the effects of mass migration and open borders\".\n\nStarmer's spokesperson said Monday their was \"no justification\" for the comment.\n\nInfluencer Andrew Tate and far-right, anti-Islam figurehead Tommy Robinson are among people promoting false claims about Rudakubana on X.\n\nStarmer's spokesperson also blamed \"bot activity online\", suggesting that the false rumours could have been \"amplified with the involvement of state actors\".\n\nEuropeInvasion, an anti-immigrant X account with hundreds of thousands of followers, still has a post up falsely claiming that the attacker was \"confirmed to be Muslim\".\n\nAn AI-generated image depicting Muslim men chasing a child wearing a British flag has over 900,000 views.\n\nTechnology minister Peter Kyle met representatives from TikTok, Meta, Google, and X on Monday and warned that social media users spreading misinformation will have \"nowhere to hide\".\n\nMusk -- who has reduced content moderation on the platform since taking over Twitter, instead relying on user-written \"community notes\" -- regularly voices support for right-wing causes and politicians like Donald Trump in the US and Javier Milei in Argentina.\n\n6,000 police at the ready to quell riots\n\nThe UK government said on Tuesday that 6,000 specialist police officers were ready to deal with far-right rioting that broke out following the murder of three children, triggering a week of violence.\n\nOn Monday, six people were arrested and several police officers injured when they were attacked by rioters hurling bricks and fireworks in Plymouth, southern England.\n\nOfficers in Belfast, Northern Ireland, were attacked as rioters attempted to set fire to a shop owned by a foreign national.\n\nPolice said a man in his 30s was seriously assaulted during the disorder and that they are treating the incident as a racially motivated hate crime.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of men who gathered in Birmingham, central England, to counter a rumoured far-right demonstration, forced a Sky News reporter off air shouting: \"Free Palestine\". She was then followed by a man in a balaclava holding a knife.\n\nAnother reporter said he was chased by members of the group \"with what looked like a weapon\", while police said there had also been incidents of criminal damage to a pub and a car.\n\nThe unrest broke out last Tuesday after three children were killed in a stabbing spree at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, northwest England.\n\nRiots have since flared up in several cities and towns, leading to hundreds of arrests.\n\nJustice minister Heidi Alexander told BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday that the government had freed up an extra 500 prison places and drafted in 6,000 specialist police officers to deal with the ongoing violence.\n\n\"We will make sure that anyone who is given a custodial sentence as a result of the riots and disorder, there will be a prison place waiting for them,\" she said.\n\n- False rumours -\n\nMobs threw bricks and flares, attacked police, burnt and looted shops, smashed the windows of cars and homes and targeted at least two hotels housing asylum seekers in a number of cities at the weekend.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday convened and emergency meeting of ministers and police chiefs to discuss the unrest.\n\nThe government will \"ramp up criminal justice\" to ensure that \"sanctions are swift\", Starmer told the media after Monday's meeting.\n\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said 378 people had so far been arrested and that others would be \"brought to justice\".\n\nClashes broke out in Southport on Wednesday, the day after three young girls were killed and five more children critically injured during the knife attack there.\n\nFalse rumours initially spread on social media saying the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker.\n\nThe suspect was later identified as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, born in Wales. UK media reported that his parents are from Rwanda, which has very few Muslims.\n\nThat has not stopped mosques from being targeted by rioters.\n\nThe government has offered new emergency security to Islamic places of worship.\n\nIn Burnley, northwest England, a hate crime investigation was underway after gravestones in a Muslim section of a cemetery were vandalised with grey paint.\n\n\"What type of evil individual(s) would undertake such outrageous actions, in a sacrosanct place of reflection, where loved ones are buried, solely intended to provoke racial tensions?\", local councillor Afrasiab Anwar said.\n\nThe prime minister warned rioters on Sunday that they would \"regret\" participating in England's worst disorder in 13 years.\n\nInterior minister Yvette Cooper told the BBC on Monday that \"there will be a reckoning\".\n\nCooper also said that social media put a \"rocket booster\" under the violence.\n\nStarmer stressed that \"criminal law applies online as well as offline\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Alexander criticised Elon Musk, owner of X, after he claimed \"civil war\" in the UK was \"inevitable\".\n\n\"I think it is deeply irresponsible. I think everyone should be appealing for calm,\" she said.\n\nPolice have blamed the violence on people associated with the now-defunct English Defence League, a far-right Islamophobic organisation founded 15 years ago, whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.\n\nThe rallies have been advertised on far-right social media channels under the banner \"Enough is enough\".",

In response to a video showing protesters launching fireworks at police officers. Musk said that \"civil war is inevitable\" in the UK. The video shows violent clashes between rioters and law enforcement. It was shared by political commentator Ashley St Clair, who attributed the unrest to \"the effects of mass migration and open borders.\"\n\nMusk has expressed his views at least twice since the violence broke out in the UK following the deaths of three girls by stabbing in Southport, northwest England, on July 29. The violence in the UK spread across several parts, fueled by misinformation that a radical Islamist migrant was behind the mass stabbing incident involving three girls. However, the police stated that the suspect was from Britain and media reports stated that his family was Christian.\n\nALSO READ: NCERT Prioritising Various Facets Of Constitution: Pradhan Dismisses 'Preamble Removal' Claim, Slams Congress\n\nResponding to Musk's remarks, a spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, \"There's no justification for comments like that.\" \"What we've seen in this country is organized thuggery, which has no place on our streets or online. As the Home Secretary said, we're dealing with a minority of thugs (British people) who do not represent Britain. In response, we've witnessed the best of our communities coming together to clean up the mess and disruption caused by those who do not speak for our country,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Musk also commented on PM Starmer's X post in which he criticised the violence against Muslims. The UK wrote on the microblogging site that the unrest \"is not protest, it is pure violence\", adding: \"We will not tolerate attacks on mosques or on Muslim communities\". In response, Musk said, \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\"\n\nThe violence in the UK broke out following the deaths of three girls identified as Elsie Dot Stancombe,7, Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, and Bebe King, 6, by stabbing in Southport, northwest England.

I think you can tell from that that the prime minister does not share those sentiments.\"\n\nStarmer warned after a Cobra meeting with senior cabinet ministers, police chiefs and Ministry of Justice officials that the police would pursue those organising online incitement.\n\n\"If you're inciting violence, it doesn't matter whether it's online or offline,\" he said. \"And therefore I expect, just as in relation to those that are directly participating on the streets, for there to be arrests and charging and prosecution.\n\n\"Equally, anyone who has been found to have committed a criminal offence online can expect the same response.\"\n\nNo 10 said work was taking place to impress upon social media companies that they already had a duty to remove criminal content. \"The government is working with social media platforms to ensure that they are removing content quickly [and] that their processes are in place, but there is more that they can and should be doing,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"They have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their users and online spaces, to ensure that criminal activity is not being hosted on their platforms. They shouldn't be waiting for the Online Safety Act for that. They already have responsibilities in place under the law ... They have responsibilities that we will hold them to account for.\"\n\nThe technology secretary, Peter Kyle, is expected to meet social media bosses in the coming days, the spokesperson said.\n\n\"We have seen some action over the last few days by social media companies to ensure that their automated processes are working, that there is rapid response to misleading criminal content online and that that is being suppressed or removed, but as I said, this doesn't go far enough and this is subject to the conversations that the DSIT [Department for Science, Innovation and Technology] secretary continues to have.\"\n\nMusk was responding to a video posted on X by the Libs of TikTok account, originally posted by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson, who has been spreading videos of rioting that has targeted mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers.\n\nRobinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was banned from X in 2018, when it was known as Twitter, but his account was restored by Musk last year under his new ownership. Musk has since interacted with Robinson on the platform, posting exclamation marks under at least one of his posts about the violence.\n\nMusk has amplified a number of accounts posting inflammatory content about the violence, by commenting or posting exclamation marks under the users' posts.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the Cobra meeting, Starmer said a \"standing army\" of specialist public duty officers was being introduced to ensure police could deal with the disorder where needed.\n\nThe government has said there are enough prison places to deal with those going through the court system after hundreds of arrests, despite warnings a fortnight ago that prisons capacity was nearing its limit. An extra 70 prosecutors were on duty over the weekend to charge criminals, and more than 60 remand courts were held across 50 locations on Saturday.\n\nStarmer said the blame for squeezed capacity in prisons lay with the previous government and that he was \"appalled\" it was even a consideration, but added: \"We will make this work and ensure that we have got the places that are needed to bring the perpetrators swiftly to justice.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_elgot@theguardian.com", "name": "Jessica Elgot", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson_(activist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Robinson (activist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kyle_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Kyle (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libs_of_TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Libs of TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Science,_Innovation_and_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Department for Science, Innovation and Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standing army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f361bccae4c1b376b967bec93d524ab44bad2d25/0_182_6480_3888/master/6480.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=4b77b6e08cde9009014e47f33df9de9b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791913", "eventUri": "eng-9791913", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Later that evening, other Muslims visited the pub to apologise to the staff.\n\n\"I love you all, every one of you,\" a man who was in the pub during the attack said to the Muslims after telling them they didn't need to apologise for the actions of others.\n\nElsewhere, police fear more disorder, with far-right organisers reportedly planning to launch attacks on scores of immigration centres and legal firms on Wednesday night.\n\nThe spate of Islamophobic and racist riots began early last week, initially triggered by online misinformation following a stabbing attack that killed three children in Southport on Monday.\n\nFalse claims spread rapidly, including on Musk-owned X, that the attacker was a Muslim \"illegal immigrant\".\n\nHigh-profile X users, including fugitive far-right activist Tommy Robinson, former GB News presenter Laurence Fox and influencer Andrew Tate, were involved in spreading fake news to millions of people.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigel Farage, the recently elected MP for Clacton and leader of Reform UK, posted a video on Tuesday suggesting the \"truth is being withheld\" from the public about the killings.\n\nFarage, who was later dubbed \"Tommy Robinson in a suit\" by the husband of an MP killed by a far-right attacker in 2016, has since defended his remarks and doubled down on them.", "source": {"uri": "middleeasteye.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Middle

mostly replying to other users and thereby massively increasing their reach.\n\nMr Musk used his X social media site, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday to reply to a post that blamed 'mass migration and open borders' for unrest in the UK\n\nAfter a prominent account posted a video of rioters setting off fireworks at police and a Right-wing commentator blamed mass migration, Mr Musk replied: 'Civil war is inevitable.'\n\nAsked about the remark, Sir Keir's spokesman said: 'There's no justification for comments like that.\n\n'And what we've seen is organised violent thuggery that has no place on our streets or online.'\n\nYesterday Sir Keir posted a video condemning the violence and warning that criminal justice will be 'ramped up'.\n\nHe added: 'We will not tolerate attacks on mosques or on Muslim communities.'\n\nIn response, Mr Musk wrote, in a comment that received 70,000 likes and 12,000 reposts in three hours: 'Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on communities?'\n\nThe X owner also agreed that UK police 'seem one-sided' in response to a cartoon accusing officers of going soft on violent Islamists.\n\nAnd he added: 'If incompatible cultures are brought together without assimilation, conflict is inevitable.'\n\nExpert on online disinformation Dr Marc Owen Jones said: 'Musk is definitely fanning the flames... he is clearly contributing to the problem.'\n\nX did not respond to requests to comment.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In a comment on his social media site about the violence, Musk said \"civil war is inevitable\" -- a remark explicitly rejected by the Prime Minister's official spokesman, who said there was \"no justification\" for it.\n\nMusk then replied to a post on X by Sir Keir, questioning the Prime Minister's decision to provide extra protection for mosques. The spat risks complicating the Government's efforts to get social media companies, including X, to be more proactive in removing disinformation believed to be stoking the riots.\n\nSir Keir chaired an emergency COBRA committee on the riots, where he stated that anyone whipping up violence online will face \"the full force of the law.\"\n\n\"If you're inciting violence, it doesn't matter whether it's online or offline,\" the Prime Minister said. \"And therefore I expect, just as in relation to those that are directly participating on the streets, for there to be arrests, charging, and prosecution. Equally, anyone who has been found to have committed a criminal offence online can expect the same response.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said that social media platforms had \"put rocket boosters\" under false contents and added that the government would pursue the issue with tech companies.\n\n\"Social media companies also need to take some responsibility for this,\" Cooper told BBC Radio 5 Live on Monday, while noting that the police would be pursuing \"online criminality\" too.\n\n\"Social media has put rocket boosters\" under some of the misinformation and \"encouragement\" of violence, she said, adding that the government will pursue the issue with tech giants.\n\nDowning Street said that action taken by social media companies to tackle misleading and inflammatory material \"doesn't go far enough.\" It also warned that some foreign state actors were amplifying online disinformation.\n\nScience Secretary Peter Kyle met with executives from X, YouTube, Meta, Google, and TikTok about the \"spread of hateful misinformation and incitement\" regarding the riots. After holding talks with tech giants, Mr. Kyle said, \"There is a significant amount of content circulating that platforms need to be dealing with at pace. Different companies take different approaches, and I expect platforms to ensure that those seeking to spread hate online are not being facilitated and have nowhere to hide.\"\n\nThe riots began in Southport following the arrest of Axel Rudakubana, 17, who is charged with the murder of three young girls and 10 counts of attempted murder. Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, and Bebe King, six, all died in a knife attack in the Merseyside town last Monday.\n\nMisinformation online claimed the person arrested was a Muslim refugee who arrived in the UK last year via a small boat. In reality, Rudakubana was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents before moving to a village near Southport.\n\nAndrew Tate, the controversial influencer, amplified the false narrative, claiming that the attacker was an \"illegal migrant.\" Separately, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage questioned if the police, who had said the attack was not \"terror-related,\" were being truthful. Tommy Robinson of the English Defence League accused Muslims of the attack and urged his followers to protest.\n\nTravel Alerts\n\nMalaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria, and the United Arab Emirates -- all of which have majority Muslim populations -- as well as Australia, issued travel alerts advising their citizens to be cautious if traveling to the UK amid the riots.\n\nHowever, Downing Street rebuffed calls for the Army to be deployed or Parliament to be recalled in response to the clashes, which were seen in at least 16 British towns and cities in the last week.\n\nSir Keir was also forced to respond to claims of \"two-tier policing\" in Britain after Nigel Farage suggested riots over the last week had been dealt with more harshly than other recent unrest and protests. The Prime Minister rejected the claims, and Sir Mark Rowley, the Met Police Commissioner, denied that he had intentionally knocked a microphone out of a reporter's hand when asked about the issue.",

The video was posted by a user that suggested the root cause was mass immigration to the UK and open-border policies.\n\nDowning Street hit back against the statement. \"There is no justification for comments like that,\" Starmer's spokesperson told reporters, calling the riots \"organized, illegal thuggery which has no place on our streets or online.\"\n\nThe prime minister slammed the actions of troublemakers, and pledged to field a \"standing army of public duty officers\" in response.\n\n\"The criminal law applies online as well as offline, and I'm assured that is the approach that is being taken,\" Starmer said in a statement released on X. \"Whatever the apparent motivation, this is not protest. It is pure violence, and we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or our Muslim communities,\" he stressed.\n\nThe riots have seen mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers attacked.\n\n\"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\" Musk replied.\n\nThe comment referred to violent counterprotests in the UK. Police in Bolton clashed with 300 \"mostly Asian\" demonstrators after two rival groups met and a brawl broke out, the Manchester Evening News reported on Monday.\n\nIn a video circulating online, customers of a Birmingham pub can be seen being physically attacked. 'The Clumsy Swan' pub was stormed by \"a group of Muslim youths, who broke away from the main demonstration and were wearing masks and carrying weapons,\" the BBC wrote on Sunday.\n\nThe UK's top police official has been pressed on double standards over the riots, which have allegedly been dealt with more harshly than other recent unrest.\n\nReacting to a question about ending \"two-tier policing,\" Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley ripped a Sky News reporter's microphone out of his hands and walked away. He took no questions from journalists.\n\nThe events were sparked by a mass stabbing at a dance studio in Merseyside on on 29 July. Three children were killed and 10 other people injured.\n\nAxel Muganwa Rudakubana, a 17-year-old British boy born to Rwandan parents, has been charged with the stabbings.\n\nA Liverpool judge ruled on Thursday that the name of the suspect, whose identity was initially concealed due to laws protecting minors, must be released to the public as he turned 18 that week.\n\nDespite the rapid spread of rumours that the suspect was a Muslim immigrant, the police have stated he appears to have no links to Islam.", "source": {"uri": "unitedkingdomnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "United Kingdom

In response, Mr Musk wrote: 'Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?'\n\nMusk had earlier replied to a tweet by right-wing commentator Ashley St Clair, who said far-right rioting was down to 'the effects of mass migration', by suggesting 'civil war is inevitable'\n\nThe clash came as Cabinet ministers blamed social media for allowing hate and fake news to be spread, leading to violent protests by the far-Right that have seen migrant hotels and mosques attacked in the wake of the Southport stabbings a week ago.\n\nLast night hundreds of far-Right activists and anti-racist protesters came face-to-face in Plymouth, where beer bottles, flares and a crutch were flung through the air, leaving police officers injured.\n\nAnd in Birmingham a Sky News van was attacked by a knife-wielding man after members of the Muslim community gathered amid claims far-Right groups would target the Small Heath area.\n\nPolice have also been warned of alleged plans by far-Right groups to hit dozens of immigration targets across Britain on Wednesday night.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper yesterday claimed social media has put 'rocket boosters' under such groups.\n\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting warned that the spread of disinformation online is 'an existential threat to democracy'.\n\nHe told the Edinburgh Fringe festival: 'We've got to wake up, not just as Britain but as democracies collectively, to what is actually a threat to our democracy, to our national security, to trust in politics, which is already kind of rock bottom anyway.'\n\nAnd Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said: 'Responsibility for harmful social media content principally rests with the individuals and groups who create it.\n\n'But it is undeniable that social media has provided a platform for this hate.'\n\nThe clash came as Cabinet ministers blamed social media for allowing hate and fake news to be spread, leading to violent protests by the far-Right that have seen migrant hotels and mosques attacked in the wake of the Southport stabbings a week ago. Pictured: Far-right protesters in Plymouth on Monday night\n\nPolice were out in force and detained far-right protesters in Plymouth on Monday night\n\nMinisters have said X has helped stoke online hate and refused to delete racist comments while allowing controversial activists such as Tommy Robinson and Andrew Tate back on the platform.

spread of hateful misinformation and incitement'.\n\nNo 10 said action taken by the firms so far has not gone far enough.\n\n'There is more that they can and should be doing,' Sir Keir's spokesman said.\n\nHUDDERSFIELD: Shops in Huddersfield closed early as claims of a planned protest in the town spread on social media\n\nPLYMOUTH: A man is handcuffed and led away by a police

Bordesley Green, Birmingham amid rumours of a far-right gathering\n\nAfter the first emergency Cobra meeting about the riots, Downing Street also put online agitators on notice that they will be brought to justice alongside the rioters themselves.\n\n'Anyone who is guilty of criminal behaviour online, anyone who is whipping up violence online, will face the full force of law.'\n\nThe landmark Online Safety Act passed by the previous government will mean tech giants face multi-million pound fines if they fail to protect users from illegal content such as messages provoking hatred, disorder or violence.\n\nBut the duties on the firms will not come into force for several months, as regulator Ofcom is still consulting on its codes of practice and guidance.\n\nHowever, the watchdog said platforms can act now rather than waiting for the law to come into force.\n\nX has been accused of refusing to delete racist comments while allowing controversial activists such as Tommy Robinson and Andrew Tate back on the platform.\n\nThe false claim that a Muslim asylum seeker was the suspect in the Southport stabbings was first made on X by a British woman before going viral when it was spread by Russia-linked fake news website Channel3 Now.\n\nAnd, as the Mail revealed, English Defence League founder Mr Robinson was stoking the race riots with a series of video rants on X while he was on holiday in Cyprus.\n\nBut Mr Musk himself has made at least ten comments about the riots - mostly replying to other users and thereby massively increasing their reach.\n\nMr Musk used his X social media site, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday to reply to a post that blamed 'mass migration and open borders' for unrest in the UK\n\nAfter a prominent account posted a video of rioters setting off fireworks at police and a Right-wing commentator blamed mass migration, Mr Musk replied: 'Civil war is inevitable.'\n\nAsked about the remark, Sir Keir's spokesman said: 'There's no justification for comments like that.\n\n'And what we've seen is organised violent thuggery that has no place on our streets or online.'\n\nYesterday Sir Keir posted a video condemning the violence and warning that criminal justice will be 'ramped up'.\n\nHe added: 'We will not tolerate attacks on mosques or on Muslim communities.'\n\nIn response, Mr Musk wrote, in a comment that received 70,000 likes and 12,000 reposts in three hours: 'Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on communities?'\n\nThe X owner also agreed that UK police 'seem one-sided' in response to a cartoon accusing officers of going soft on violent Islamists.\n\nAnd he added: 'If incompatible cultures are brought together without assimilation, conflict is inevitable.'\n\nExpert on online disinformation Dr Marc Owen Jones said: 'Musk is definitely fanning the flames... he is clearly contributing to the problem.'\n\nX did not respond to requests to comment.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Could the billionaire be one of those people?\n\nIt's not going to happen, according to a legal expert contacted by Newsweek, who instead said he was \"shocked\" that newly elected British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the left-wing Labour Party, would make such a threat.\n\nIn the U.K., the febrile situation has raised concerns about misinformation on social media, but also concerns, including among some far-right activists, about social cohesion in multicultural societies.\n\nMusk, the Tesla CEO and owner of X (formerly Twitter), posted his comment on the same social media platform under a video showing rioters setting off fireworks at police. Musk has claimed there will be a civil war in Europe multiple times previously.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to a representative for Musk via email for comment.\n\n\"There is no justification for comments like that,\" Starmer's spokesman said on Monday.\n\n\"Anyone who is whipping up violence online will face the full force of the law,\" he added.\n\nNewsweek spoke with Yair Cohen, a U.K.-based lawyer who is an expert on internet law. When asked if Elon Musk could face any legal consequences with regard to his post on X, he said \"absolutely not.\"\n\n\"The U.K. law cannot apply to Elon Musk in America. [He] is outside the jurisdiction [and] is protected by his own law,\" he said.\n\nHe added that \"the English courts can do absolutely nothing, and they will have no right to, no legal right to even approach him or talk to you about it, or prosecute him.\"\n\nCohen also said that \"the idea that Keir Starmer is going to stop people making those type of observations which are clearly valid, is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous. I'm actually shocked by the comments that he made.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to a representative for Starmer via email for comment.\n\nThe recent riots in the U.K. came after a mass stabbing in Southport in the northwest of England. Three young girls, Elsie Dot Stancombe, Alice Dasilva Aguiar and Bebe King, died at a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop. Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, who is 17 years old, has been charged with three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article, according to police.\n\nThe spread of misinformation has raised fears that it may have contributed to the violence, with posts containing inaccurate claims gaining millions of impressions.\n\nRudakubana was born in Cardiff, a city in Wales in the west of Britain, to Rwandan parents who had migrated to the U.K. in 2002. Some posts had inaccurately said that he was an illegal immigrant.\n\nOn the weekend, disturbances were reported in northern towns and cities including Rotherham, Middlesbrough, and Bolton, all of which have significant Muslim populations. There have been attacks on Muslim communities and mosques. Some commentators, such as Reform Party leader Nigel Farage, an ally of former President Donald Trump, have linked the violence to broader concerns about immigration and social cohesion.\n\nHowever, Starmer previously said, \"Let's be very clear about this. It's not protest. It's not legitimate. It's crime and violent disorder. An assault on the rule of the law and the execution of justice.\"\n\nDuring an emergency meeting, Starmer highlighted that the law applies equally online and offline. He said, \"If you're inciting violence, it doesn't matter whether it's online or offline.\" He expects that those who incite violence online will face arrest and prosecution, similar to those involved in physical riots.\n\nThe prime minister's spokesman reinforced this stance, saying that the government is working with social media platforms to ensure harmful content is removed.\n\nThe U.K. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle added in a statement on X that while platforms must act, the primary responsibility lies with the individuals and groups creating harmful content.\n\nIn response to the riots, the government has also announced the deployment of additional officers to address the unrest and restore order.\n\nFarage has called for the U.K. Parliament to be recalled and described the riots as \"appalling.\" \"Ever since the soft policing of the Black Lives Matter protests, the impression of two-tier policing has become widespread,\" he said in statement on X.\n\n\"The Prime Minister's faltering attempts to address the current crisis have only added to that sense of injustice. The majority of our population can see the fracturing of our communities as a result of mass, uncontrolled immigration, whether legal or illegal.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType":

the killing of three children in a stabbing incident at a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga class in Southport last week.\n\n\"What we've seen in this country is organized violent thuggery that has no place either on our streets, or online,\" the spokesperson added in a statement to The Hill, echoing the prime minister's Sunday statement to the nation.\n\n\"We're talking about a minority of thugs that do not speak for Britain,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nStarmer convened an emergency response meeting Monday after violence across multiple cities that he blamed on far-right activists and misinformation on social media.\n\nMusk however critcized Starmer Monday over his statement on ensuring the safety of Muslim communities and mosques in the U.K.\n\nThe X CEO replied to Starmer's tweet asking, \"shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\"\n\nU.K. Home Minister Yvette Cooper told Parliament last week that false information had already spread online about the attacker's identity and warned \"those who do this for their own purposes risk undermining a crucial criminal investigation.\"\n\nShe added that misinformation on social media fanned the flames

He also engaged with posts by Tommy Robinson, the far-Right activist.\n\nThe entrepreneur's remark was explicitly rejected by Sir Keir Starmer's official spokesman on Monday, with Downing Street saying there was \"no justification\" for it.\n\nAsked about Mr Musk's intervention, Ms Alexander, a frontbencher at the Ministry of Justice, told Times Radio: \"These comments are unjustifiable. If you've got a ... large social media platform, then you've also got a responsibility.\n\n\"I think it is deeply irresponsible. I think everyone should be appealing for calm. Use of language such as 'civil war' is in no way acceptable.\n\n\"We're seeing police officers being seriously injured, buildings set alight, and so I really do think that everyone who has a platform should be exercising their power.\"\n\nMs Alexander doubled-down on her criticisms of Mr Musk's comments in a separate interview with LBC Radio.\n\nShe said: \"For someone who has a big platform, a large following, to be exercising that power in such an irresponsible way, I think is actually pretty unconscionable.\"\n\nOn Monday night, Mr Musk replied directly to a post by Sir Keir, questioning his decision to provide extra protection for mosques after attacks on places of Islamic worship last week.\n\nThe row could complicate efforts by the Government to get social media giants, including X, to take a more proactive approach in removing disinformation believed to be fuelling unrest.\n\nArchbishop criticises Musk\n\nMr Musk was also condemned by Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who poured scorn on his claims of eventual \"civil war\".\n\nThe Archbishop told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We had an election [at] the beginning of July, scarcely a month ago.\n\n\"And we turned to a different government, the government got turned out, and between the closing of the polls and a new prime minister peacefully in place was 14 hours, and some gracious words from the outgoing prime minister.\n\n\"That is about as far from talking about civil war as it is possible to get.\"\n\nAsked for his message to the rioters, the Archbishop replied: \"This is not the United Kingdom, it's not British, it's not English. They defile the flag they wrap themselves in.\n\n\"Protest is good and is right and is fundamental to all our freedoms, but peaceful protest will have a thousand, ten thousand, times the impact that this violence is having.\n\n\"This violence turns people away from your cause, whatever you're protesting about, and it is just criminal violence.\"\n\n'Starmer has got it wrong'\n\nMichelle Donelan, the former Tory MP who was the science secretary when the Online Safety Act came into law, said Sir Keir should not have attacked Mr Musk directly.\n\nShe told GB News Sir Keir should focus on efforts to reduce social media harms, saying: \"I think what Keir Starmer has ... got it wrong by just lurching and attacking Elon Musk.\n\n\"Actually, there are people out there on X and other platforms that are inciting violence and encouraging this to take place, and they're the people that need to be stopped.\"\n\nShe went on to accuse Sir Keir of being \"more interested in grandstanding\" than trying to deal with the issue \"at the root\".\n\nAsked whether Mr Musk's comments made the job of policing any easier, Sir Paul Stephenson, the former Met Police commissioner, described the Tesla and SpaceX founder's remarks as \"ill-informed\" and encouraged him not to \"try to create further problems\".\n\nSir Paul told LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast: \"It doesn't make it any easier, does it?

Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, a 17-year-old British boy born to Rwandan parents has been charged with stabbing three little girls to death and injuring eight other children and two adults in an attack on a Southport dance class last week. A Liverpool judge ruled on Thursday that Rudakubana's name, whose identity was initially concealed due to laws protecting minors, be released to the public as he turns 18 this week. Despite the rapid spread of rumours that the suspect was a Muslim immigrant, the police have stated he appears to have no known links to Islam.\n\nMusk had claimed that \"civil war was inevitable,\" commenting a video on X (formerly Twitter) that showed the unrest. The video was posted by a user that suggested the root cause was mass migration to the UK and open-border policies.\n\nDowning Street has hit back against the statement. \"There is no justification for comments like that,\" Starmer's spokesperson told reporters, calling the unrest \"organized, illegal thuggery which has no place on our streets or online.\"\n\nThe UK Prime Minister slammed the unrest as \"pure violence,\" promising to field a \"standing army of public duty officers,\" in response. \"The criminal law applies online as well as offline, and I'm assured that is the approach that is being taken,\" Starmer said in a statement released on X. \"Whatever the apparent motivation, this is not protest. It is pure violence, and we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or our Muslim communities,\" he stressed.\n\nThe riots have seen mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers attacked.\n\n\"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\" Musk replied.\n\nThe comment came as reports of counter-protester violence surfaced in the UK media. Police in Bolton clashed with 300 \"mostly Asian\" counter-demonstrators after two protests met and turned ugly, the Manchester Evening News reported on Monday. In a video circulating online, customers of a Birmingham pub could be seen violently assaulted. The Yardley pub, 'The Clumsy Swan' was attacked by \"a group of Muslim youths, who broke away from the main demonstration and were wearing masks and carrying weapons,\" the BBC wrote on Sunday.\n\nThe UK's top police official was pressed on double standards over the riots, which have allegedly been dealt with more harshly than other recent unrest and protests shaking the country. To a question about ending \"two-tier policing,\" Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley ripped the Sky News reporter's microphone out of his hands and walked away. He took no questions from journalists.", "source": {"uri": "unitedkingdomnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "United Kingdom News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He asked: \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on all communities?\"\n\nThe comment came after Downing Street condemned remarks made by the owner of X on his own platform, when he stated that \"civil war is inevitable\".\n\nJustice minister Heidi Alexander on Tuesday told LBC Radio Mr Musk's remarks were \"totally unjustifiable\".\n\nShe said: \"We have got police officers being seriously injured on our streets. People are looting buildings.\n\n\"They're setting buildings alight, and for someone who has a big platform, a large following, to be exercising that power in such an irresponsible way, I think is actually pretty unconscionable.\"\n\nMs Alexander added: \"I think everyone at the moment should be calling for calm. We have to find a way to tackle this disorder that we're seeing on our streets and in our communities. We will have, and continue to have, a robust police response. There will be swift and effective justice, but all individuals who have a platform should be behaving responsibly.\"\n\nFormer Conservative cabinet minister Rory Stewart replied to Mr Musk on X, saying: \"Seriously? Since when have you claimed to understand British communities or British politics? Exactly how many days have you spent with these communities?\"\n\nHe added: \"Does it ever occur to you that this might perhaps be the wrong time to sound off about a subject you know nothing about?\"\n\nLib Dem MP Tim Farron said there is \"no excuse\" for Mr Musk's remarks, adding: \"I'm white and a Christian. No one is chucking bricks at my church or telling me to go back to where I come from. I'm concerned about attacks on the communities that are actually being attacked.\"\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said there is no justification for the original comment that \"civil war is inevitable\", adding: \"We're talking about a minority of thugs that do not speak for Britain.\"\n\nThe row comes amid growing claims that social media is fuelling the violent disorder seen across UK cities over the last week.\n\nIt threatens to derail government efforts to get social media companies to play a more active role in removing harmful content from their platforms.\n\nScience and technology secretary Peter Kyle met with the bosses of X, Tiktok, Meta and Google on Monday evening as part of an attempt to \"make clear their responsibility to continue to work with us to stop the spread of hateful misinformation and incitement\".", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, a 17-year-old British boy born to Rwandan parents has been charged with stabbing three little girls to death and injuring eight other children and two adults in an attack on a Southport dance class last week. A Liverpool judge ruled on Thursday that Rudakubana's name, whose identity was initially concealed due to laws protecting minors, be released to the public as he turns 18 this week. Despite the rapid spread of rumours that the suspect was a Muslim immigrant, the police have stated he appears to have no known links to Islam.\n\nMusk had claimed that \"civil war was inevitable,\" commenting a video on X (formerly Twitter) that showed the unrest. The video was posted by a user that suggested the root cause was mass migration to the UK and open-border policies.\n\nDowning Street has hit back against the statement. \"There is no justification for comments like that,\" Starmer's spokesperson told reporters, calling the unrest \"organized, illegal thuggery which has no place on our streets or online.\"\n\nThe UK Prime Minister slammed the unrest as \"pure violence,\" promising to field a \"standing army of public duty officers,\" in response. \"The criminal law applies online as well as offline, and I'm assured that is the approach that is being taken,\" Starmer said in a statement released on X. \"Whatever the apparent motivation, this is not protest. It is pure violence, and we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or our Muslim communities,\" he stressed.\n\nThe riots have seen mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers attacked.\n\n\"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\" Musk replied.\n\nThe comment came as reports of counter-protester violence surfaced in the UK media. Police in Bolton clashed with 300 \"mostly Asian\" counter-demonstrators after two protests met and turned ugly, the Manchester Evening News reported on Monday. In a video circulating online, customers of a Birmingham pub could be seen violently assaulted. The Yardley pub, 'The Clumsy Swan' was attacked by \"a group of Muslim youths, who broke away from the main demonstration and were wearing masks and carrying weapons,\" the BBC wrote on Sunday.\n\nThe UK's top police official was pressed on double standards over the riots, which have allegedly been dealt with more harshly than other recent unrest and protests shaking the country. To a question about ending \"two-tier policing,\" Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley ripped the Sky News reporter's microphone out of his hands and walked away.

An expert says his own platform is radicalizing him.", "body": "Far-right riots have erupted across the UK after fatal stabbings at a children's dance class. False information about the attacker's identity spread rapidly online, fueling the violence. Elon Musk has weighed in on the unrest, drawing condemnation from the British government.\n\nCities across Britain have seen violent clashes as far-right riots continue to be held.\n\nAnti-immigration rioters have taken to the streets following the fatal stabbings at a children's dance class on July 29.\n\nRioters, spurred on by false reports that the attacker had arrived in the country illegally, have set cars on fire, hurled bottles, and attacked a hotel in South Yorkshire used to house asylum seekers.\n\nIn an attempt to dispel the rumors and quell the escalating violence, a judge took the unusual decision to identify the person being detained in connection with the attacks as Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, a 17-year-old born in Cardiff, Wales.\n\nBut the false reports had already spread like wildfire across pockets of the internet -- including Elon Musk's X.\n\nFake news runs riot\n\nAt the center of the unrest was the name Ali Al-Shakati.\n\nSeveral X, Facebook, and TikTok accounts claimed that Al-Shakati -- who does not exist -- was a Muslim asylum seeker who had carried out the attacks at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, near Liverpool.\n\nThe Times of London reported that the fake news had originated from a verified X account using the handle @Artemisfornow, which had more than 40,000 followers. The user has since denied this, instead blaming a Facebook post from a gossip blog.\n\nWherever the false reports originated, they rose to prominence when an X account called Channel 3 Now shared the false news, and far-right voices, including Andrew Tate, jumped on the bandwagon.\n\n\"If you look at the origins of that story, X obviously plays a major role,\" Sander van der Linden, a professor at the University of Cambridge and misinformation expert, told Business Insider.\n\nSome key instigators behind the riots, including far-right activist Tommy Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon) and Tate were banned from Twitter but reinstated after Musk bought the company.\n\n\"A lot of these individuals had been deplatformed, so they wouldn't have had an opportunity to amplify,\" Van der Linden said. \"Twitter also previously had massive fact-checking and moderation resources before Musk took over and got rid of all of that.\"\n\nMusk adds fuel to the fire\n\nInstead of condemning the violence spurred on partly by his own platform, Musk appears to be squaring up for a fight.\n\nThe UK government has already condemned the world's richest person over a comment he posted claiming \"civil war is inevitable\" below a video of the far-right disorder. Downing Street said there was \"no justification\" for the comments and called on social media companies to do more about the spread of misinformation.\n\nMusk later hit back at Prime Minister Kier Starmer for commenting that attacks on mosques or Muslim communities would not be tolerated, asking: \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on all communities?\"\n\nMusk has also claimed that the UK police's response \"does seem onesided\" -- a viewpoint commonly promoted by far-right activists.\n\nOn Tuesday Musk reposted a video of a police officer making an arrest, adding: \"Arrested for making comments on Facebook! Is this Britain or the Soviet Union? Is this accurate @CommunityNotes?\"\n\nIn another post, Musk said that X \"provides a clear and immediate way to refute anything false in the replies and with @CommunityNotes. The same is not true for legacy media who lie relentlessly, but there is no way to counter their propaganda.\"\n\nVan der Linden said Musk might be being radicalized by his own platform. Social media is increasingly becoming an echo chamber, the researcher said, especially considering the number of new accounts launched following Musk's Twitter takeover.\n\nMusk's echo chamber on X is increasingly conspiratorial, Van der Linden added.\n\n\"Musk is surrounding himself with low-quality information; he's liking and engaging with it so he sees more of it. It's almost like he's not realized he's radicalizing himself on his own platform.\"\n\nRepresentatives for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri":

His platform, X (formerly Twitter), is frequently used to express his views on a variety of topics, from technology to politics and society.\n\nHowever, this influence can have significant consequences, especially when it comes to sensitive issues such as violence and misinformation.\n\nIn recent days, the United Kingdom has been the scene of violent protests following the tragic murder of three minors in a dance class in Southport. The social network X has been used to falsely spread the word that the murderer was a Middle Eastern Muslim who had entered the country illegally.\n\nAlthough the authorities quickly denied these fake news, confirming that the attacker is a British citizen originally from Wales, Islamophobic and racist far-right groups, including several hooligans, have unleashed a wave of violence in several cities, especially in Liverpool, which is close to Southport.\n\nRecently, a hotel for immigrants in Rotherham was attacked by far-right groups, further aggravating the situation.\n\nFar from showing concern about the misuse of his social network, Elon Musk commented that \"civil war is inevitable\" in response to a post by a far-right commentator that linked violence to mass immigration and open borders.\n\nAccording to the British media The IndependentThis is the sixth time in the past eight months that Musk has suggested a civil war is brewing in Europe.\n\nMusk, who frequently writes against immigration and is aligned with Donald Trump in the United States, has been harshly criticised by the UK government. A spokesman for Prime Minister Keir Starmer said:\n\n\"There is no justification for comments like this. What we have seen across the country is organised thugs who have no place on our streets or online. As the Home Secretary said, we are talking about minority groups of thugs who do not represent Britain.\"\n\nEven British conservatives have criticized Musk's statement. Tim Montgomerie, editor of the site Conservative Homecalled the comment \"extraordinarily irresponsible,\" pointing to the need for leaders to de-escalate rather than create fear.\n\nMichael Stephens, a researcher at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, also commented:\n\n\"Making electric cars and space rockets does not equate to political understanding. Civil war is by no means inevitable. The UK is a small space filled with a lot of people. We all have to make it work.\"\n\nThe situation in the UK reflects how misinformation on social media can inflame tensions and trigger violence. Comments from influential figures such as Elon Musk can have a significant impact and it is crucial that they are responsible in their statements.\n\nThe response from the British government and the Conservatives underlines the importance of sensible communication and the rejection of violence and disinformation.", "source": {"uri": "bullfrag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bullfrag"},

But No10 publicly criticised Mr Musk on Monday saying: \"There's no justification for comments like that and what we've seen in this country is organised violent thuggery that has no place on our streets or online.\"\n\nThe X owner then responded to a post by the PM which said the Government will \"not tolerate attacks on mosques or Muslim communities\". But Mr Musk said: \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\".\n\nIn recent days mosques have been targeted by far-right mobs while hotels housing asylum seekers in Rotherham and Tamworth were attacked at the weekend.\n\nThe ex-Tory Cabinet Minister Rory Stewart responded to the billionaire businessman on X saying: \"Seriously? Since when have you claimed to understand British communities or British politics? Exactly how many days have you spent with these communities? Does it ever occur to you that this might perhaps be the wrong time to sound off about a subject you know nothing about?\"\n\nNo10 has not responded to the latest comments but government ministers continued to criticise Mr Musk's \"civil war\" claims on Tuesday morning. Justice minister Heidi Alexander told LBC radio his remarks were \"totally unjustifiable\". She said: \"We have got police officers being seriously injured on our streets. People are looting buildings.\n\n\"They're setting buildings alight, and for someone who has a big platform, a large following, to be exercising that power in such an irresponsible way, I think is actually pretty unconscionable.\"\n\nMs Alexander added: \"I think everyone at the moment should be calling for calm. We have to find a way to tackle this disorder that we're seeing on our streets and in our communities. We will have, and continue to have, a robust police response. There will be swift and effective justice, but all individuals who have a platform should be behaving responsibly.\"\n\nIt comes as Keir Starmer continued to face demands to recall Parliament over the violence witnessed on the streets since last week.\n\nVeteran Labour MP Diane Abbott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme today: \"Calling Parliament back from recess has always been about major national issues and where you have violence nationwide, violence as serious as this, violence which shows no sign of abating, I call that a serious national issue.\"\n\nOn Monday the Government was forced to bring forward plans to create 500 new prison places as a result of the violent disorder. A new houseblock at HMP Stocken, in Rutland, East Mids, will receive its first prisoners from next week.\n\nCells at HMP Cookham Wood, a former young offender institution repurposed as an adult prison, will become available in the coming weeks. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"My message to anyone who chooses to take part in this violence is simple. The police, courts and prisons stand ready and you will face the consequences of these appalling acts.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_cowburn@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Ashley Cowburn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamworth,_Staffordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tamworth, Staffordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamworth, Staffordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heidi Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotherham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Prison_Stocken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HM Prison Stocken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabana_Mahmood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shabana Mahmood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diane Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_delinquency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juvenile delinquency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(BBC_Radio_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Today (BBC Radio 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rutland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rutland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33402294.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/6_AHP_CHP_27753.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791913", "eventUri": "eng-9791913", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

The far-right agitator was ebullient - and made a point of thanking Elon Musk for giving a \"voice for the truth\".\n\nSo what? Robinson, who has been accused of stoking the anti-immigration riots, owes his huge platform to Musk. The billionaire owner of X rescued Robinson from the digital wilderness by restoring his account last November. In the past few days Musk has:\n\nIt was the screening of this documentary at a demonstration in London last month that prompted Robinson's arrest under counter-terrorism powers. Robinson left the UK the day before he was due in court, and is currently believed to be staying at a five-star hotel in Ayia Napa. He is due in court for a full contempt hearing in October.\n\nNone of this has stopped Robinson incessantly tweeting about the riots, where far-right groups have regularly chanted his name. He has:\n\nMaking the weather. The far-right activist has nearly 900,000 followers on X, but reaches a much larger number of people. Tortoise calculated that Robinson's 268 posts over the weekend had been seen over 160 million times by late Monday afternoon.\n\nAnalytics published by Robinson last week showed that his posts had been viewed 1.2 billion times in the three months to August, with 4.5 million people visiting his profile. Every data point indicates that Robinson's platform on X has massively grown over the past six months.\n\nRobinson has called Musk \"the best thing to happen for free speech this century\". He's perhaps not the only person to feel this way. The far-right activist is part of a wider constellation of agitators, right-wing media commentators, online influencers and self-styled news aggregators who have used X to foment unrest in recent days.\n\n\"It's like a school of fish,\" said Joseph Mulhall, director of research at the advocacy group Hope Not Hate. \"People like Tommy Robinson are the weathermakers.\"\n\nAbsolute state. Mulhall described a decentralised \"post-organisational network\" of accounts consuming, creating and engaging with far-right content. These accounts include Musk, who has called himself a free-speech absolutist.\n\nOn Sunday Musk, who lives 5,000 miles from the streets of Middlesbrough and Rotherham, responded to a tweet that blamed what was happening in the UK on its diversity. He wrote that \"if incompatible cultures are brought together without assimilation, conflict is inevitable\". Later he replied to a video of riots in Liverpool: \"Civil war is inevitable\".\n\nA spokesperson for Starmer said there was \"no justification\" for Musk's comments, and that the \"organised violent thuggery\" happening in the UK has no place on the streets or online.\n\nThe role of X and its owner in stirring up the riots will put to test the UK's online safety bill, which is designed to hold social media companies to account.\n\n\"Elon Musk needs to be called into parliament,\" said Mulhall. \"Twitter should be facing extraordinary scrutiny, both legal and financial. Musk as an individual and the platform that he's curating is having a disastrous effect on our streets and in our communities.\"\n\nWhat's more. Yesterday afternoon Musk responded directly to a social media post from Starmer, questioning the prime minister's pledge to protect mosques. Robinson continued to post about the riots from his sunbed. Neither is behaving as if they have much to fear.\n\nThanks for reading.

Among the anti-immigrant protesters were people carrying Irish Tricolours, along with a 'Coolock Says No' banner.\n\nSecurity sources have said that there were several 'violent' protesters in Belfast who had earlier in the year demonstrated at the disused Crown Paints site in Coolock in Dublin, a building which has been set on fire several times in recent weeks.\n\nPressure is mounting on governments to clamp down on Mr Musk and his X platform, formerly known as Twitter, with violent footage and hate speech continually circulating on the platform.\n\nThe British prime minister's office said there was 'no justification' for the controversial billionaire's remarks as Keir Starmer scrambles to deal with the escalating disorder.\n\nMr Musk used his X social media site on Monday to reply to a post that blamed 'mass migration and open borders' for unrest in the UK. 'Civil war is inevitable,' the mega-wealthy investor wrote in response to another user.\n\nTwitter/X has been accused of refusing to delete racist comments while allowing controversial activists such as Tommy Robinson and Andrew Tate back on the platform over the past two years.\n\nAnd as the Mail revealed on Monday, English Defence League founder Mr Robinson was stoking the race riots with a series of video rants on Twitter/X while he was on holiday in Cyprus.\n\nBut Mr Musk himself, the world's richest man with a fortune estimated at more than $250billion, has made at least ten comments about the situation in the UK - mostly replying to other users and thereby massively increasing their reach - since Sunday.\n\nAfter a prominent account posted a video of rioters setting off fireworks at police and a right-wing commentator blamed mass migration, Mr Musk - who has 192 million followers - replied: 'Civil war is inevitable.'\n\nBut, asked about the businessman's remarks, Mr Starmer's official spokesman said: 'There's no justification for comments like that. What we've seen in this country is organised violent thuggery that has no place either on our streets or online.\n\n'As the home secretary [Yvette Cooper] said this morning, we're talking about a minority of thugs that do not speak for Britain.\n\n'And in response to it, we've seen some of the best of our communities coming out and cleaning up the mess, disruption of those that don't speak for our country. We've seen a response from people that do speak for our country. I think you can you can tell from that that the PM does not share those sentiments.'\n\nThe clash between Downing Street and Mr Musk came as the British government piled fresh pressure on social media companies, such as X, to remove criminal material and hate-filled misinformation from their sites.\n\nMr Starmer himself warned that anyone whipping up violence online will face 'the full force of the law', while Britain's Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said social media firms providing 'a platform for this hate' must go further in tackling it. The PSNI said on Monday evening they are aware of social media posts calling for protests across the North in the week ahead.\n\nGarda sources said that there is now a 'real possibility' that protests south of the border could be infiltrated by loyalist gangs and vice versa as a result of the new co-ordinated co-operation. This potential 'alliance' between loyalist gangs and far-right groups in the Republic are creating 'headaches' for garda\u00ed.\n\n'If either group wished to target a protest, then they could use each other's members to do so,' sources said.\n\n'It's a headache, resource-wise. The units on this side of the border who are looking at these people are well aware of the main ringleaders and who to watch out for, the history they have and any previous violent streak they might have.\n\n'Where if you have those from the North coming down, they're new faces, they're going to look like the Dublin lads until they open their mouths. What this will mean is that the PSNI and the garda\u00ed will have to be hands-on with the information sharing.'\n\nSolidarity-People Before Profit TD Br\u00edd Smith TD said the Irish anti-immigration rioters who crossed the border at the weekend showed their true colours.\n\n'The sight of far-right agitators from Dublin alongside loyalist paramilitaries, including at least one known sectarian murderer, demonstrates very clearly to everyone who the far right in Dublin and elsewhere are. They are determined racists, some filmed giving Nazi salutes, who work closely with the British far right, people like Tommy Robinson, as well as US white supremacist groups,' she said.\n\nLabour MEP Aodh\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in said the platform needed to be 'regulated to within an inch of its existence'. '[Musk] is a bad actor and it is a poisonous site and it's doing its best to whip tension and fear and it has to be viewed on that basis,' he said.\n\n'He is politicising the platform with hard-right views and on that basis everything should be on the table in terms of regulating that platform.' Mr \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in said he would be raising the issue in the European Parliament.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's justice spokesman Pa Daly told the Irish Daily Mail: 'There is a need for an urgent transnational response to the failure of social media companies to manage content appearing on their platforms adequately.'\n\nMr Daly said that the 'full force of the 2024 Digital Services Act' needed to be applied to social media companies failing to uphold their legal obligations and 'to check the unacceptable and inflammatory actions of those responsible'. The European Commission is the lead authority for risk assessment/mitigation obligations, including harmful impacts of mis- and disinformation when it comes to the largest social media platforms. On December 18, 2023, the commission opened formal proceedings to assess whether X may have breached the Digital Services Act in areas linked to the dissemination of illegal content and the effectiveness of the measures taken to combat information manipulation, for which the investigation continues.\n\nMs McEntee said on Monday she spoke to the North's justice minister Naomi Long and 'offered our full support following the appalling acts of violence and racism over the weekend'. She added: 'I have spoken also to the Garda Commissioner. To anyone who has travelled North or is thinking of travelling, know this: Garda\u00ed and PSNI are working closely together and they will identify those responsible.'\n\nTaoiseach Simon Harris said he spoke with the North's first minister Michelle O'Neill about the protests. The Taoiseach expressed his 'disgust at those flying the Irish Tricolour whilst attacking police and spouting racism', adding: 'This is repugnant to everything the Irish flag represents.'", "source":

In response to the riots, Sir Keir Starmer said the criminal law \"applies online as well as offline\". X owner Elon Musk has been quick to retaliate against the politician's comments, highlighting divisions that are spreading far beyond Southport.\n\nIt comes a week after three children were killed in an attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport. Since then false information that the suspect was a radical Islamist migrant has spread online.\n\nTweets shift from Southport to protests\n\nOver the past week data from social media monitoring tool TalkWalker shows that tweets online have shifted from Southport to protests reflecting the changing focus of right-wing groups in particular.\n\nFollowing online speculation about the suspect's identity and false claims that he is an immigrant and Muslim, we chose to focus our searches on the language used within the speculative claims.\n\nTwo days after the stabbing, tweets relating to Southport and various terms relating to Muslims and immigration began to decrease.\n\nBut there was a notable increase in tweets relating to both 'protest' and various terms relating to Muslims and immigration which spiked from Friday and over the weekend - as a number of riots took place across the UK.\n\nSky News has seen multiple messages in various Telegram groups since last Thursday promoting protests - many of these have shared posters for riots at mosques.\n\nAnti-immigrant sentiment was not only clear online but at the protests themselves. One video taken in Hull on Saturday shows protesters shouting: \"We want our country back\".\n\nMisinformation spreading online\n\nMisinformation on social media platforms raises questions for platforms like X.\n\nFormer leader of the defunct anti-Islam English Defence League, Tommy Robinson, tweeted a video taken from the riots in Hanley, Stoke, on Saturday falsely claiming that two \"British men\" had been \"stabbed by Muslims\".\n\nThirty minutes after this video was shared by Robinson, Staffordshire Police issued a statement saying that two men had been \"injured\" but \"no stabbings\" had been reported to police \"despite videos fuelling speculation on social media\".\n\nThe force said the men were injured by a \"blunt object that was thrown\".\n\nRobinson's tweet which is still on X has almost one million views and was shared thousands of times. As a high-profile far-right figure, his online involvement demonstrates how false information can be amplified on X.\n\nWhile he clarified there were no reports of stabbings six hours after his original post - the tweet has not been flagged by X and his clarification was viewed 170k times - significantly less than the false claim he first shared.\n\nX rules state that users must not \"share synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm\".\n\nSky News has asked the platform why a community note has not been added to the post to show Robinson's original claim that two men had been stabbed was not true. The platform didn't respond at the time of publication.\n\nBeyond the platform's guidelines, X owner Elon Musk reinstated Robinson's account in November 2023 after he was banned for \"hateful conduct\". Musk has repeatedly been criticised for the spread of disinformation on X since he took charge.\n\nThe billionaire has responded to a number of tweets regarding the riots. On Sunday, he tweeted a comment that read \"civil war is inevitable\", in response to a video re-posted by a conservative influencer, showing disorder during one of the protests.\n\n'No justification' for Musk comments\n\nSir Keir responded to Musk's post, with the prime minister's official spokesperson commenting: \"There is no justification for comments like that.\n\n\"Anyone who is whipping up violence online will face the full force of the law. Online platforms have a responsibility.\"\n\nSir Keir also posted a video of himself on X talking about clamping down on the riots. In the video's comments, Musk didn't hesitate to reply to the politician's statement, saying: \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\"\n\nHis post was viewed more than half a million times within an hour of posting.\n\nTelegram messages show tactics changing\n\nSky News has monitored more than six Telegram groups since the attack happened which have organised and discussed riots across the country.\n\nWhile some mosques were targeted last week, many locations of the riots included town halls and other civic buildings. However, Sky News has seen a list of 39 locations for protests set to take place this week - all of which are either immigration centres or immigration service buildings.\n\nTelegram's Terms of Service states that users must not use the platform to \"promote violence on publicly viewable Telegram channels\".\n\nSky News has asked Telegram for comment.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com",

Following this, he addressed an offensive caricature regarding alleged \"two-tier policing\", remarking that \"it does seem one-sided\".\n\nA spokesperson for the Prime Minister refuted Musk's claims, stating \"there is no justification for comments like that\". Parallel to this, the technology minister was in discussions with social media company representatives, including those from X, pressing them to take firmer action against online hate speech.\n\nUndeterred, Musk took another swipe at Starmer, counter-commenting on a video tweeted by the PM, which expressed zero tolerance for assaults on Muslims and mosques. To his extensive following of 193 million on Twitter, Musk retorted: \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\"\n\nJoin us on WhatsApp to get the latest news straight to your phone\n\nMerely 24 hours before this latest foray, Musk had caused a stir with a tweet exclaiming: \"Civil war is inevitable.\", reports the Express. Cabinet ministers are pointing fingers at social media platforms for letting unfounded gossip and malice circulate freely, contributing to the escalated far-right disturbances troubling the UK for over a week now.\n\nThe situation has grown tense as venues housing migrants along with mosques have come under siege subsequent to the dreadful Southport knifing where three young girls died and several more were injured. After misinformation about a violent incident went viral, falsely alleging that an asylum seeker was responsible for the attack, far-right hooligans swarmed the streets. In reality, the arrested suspect, 17 year old Axel Rudakubana, is a Cardiff native.\n\nTensions flared up last night as far-right and anti-racism groups clashed in Plymouth throwing beer bottles and flares, resulting in injuries to police officers. Meanwhile, in Birmingham, a Sky News van became the target of an aggressor who stabbed the vehicle's tyre with a knife and caused the news crew to hastily evacuate the scene.\n\nIn response to the nationwide riots instigated by thousands of far-right disruptors, Prime Minister Sir Keir convened an urgent Cobra meeting at No10 on Monday. He has committed to establishing a \"standing army\" of specially trained police officers to tackle what he decried as \"far-right thuggery\".\n\nThese tumultuous events present a significant challenge for him, coming just a month after he assumed office at Downing Street following a triumphant general election victory.\n\nGet the latest breaking news and top stories from Derbyshire in our

Obviously, what's going on at the moment that's being targeted on the Muslim community [is] appalling but I do think that's why you get questions.\"\n\nHost Kate Garraway briefly interrupted to make a point before Pierce continued to say it could give the \"perception of two-tier policing\".\n\nSome GMB viewers were not happy with Pierce's comments which they claimed made a comparison between the current riots and marches in support of Palestine.\n\nOne person posted on X: \"Absolutely disgraceful to attempt to draw such a comparison but of little surprise.\"\n\nAnother shared: \"He is trying to manufacture more fuel to add to the fire. British media is just trash on fire, day in, day out.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another wrote: \"MSM propaganda machines are one of the root causes of these racist attacks on minorities in the UK. Plus there's no comparison between the peaceful protests in support of Palestine to the racist riots.\"\n\nViewers also described the point as \"ill informed sensationalist lies\" and that Pierce was

Yesterday, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson stated that \"there is no excuse for comments like these.\" \"What we have seen in this country is organized thuggery that has no place on our streets or online...

During the night, according to the Daily Mail, he also criticized the British police, expressing agreement with a cartoon that implies the authorities handle illegal immigrants and locals with double standards.\n\nAt the top of the cartoon, there is a caricature of a man wearing a headband with the Pakistani flag, holding a knife and saying \"kill the infidels.\" \"We are here to protect you,\" replies a police officer next to him. At the bottom of the cartoon, another man says, \"I just don't want my children to be stabbed,\" and the police officer accuses him of being a \"Nazi.\"\n\nThe user who posted the cartoon argued in the caption that the reputation of the UK police has been tarnished, with Musk commenting that there does indeed appear to be unequal treatment.", "source": {"uri": "en.protothema.gr", "dataType": "news", "title": "protothemanews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North West England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caricature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caricature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://en.protothema.gr/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/musk-1024x517.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791913", "eventUri": "eng-9791913", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Nothing, but Absent Serious Action Prime Minister Starmer Finds a Scapegoat", "body": "As violence grips Great Britain, an untested prime minister hits out against a perennial easy target: social media.\n\nMonkey see, monkey do? Just as Democrats seek to cast Donald Trump as a bigot for calling out Kamala Harris for playing the race card, the new leftist prime minister of Great Britain, Keir Starmer, is shifting the blame for an eruption of violence over the public's exasperation with the migrant crisis on to anyone's shoulders but his own. Now in his sights is the American billionaire and high-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk.\n\nMr. Musk commented on the social media network he owns, X, that in the wake of the ongoing violent protest \"civil war is inevitable\" in Britain. He paired that remark with a video of rioters lobbing firecrackers at police officers. A representative for the prime minister then stated that there \"is no justification for comments like that\" and \"anyone who is whipping up violence online will face the full force of the law.\"\n\nWas Mr. Musk's opinion, while arguably glib, really \"whipping up\" violence in the streets of Britain? Does it mean he could now face prosecution at the Old Bailey? In any case, the Tesla tycoon is not one to be easily cowed -- after Mr. Starmer stated that \"we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or on Muslim communities\" Mr. Musk countered with \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on all communities?\"\n\nBritain has been wracked by several days of urban violence triggered by the murder of three young girls who were attending a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on July 29. The alleged perpetrator of the knife attack, a 17-year-old black teenager named as Axel Rudakubana, whose parents immigrated to Britain from Rwanda, was apprehended and is reportedly now in police custody.\n\nSocial media has played a part, albeit not the only part, in the ensuing violent protests at London, Manchester, Hartlepool, Rotherham, South Yorkshire, Middlesbrough, Sunderland, and elsewhere. Long-simmering tensions over the mounting cost to the public of asylum-seekers, many thousands of whom arrived in Britain illegally aboard small boats that set off from France, have boiled over. Much of the public feels unfairly burdened by the cost.\n\nConsiderable rage has been directed against police stationed outside hotels that are hosting asylum seekers. Some of the asylum seekers presumably come from Muslim-majority countries. A noteworthy figure from the far right has also reportedly been stirring violence; he is 41-year-old Tommy Robinson, founder of the anti-immigration English Defense League. The EDL has been inactive since 2018, but Mr. Robinson is still an influential figure.\n\nBritish police have said that the EDL was among the parties responsible for injuring more than 50 police officers in recent protests. Mr. Robinson, who has been imprisoned on four occasions, was for a time banned from X, formerly known as Twitter. However, Elon Musk in recent months again permitted him to use the platform, which he has apparently been doing while on holiday in Cyprus.\n\nIt was enough for some to carp that \"the resurgence of far right violence in the U.K. is partly due to Elon Musk's decision to allow figures such as Tommy Robinson back on to the social media platform X.\" Mr. Robinson has previously stated that \"Islam is a fascist and violent religion.\" He has stated that \"we can bring people together and enter a new era in Europe where everyone will unite against the Islamization of our countries.\"\n\nYet on X, his statements have been more restrained: \"British people are angry and betrayed by their government,\" he wrote in one post, adding that \"the media is lying to us\" and \"the safety of our children has been taken away from us.\"\n\nAccording to the Times of London, Mr. Robinson departed Britain on July 28 and is \"enjoying his holidays with his children while continuing to promote further protests this week.\"\n\nWhile the new Labor government struggles to solve the problem of migrant hotels filling up across Britain, Mr. Robinson has proffered his own solution: \"Mass deportations now,\" he's stated. In the meantime, former Brexiteer and current leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, has called for Parliament to be recalled.\n\nMr. Farage's hard-fought-for new seat in the House of Commons is still warm. So now his newfound nemesis Mr. Starmer has little choice but to lend him an ear -- which he might just do once he takes a break from beating up on Mr. Musk.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com",

Log in.\n\nIn an attempt to dispel the rumors and quell the escalating violence, a judge took the unusual decision to identify the person being detained in connection with the attacks as Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, a 17-year-old born in Cardiff, Wales.\n\nBut the false reports had already spread like wildfire across pockets of the internet -- including Elon Musk's X.\n\nAt the center of the unrest was the name Ali Al-Shakati.\n\nSeveral X, Facebook, and TikTok accounts claimed that Al-Shakati -- who does not exist -- was a Muslim asylum seeker who had carried out the attacks at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, near Liverpool.\n\nThe Times of London reported that the fake news had originated from a verified X account using the handle @Artemisfornow, which had more than 40,000 followers. The user has since denied this, instead blaming a Facebook post from a gossip blog.\n\nWherever the false reports originated, they rose to prominence when an X account called Channel 3 Now shared the false news, and far-right voices, including Andrew Tate, jumped on the bandwagon.\n\n\"If you look at the origins of that story, X obviously plays a major role,\" Sander van der Linden, a professor at the University of Cambridge and misinformation expert, told Business Insider.\n\nSome key instigators behind the riots, including far-right activist Tommy Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon) and Tate were banned from Twitter but reinstated after Musk bought the company.\n\n\"A lot of these individuals had been deplatformed, so they wouldn't have had an opportunity to amplify,\" Van der Linden said. \"Twitter also previously had massive fact-checking and moderation resources before Musk took over and got rid of all of that.\"\n\nInstead of condemning the violence spurred on partly by his own platform, Musk appears to be squaring up for a fight.\n\nThe UK government has already condemned the world's richest person over a comment he posted claiming \"civil war is inevitable\" below a video of the far-right disorder. Downing Street said there was \"no justification\" for the comments and called on social media companies to do more about the spread of misinformation.\n\nMusk later hit back at Prime Minister Kier Starmer for commenting that attacks on mosques or Muslim communities would not be tolerated, asking: \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on all communities?\"\n\nMusk has also claimed that the UK police's response \"does seem onesided\" -- a viewpoint commonly promoted by far-right activists.\n\nOn Tuesday Musk reposted a video of a police officer making an arrest, adding: \"Arrested for making comments on Facebook! Is this Britain or the Soviet Union? Is this accurate @CommunityNotes?\"\n\nIn another post, Musk said that X \"provides a clear and immediate way to refute anything false in the replies and with @CommunityNotes. The same is not true for legacy media who lie relentlessly, but there is no way to counter their propaganda.\"\n\nVan der Linden said Musk might be being radicalized by his own platform. Social media is increasingly becoming an echo chamber, the researcher said, especially considering the number of new accounts launched following Musk's Twitter takeover.\n\nMusk's echo chamber on X is increasingly conspiratorial, Van der Linden added.\n\n\"Musk is surrounding himself with low-quality information; he's liking and engaging with it so he sees more of it. It's almost like he's not realized he's radicalizing himself on his own platform.\"\n\nRepresentatives for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, made outside

Obviously, what's going on at the moment that's being targeted on the Muslim community [is] appalling but I do think that's why you get questions.\"\n\nHost Kate Garraway briefly interrupted to make a point before Pierce continued to say it could give the \"perception of two-tier policing\".\n\nSome GMB viewers were not happy with Pierce's comments which they claimed made a comparison between the current riots and marches in support of Palestine.\n\nOne person posted on X: \"Absolutely disgraceful to attempt to draw such a comparison but of little surprise.\"\n\nRecommended reading:\n\nAnother shared: \"He is trying to manufacture more fuel to add to the fire. British media is just trash on fire, day in, day out.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another wrote: \"MSM propaganda machines are one of the root causes of these racist attacks on minorities in the UK. Plus there's no comparison between the peaceful protests in support of Palestine to the racist riots.\"\n\nViewers also described the point as \"ill informed sensationalist lies\" and that Pierce was \"sounding confused\".", "source": {"uri": "malverngazette.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malvern Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMB_(trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "GMB (trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson_(activist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Robinson (activist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Garraway", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Garraway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolent resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ummah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.malverngazette.co.uk/resources/images/18389495/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791913", "eventUri": "eng-9791913", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 410, "textEnd": 417}], "sentiment": -0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Earlier, a vigil was held for the victims of a mass stabbing in Southport last week which sparked the unrest. Nearly 400 people have been arrested since the rioting began.\" - BBC\n\n>Today: ToryDiary: Tough on riots, tough on the causes of riots\n\n\"Sir Keir Starmer is locked in a war of words with Elon Musk after the billionaire claimed that Britain was facing a \"civil war\" over immigration, as far-right activists circulated plans to attack dozens of immigration centres on Wednesday. The owner of Twitter/X, the social media platform, replied to claims that mass migration was fuelling the riots by saying that \"civil war is inevitable\". Musk also highlighted a post by the far-right leader Tommy Robinson claiming that \"Muslims run through the streets unchallenged by police, attacking any non Muslim\". He responded to another post stating that the government is \"prioritising mosques over British girls in their dance classes\" with an exclamation mark.\" - The Times\n\n\"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has dismissed calls to recall Parliament to discuss the violent protests taking place across the country. Former home secretary Dame Priti Patel, Labour MP Diane Abbott and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage are among the politicians urging Sir Keir to cut short the parliamentary recess. Dame Priti, who is running to be Conservative leader, said there were \"many practical things\" MPs could do if Parliament was recalled. But Sir Keir said his focus was on stopping the disorder and making sure the streets were safe.\" - BBC\n\n\"All have condemned mob thuggery and disorder. (It would be surprising if they hadn't.) But two in particular have a tale to tell, if they want to get around to it. Jenrick and Tugendhat were both Home Office ministers when pro-Palestinian protests grew in size and scale last year. Both were unhappy with the police and security response. Both urged changes. And both see a connection between the handling of those protests then and the violence on our streets now. To cut a long story short, both believe that the prime purpose of policing is to maintain public order. And they think that the law should bear down no less heavily on those trashing banks or menacing shops in the name of Palestine than those burning cars or hurling bricks in the name of patriotism -- or Islam, for that matter. While knowing from experience that the police have to make difficult calls, both feel that claims of two-tier policing aren't entirely wide of the mark.\" - Paul Goodman, The Times\n\n\"Rachel Reeves has refused to rule out changing a measure of the UK's debt pile, in a move that could free up billions of pounds for the chancellor at her forthcoming autumn budget. Speaking on a trip to New York and Toronto, Reeves said she would set out the \"precise details\" of her fiscal rules in her maiden budget, amid speculation that the government will change its debt-to-GDP measure to exclude losses made by the Bank of England's bond-buying programme. The tweak could free up to \u00a317 billion in headroom for the government, according to calculations from City analysts.\" - The Times\n\n\"Liz Truss has warned that the Conservative Party \"could effectively die\" as she criticised Rishi Sunak's leadership. During a 90-minute Edinburgh Festival Fringe show, the former prime minister shared her dislike for her successor and faced audience members who told her to \"just apologise\" over the effects of her Government's mini-Budget. Ms Truss told the audience at the event, hosted by LBC's Matthew Stadlen, that Reform UK could replace the Tories as the party representing the Right.\" - Daily Telegraph\n\n>Today: Columnist Peter Franklin: What Conservatives should learn from America's Presidential election\n\n\"Japanese stocks surged on Tuesday, leading markets higher across Asia in a striking reversal of the previous day's global sell-off...Global markets have tumbled in recent days amid fears the Federal Reserve has been too slow to respond to signs the US economy is cooling, and that it could be forced to play catch-up with a series of rapid interest rate cuts.

{"id": 225017286, "title": "Taylor Swift fans advised to bring 'clever' \u00a314 item to Edinburgh Eras tour", "text": "Taylor Swift is officially bringing her Eras tour to the UK when she arrives at Edinburgh's Murrayfield Stadium between June 7-9. With not long to go now, many fans have been advising others on what to take ahead of the gates opening. Since it is a mammoth three-hours, fans will certainly find that they will need to keep hydrated among singing along to their favourite songs. That's why Ticketmaster, alongside many others, have recommended that fans bring a personal, collapsible water bottle, as long as it is permitted. One \"clever\" option that we have spotted is the Kemier Collapsible Water Bottle that is \u00a313.99 on Amazon. With Murrayfield's safety measures prohibiting water bottles up to 500ml, you can use this bottle's unique roll-up design to pack it flat into your handbag. Once inside, you can fill it up with water to remain hydrated throughout the massive concert. The Kemier bottle has been made from a \"lightweight\" medical grade silicone that won't be too heavy to hold. It's also \"leak proof\", thanks to a one-button switch and lock ring that prevents any unwanted spillages inside your handbag. With a 4.1 rating on Amazon, the collapsible water bottle has impressed thousands of shoppers with its \"clever\" and \"space saving\" design that makes it perfect for so many functions. One shopper wrote: \"I don't often do reviews. ......but felt I had to say what a clever bit of design this is. Great value does exactly what it's supposed to I would highly recommend and have already done so to friends and family. 16 yr. old boy is using it everyday and it stands up to being knocked about in his bag all day!\" Join the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages. A second five-star review read: \"This bottle is great as when you finish drinking from it you can collapse it so it does not take up too much room in your bag. Not leaked as yet, lightweight & very easy to clean.\" Another read: \"The bottle folds up when empty making it a space saver. When full, just hang it on the outside of your pack.\" A fourth positive review read: \"Perfect bottle, perfect size, good materials, well constructed, very light.\" However, some shoppers have found that it took a while to get rid off the \"odd taste\" of the bottle. One such review read: \"This did the trick as after something light and space saving for travel, however it takes a while to get rid of the odd taste it gives the water despite trying all the recommended methods.\" Amazon shoppers can purchase the Kemier Collapsible Water Bottle for \u00a313.99 on Amazon here. Collapsible water bottles are not just perfect for taking to concerts, but can also be used for running, travelling or hiking.

{"id": 243349626, "title": "Amazon SPF that 'reduces dark spots, wrinkles and uneven skin tone' now \u00a310", "text": "Amazon is offering a popular skincare product that's ideal for all seasons, but particularly essential during the summer months. The L'Or\u00e9al Paris Revitalift Clinical SPF, is currently available for just \u00a310 when it would normally have a retail price of \u00a319.99 - a whopping 50% off its original price. The need for having SPF as one of your steps in your skincare routine has long been emphasises by skincare experts and dermatologists but this becomes even more crucial when UV rays are as potent as they've been over the past few days. If you're wearing sun cream in nearly 30 degree heat then why wouldn't you keep your face protected as well? L'Or\u00e9al's SPF isn't the only one on the market, with many different skincare and makeup brands also selling versions but this one has gained popularity among shoppers for many reasons. Despite not being marketed as an anti-ageing cream this could go a long way in preventing signs of ageing from dark spots to uneven skin tones, all of which are results of too much UV exposure. The SPF also has 'long UVA and very high SPF50+ protection', thanks to its daily broad-spectrum filters. Regardless of its price, this product seems to resonate with shoppers of all skin types. One customer who appreciated that the product doesn't leave white marks commented: \"This product is as good or better than more expensive branded ones that I was previously using. Blends into skin and does not leave any white marks. I put it on after moisturising.\" A pleased reviewer who described it as a 'great product' said: \"Great product. This cream goes on super easily, great coverage, you really don't need a lot. Most importantly for me is that it does not go greasy throughout the day. The best moisturiser I've used.\" Another satisfied customer wrote: \"Feels great like a face lift and you can put your makeup on without disturbing it . Very good buy and came well packed.\" A third shared: \"Great sunscreen protection for my face. I use it after I moisturise but before my makeup and it absorbs well and doesn't leave any white residue nor does it make my makeup slide off by the end of day. There is a faint smell typical with sunscreens so if you want something fragrant free this isn't for you. But if you don't mind that smell and want good protection that isn't too expensive I would recommend it.\" Not all shoppers agreed with a handful of them actually claiming it cause their skin to break out. One said: \"Made my skin look washed out and dry it seems to have changed my skin texture too. While a second penned: \"This literally brought me out in hives all round my neck, and the skin on my face was bright red and burning. Face and neck were also intensely itchy. Even with antihistamines it took over 24 hours to settle and left me with lots of tiny spots.\" If you're in the market for a new SPF to try this summer, then you should try the B. Protect Defence Sun Cream SPF50 which cost \u00a314.99 in Superdrug. Popular among skincare influencers and developed by skincare experts, this product also leaves no white cast after application and has all the ideal active ingredients that'll 'deliver visible results'.", "summary": "The SPF is hugely popular and is currently on sale at Amazon for half its usual price", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/amazon-spf-reduces-dark-spots-29427817", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29428371.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_AMAZON_SPF_1JPG.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:01:00", "author": "Darcey Barrett", "authors": ["Darcey Barrett"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.308}

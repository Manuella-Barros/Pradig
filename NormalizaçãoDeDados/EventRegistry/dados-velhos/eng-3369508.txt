Notable exceptions were the iconic flower stalls near where the van came to a halt after killing at least 13 and injuring 100. And metal gates were closed at the entrance of La Boqueria, the expansive market that is one of the city's most famous tourist attractions.\n\nEnrique Camprubi, a city resident for 40 years who walks down Las Ramblas nearly every day, said besides the police, the scene didn't appear very changed.\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data? Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\n\"We don't have to be afraid,\" said Camprubi, who volunteers at a nearby center named after Mother Theresa. \"And we aren't afraid because that's what they want, the Islamic State, they want to scare us so that we stay at home. That is last thing we're going to do.\"\n\nThe number of pedestrians was about the same as a regular summer morning, but the crowd was much quieter than usual. Many somberly walked in silence, staring down at the distinctive curved paving stones.\n\nA family from New York said outside La Boqueria that they were undeterred when they boarded a plane last night after hearing about the attack.\n\n\"We all feel fine, right?\" Tara Lanza said as the whole family exchanged reassuring looks.\n\n\"It's sad,\" said her husband, John Lanza. \"You can tell it's obviously quieter than it usually is, but I think people are trying to get on with their lives.\"\n\nTheir tour guide, Gaston Magrinat, an American who came to Barcelona in 1999, said he couldn't help thinking that he or his kids could have been among the victims.\n\nPostal Service may be able to raise price of stamps this fall\n\n\"Thinking how often I come down this avenue? Not just for work but also with family,\" he said. \"It's a recreational area as well. You come with the kids and get ice cream and stuff like that.

Notable exceptions were the iconic flower stalls near where the van came to a halt after killing at least 13 and injuring 100. And metal gates were closed at the entrance of La Boqueria, the expansive market that is one of the city's most famous tourist attractions.\n\nEnrique Camprubi, a city resident for 40 years who walks down Las Ramblas nearly every day, said besides the police, the scene didn't appear very changed.\n\n\"We don't have to be afraid,\" said Camprubi, who volunteers at a nearby center named after Mother Theresa. \"And we aren't afraid because that's what they want, the Islamic State, they want to scare us so that we stay at home. That is last thing we're going to do.\"\n\nRELATED: Spanish police confirm 4 terror suspects near Barcelona to prevent 2nd attack\n\nThe number of pedestrians was about the same as a regular summer morning, but the crowd was much quieter than usual. Many somberly walked in silence, staring down at the distinctive curved paving stones.\n\nA family from New York said outside La Boqueria that they were undeterred when they boarded a plane last night after hearing about the attack.\n\n\"We all feel fine, right?\" Tara Lanza said as the whole family exchanged reassuring looks.\n\n\"It's sad,\" said her husband, John Lanza. \"You can tell it's obviously quieter than it usually is, but I think people are trying to get on with their lives.\"\n\nTheir tour guide, Gaston Magrinat, an American who came to Barcelona in 1999, said he couldn't help thinking that he or his kids could have been among the victims.\n\n\"Thinking how often I come down this avenue?

He said it was 'jam packed' with tourists.\n\nHe told Sky News: 'All of a sudden, I just sort of heard a crashing noise and the whole street just started to run, screaming. I saw a woman right next to me screaming for her kids.\n\n'Police were very, very quickly there, police officers with guns, batons, everywhere. Then the whole street started getting pushed back.'\n\nMr Anwar described the scene as 'chaos', with everyone in 'panic mode'.\n\nHe added: 'Police officers who got there just started screaming at people to move back, move back.\n\n'One of the shopkeepers tried to speak to him. He said he saw five or six people seriously injured on the ground, a van had driven into people.\n\n'And literally within probably 30 seconds, police vans, ambulances, police officers with guns, were piling out and we were being sectioned off and then being pushed rapidly back down Ramblas.'\n\nWill Ako, a 26-year-old tourist from London, was eating in a nearby restaurant called Taller De Tapas with his family when they heard something happening outside.\n\nHe told the Press Association: 'We had just finished eating and were about to leave when we heard a commotion and the patrons in the restaurant rushing from their seats.\n\nBarcelona attack suspects killed in shootout with police\n\n'I then saw people running to the east of the restaurant and I saw a couple of people about 30 yards down the road crouching around what looked like someone on the ground and they were calling for assistance.\n\n'Within a couple of minutes, police started to arrive and they were running west of the restaurant and some were telling us to stay inside.\n\n'Soon after, loads of cars, bikes and ambulances arrived and then the armed police.'\n\nHe said he was in the restaurant with around 40 people, adding: 'We're not sure what's happening.'\n\nAnother Barcelona eyewitness told LBC: 'I saw white van driving at 80-100kmph as it drove into groups of people.'\n\nBrendon Sissing is in Las Ramblas and said he saw 'people screaming and people being knocked down by this van'.\n\n'It knocked a whole bunch of people and just kept on going,' he said.\n\nTom Gueller, who lives on an adjoining road, was forced to flee the scene when he saw the van hurtling through the crowds.\n\nHe told BBC's PM: 'I heard screams and a bit of a crash and then I just saw the crowd parting and this van going full pelt down the middle of the Ramblas and I immediately knew that it was a terrorist attack or something like that.\n\nTourists urged to stay inside and away from Las Ramblas after Barcelona terror attack\n\n'I ran away, I mean I live near, I had to run back about 50 metres or so and go up to my flat and obviously see what's happening on the road from my balcony.'\n\nAsked about the van, he said: 'It wasn't slowing down at all. It was just going straight through the middle of the crowds in the middle of the Ramblas.'\n\nMr Gueller said many of the shops had pulled their shutters down and armed police were positioned on street corners, with cordons in place on the road.", "id": "9757695", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Witnesses describe terrifying scene at Las Ramblas after the Barcelona attack", "image": "https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/pri_49809792.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 117, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 128}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "BBC"}, "id": "302926", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Short Message Service"}, "id": "303499", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service"}, {"label": {"eng": "La Rambla, Barcelona"}, "id": "303748", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rambla,_Barcelona"}, {"label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}, "id": "306307", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sky News"}, "id": "307454", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News"}, {"label": {"eng": "Google+"}, "id": "357814", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 203, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement"}], "time": "18:57:00"}

Terror police have arrested two suspects.\n\nOne of them is believed to be Driss Oukabir, a Catalan resident in his late 20s of Moroccan origin. It is unclear who the second detained suspect is, but reports in Spain have suggested Oukabir's brother has been taken into custody.\n\nOukabir, who has reportedly served time in a Spanish prison, had earlier rented one of the vans used in the deadly attack. The suspect is being treated 'as a terrorist', police in Barcelona have confirmed.\n\nHorrifying pictures and video from the scene show armed police and paramedics rushing around Las Ramblas, a busy promenade in the centre of the city, as victims lie hurt in the street.\n\nIt remains unclear how many attackers were involved in the massacre, which is being treated by police as an act of terrorism.\n\nThe president of Spain's Catalonia region says police have arrested two people following the van attack, which happened in Barcelona's bustling Las Ramblas district.\n\nIn a brief news conference this evening Carles Puigdemont said 12 people are confirmed dead and at least 80 have been hospitalised after the van drove onto a sidewalk and swerved through a busy pedestrian area.\n\nThe region's interior minister had earlier tweeted that 13 people had died in the attack.\n\nBarcelona Mayor Ada Colau says a moment of silence will be held in the city's main square at noon Friday 'to show that we are not scared and we are more united that ever'.\n\nPolice have confirmed that at least 84 people are hurt, with Catalonia's interior minister Joaquim Forn saying it is 'very possible' that the number of dead will rise because of the 'very serious' wounds to victims.\n\nThe civil guard has said the van used in the attack was rented by Oukabir in the town of Santa Perpetua de la Mogada, which is around 15 miles by road from the scene of today's killings.\n\nA second van was found parked in the town of Vic, which is around 50 miles north of Barcelona. Police believe it was meant to be used as a getaway vehicle.\n\nPolice are said to have now found a second transit van hired at the same time as the vehicle used in the attack.\n\nIt was found parked in the town of Vic some 50 miles north of Barcelona and officers believe that a second person involved in today's attack used it to get away from the Catalan capital.\n\nSpanish media had also reported that two armed men were holed up in a bar in downtown Barcelona and reported gunfire in the area but police later dismissed those reports.\n\nEyewitnesses reported seeing people running away and screaming after the terror attack happened.\n\nA witness called Angel said he had seen the attacker close up and described him as 'a young man, maximum 25 years old, chestnut brown hair and skinny.'\n\nOthers described him as about 5ft 6in tall and wearing a blue and white striped top.\n\nAnother witness, Isaac, said: 'The person was accelerating. He mounted the pavement to run people over. We saw the van passing by running people over at 50 miles an hour. It was as if it was driving through a field of corn.'\n\nA taxi driver told Catalan TV station TV3: 'The van was doing zigzags knocking over everyone he could. It was shocking.'\n\nSteve Garrett was in a nearby market and sheltered in a bakery with several others after streams of people ran inside.\n\nOne member of the group, who took refuge with him, said she had heard gunshots after the incident.\n\nMr Garrett told the BBC: 'A very large number of people ran into the market area in a big kind of way, lots of screaming, lots of shouting.\n\n'The security guards immediately responded. We ran into the bakery with four or five other people and ran straight upstairs and hunkered down whilst an enormous wave of people went through the market.\n\n'Obviously coming from England it was reminding me a great deal of what happened in London, so we were very concerned about what might be going on next.\n\n'The lady that was with us said she heard some gunshots.'\n\nMr Garrett said a 'second wave' of people then entered the market, followed by armed police.\n\nHe said: 'They seemed to sweep through the market area. They seemed to be looking for someone. They were going very carefully, very cautiously, stall to stall.'\n\nPolice were reported to have found a Spanish passport inside the van.\n\nSpanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy said he is in contact with all emergency services and stressed the priority is to help the injured.\n\nArmed police were also seen rushing into the area while emergency services asked to close Metro and train stations in the city.\n\nOne witness told Sky News: 'It was quite terrifying. All of a sudden scores of people ran towards us, hysterical, children hysterical... first of all they said someone had been shot.\n\n'All of a sudden a second wave of people came down the street, we just ran, I lost my husband in the melee. The shops went into lockdown mode.'\n\nShe added: 'We really had no idea what was going on other than that we needed to get ourselves out of there very quickly... there was just hundreds of people running away very quickly.'\n\nAnother said: 'We were just told to run, it must have been quite close because... there was an immediate stampede to run away. We were just a minute away from it.'\n\nThe local police force was said to be evacuating the area including the nearby main square the Plaza de Catalunya.\n\nEl Periodico said the CIA had warned local police two months ago that La Rambla could be the scene of a terrorist attack.\n\n'Huge collision on Las Ramblas in Barcelona by an individual driving a van, many injuries,' a statement from Catalan police said.\n\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May has said Britain 'stands with Spain against terror' in response to the tragic news.\n\nShe added: 'My thoughts are with the victims of today's terrible attack in Barcelona and the emergency services responding to this ongoing incident. The UK stands with Spain against terror.'\n\nUS President Donald Trump condemned the attack and promised to do 'whatever is necessary to help' the Spanish.\n\nAs news of the atrocity was breaking, US First Lady Melania Trump tweeted: 'Thoughts and prayers to #Barcelona'.\n\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, tweeted: 'My thoughts are with the victims of this barbaric terrorist attack in the great city of Barcelona and with their brave emergency services.'\n\nMr Khan added: 'London stands with Barcelona against the evil of terrorism.'\n\nThe United States offered its assistance to Spain, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson adding that consular assistance was being provided to Americans in the city. He also urged US nationals to check in with their families.\n\n'Terrorists around the world should know - the United States and our allies are resolved to find you and bring you to justice,' Tillerson told a press conference with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and their Japanese counterparts.\n\nAamer Anwar was walking down Las Ramblas at the time, which he said was 'jam-packed' with tourists.\n\nHe told Sky News: 'All of a sudden, I just sort of heard a crashing noise and the whole street just started to run, screaming. I saw a woman right next to me screaming for her kids.\n\n'Police were very, very quickly there, police officers with guns, batons, everywhere. Then the whole street started getting pushed back.'\n\nMr Anwar described the scene as 'chaos', with everyone in 'panic mode'.\n\nHe added: 'Police officers who got there just started screaming at people to move back, move back.\n\n'One of the shopkeepers tried to speak to him. He said he saw five or six people seriously injured on the ground, a van had driven into people.\n\n'And literally within probably 30 seconds, police vans, ambulances, police officers with guns, were piling out and we were being sectioned off and then being pushed rapidly back down Ramblas.'\n\nWill Ako, 26, from London, was eating in a restaurant called Taller De Tapas with his family when they heard a disturbance.\n\nHe told the Press Association: 'We had just finished eating and were about to leave when we heard a commotion and the patrons in the restaurant rushing from their seats.\n\n'I then saw people running to the east of the restaurant and I saw a couple of people about 30 yards down the road crouching around what looked like someone on the ground and they were calling for assistance.\n\n'Within a couple of minutes, police started to arrive and they were running west of the restaurant and some were telling us to stay inside.\n\n'Soon after, loads of cars, bikes and ambulances arrived and then the armed police.'\n\nHe said he was in the restaurant with around 40 people, adding: 'We're not sure what's happening.'\n\nTom Gueller, who lives on an adjoining road, was forced to flee the scene when he saw the van hurtling through the crowds.\n\nHe told BBC's PM: 'I heard screams and a bit of a crash and then I just saw the crowd parting and this van going full pelt down the middle of the Ramblas and I immediately knew that it was a terrorist attack or something like that.\n\n'I ran away, I mean I live near, I had to run back about 50 metres or so and go up to my flat and obviously see what's happening on the road from my balcony.'\n\nAsked about the van, he said: 'It wasn't slowing down at all. It was just going straight through the middle of the crowds in the middle of the Ramblas.'\n\nMr Gueller said many of the shops had pulled their shutters down and armed police were positioned on street corners, with cordons in place on the road.\n\nTourist Mel Higgins told Sky News she was barricaded into a shop with her daughters at the time of the incident.\n\nShe said: 'I was with my two daughters and we were walking down the Passeig de Gracia, which is sort of parallel and one up from Las Ramblas, when suddenly people just started running towards us, screaming and shouting: 'Run! Run! Run!'.\n\n'So I grabbed the two girls and there was an Orange phone shop was open and we ran inside and they locked the doors of the phone shop, and we just all waited there for I suppose about 20 minutes.\n\n'And then it seemed very calm out on the street. And obviously the people working in Orange were in touch with the police and the police said just stay there for now.\n\n'Then about 20 minutes later, they said we could leave and we were just about to leave when people started running again, and screaming, and they said: 'Everyone back in!'.'\n\nThomas Riley, a civil servant from London, 22, had just left Catalunya station 300 feet from Las Ramblas with his father and brother when he heard 'shouting and crying'.\n\nThe trio were directed back into the Metro station and locked in by police, before being ordered to take the first train.\n\nHe told MailOnline: 'There was lots of commotion, shouting, and people crying. I was very frightened because no one would speak English to me.\n\n'The emergency services and officials acted very swiftly and we were directed back down onto the metro station and locked there for a while.\n\n'I still had no idea what had happened by this point. An empty train arrived at a platform and we were all told to get on it quickly!\n\n'Once the station was empty, we were taken out of the area a few stops picking people up en route.'\n\nMr Riley said the terrified passengers were directed by police to the seafront, where they were asked to 'hide' due to reports of gunmen on the loose.\n\nHe said: 'Lots of people on the tube were in tears. Once I got above ground, the streets were cut off by police everywhere.\n\n'There was lots of confusion and people checking phones. The police told us to stay calm and hide due to reports of gunmen.\n\n'Eventually, we were directed to the sea front by officials and I was asked if I had information by the police.'\n\nAuthorities in the area have warned people to stay away from the area.\n\nThe incident has taken place at the height of the tourist season in Barcelona, which is one of Europe's top travel destinations with at least 11 million visitors a year.\n\nMore to follow...", "id": "9807836", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Barcelona crash: Van ploughs into people in Las Ramblas", "image": null,

Notably still closed were the iconic flower stalls near where the van came to a halt after killing at least 13 and injuring 100. And metal gates covered the entrance to La Boqueria, the expansive market that is one of the city's most famous tourist attractions.\n\nA man jogs by armed police officers standing next to their vans on a street in Las Ramblas, Barcelona, Spain, Friday, Aug. 18, 2017.

That is last thing we're going to do.\"\n\nThe number of pedestrians was about the same as a regular summer morning, but the crowd was much quieter than usual. Many somberly walked in silence, staring down at the distinctive curved paving stones.\n\nA family from New York said outside La Boqueria that they were undeterred when they boarded a plane the previous evening after hearing about the attack.\n\n\"We all feel fine, right?\" Tara Lanza said as the whole family exchanged reassuring looks.\n\n\"It's sad,\" said her husband, John Lanza. \"You can tell it's obviously quieter than it usually is, but I think people are trying to get on with their lives.\"\n\nThe calm of the morning faded away, somewhat, when thousands of people who had gathered for a minute of silence in the square started making their way down Las Ramblas, continuing to chant and clap in unison as they headed toward the seashore. The ice cream shops closed again.\n\nA small memorial of flowers was placed at a fountain that is a common gathering-spot for FC Barcelona fans, as the crowds dispersed and the quiet returned.\n\nTour guide Gaston Magrinat, an American who came to Barcelona in 1999, said he couldn't help thinking that he or his kids could have been among the victims.\n\n\"Thinking how often I come down this avenue? Not just for work but also with family,\" he said. \"It's a recreational area as well. You come with the kids and get ice cream and stuff like that. It could have easily been me.\"\n\nPeople walk in Las Ramblas, Barcelona, Spain, Friday, Aug. 18, 2017.

Then, to the horror of those nearest to it, the driver revved the engine, mounted the pavement, and began to accelerate. Swerving from side to side, the driver hunted down victims who were trying to escape.\n\nThe famous tourist attraction had been as it always is on an August afternoon: packed with stallholders and tourists, lined with human statues and with people enjoying chilled cava outside the many cafes.\n\nWithin seconds, the attacker had left the street strewn with dead and injured people, while hundreds of others fled, many of them screaming.\n\nIt had taken the van a few seconds to travel almost 500m down the packed street, ending up straddling the famous mosaic by the artist Joan M\u00edro, its front end almost torn off by the force of its impacts with people.\n\nJordi Lino was on a bus going down Las Ramblas when the attack began. \"First I saw people running and then the van. There were injured people in the middle of the Ramblas.\"\n\nA taxi driver told Spanish TV that he saw people being run over by the van, as did Lourdes Porcar: \"It was going very fast, without caring about who was in its way.\"\n\nTom Markwell, from New Orleans, had just arrived in a taxi when he heard the screaming. \"It sounded like they were screaming for a movie star. Then I saw the van. It had already been busted on the front. It was weaving left and right, trying to hit people as fast as possible. There were people lying on the ground.\"\n\nLiam Searle said: \"I was very, very close to it. It was like 10ft from me. I luckily wasn't on the Ramblas, I was in the road, and I quickly ran into...I think it was the opera house, along with everyone else.\n\n\"Everyone was hiding behind things. And no one had a clue what was going on. We just heard a load of bangs and some other things and then, like, everyone just ran.\"\n\nAlbert Tort, an off-duty nurse who was one of the first on the scene, said he tried to give an Italian tourist life-saving treatment, but there was nothing he could do. \"The pavement was full of bodies.\"\n\nThe first that most people knew of the attack was when others around them started to run away in panic.\n\nAamer Anwar, a human rights lawyer and rector at the University of Glasgow, was attending a conference in the city, and said the fleeing crowd was like an avalanche.\n\nLas Ramblas had been \"mobbed\" with tourists, he said. \"I had been to the cathedral and walking down Las Ramblas for something to eat. Part of it was in the shade so I decided to keep walking down and literally within 10 seconds there was a crashing noise.\n\n\"The whole street just started to run screaming. I saw a woman running, when we stopped she was screaming, because she could not see her children.\n\n\"People started running and jumping into shops. I ran for about 50 or 100 metres and stopped to see what was happening.\n\n\"I could see chaos right at the top area and I spoke to a shopkeeper who had run down and was screaming. He was Bengali so I spoke to him in Urdu, and he said a van had driven into a crowd and he thought there were five to six people very seriously injured.\n\n\"Literally within 30 seconds police vans, ambulances, police officers with guns were piling out, and we were sectioned off and then being pushed rapidly back,\" he said.\n\nMany people fled into the cafes and stores that line Las Ramblas, and hid inside behind shutters that were pulled down after them. For a period, police insisted they stay inside while the area was searched.\n\nTourist Mel Higgins said she and her two daughters were walking down a nearby street when people began running towards them screaming and shouting. The trio ran into an Orange mobile phone shop where the staff locked the doors and everyone waited for about 20 minutes.\n\n\"Then it seemed very calm out on the street, and obviously the people working in Orange were in touch with the police and the police said just stay there for now. Then about 20 minutes later, they said we could leave, and we were just about to leave when people started running again, and screaming, and they said: 'everyone back in'.\"\n\nCarol Augustin, a manager at La Palau Moja, an 18th-century building on Las Ramblas that houses government offices and a tourism information centre, said the van passed right in front of the building.\n\n\"People started screaming and running into the office. It was such a chaotic situation. There were families with children. The police made us close the doors and wait inside.\"\n\nAmbulance crews arrived quickly and began tending to the injured, while police officers began searching for the attacker, sealed off the area and told people to leave the scene.\n\nRhys Richards, who is in Barcelona on holiday, said: \"I saw one person lying on the ground receiving CPR and another person lying on the ground motionless. You don't think it can happen to you. It was horrible and terrifying.\"\n\nSteve Garrett, who was in a nearby market, took shelter in a bakery with several others after streams of people ran inside. One member of the group said she had heard gunshots after the incident.\n\n\"We ran into the bakery with four or five other people and ran straight upstairs and hunkered down whilst an enormous wave of people went through the market.\n\n\"Obviously coming from England it was reminding me a great deal of what happened in London, so we were very concerned about what might be going on next. The lady that was with us said she heard some gunshots.\"\n\nMr Garrett said a \"second wave\" of people then entered the market, followed by armed police. \"They seemed to sweep through the market area. They seemed to be looking for someone. They were going very carefully, very cautiously, stall to stall.\"\n\nSteven Turner, who works in the area, told the BBC: \"People in my office saw a van ramming into people on Las Ramblas. I saw about three or four people lying on the ground.\"\n\nAnother witness said: \"We were just told to run, it must have been quite close because...there was an immediate stampede to run away. We were just a minute away from it.\"\n\nSeveral metro stations were closed, and police appealed to people to stay indoors before they gradually evacuated the area.", "id": "9807906", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Barcelona attack witnesses: 'The pavement was full of bodies'", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3190100.1503003745!/image/image.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "109", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Palau"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "185", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palau", "label": {"eng": "Palau"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "189069", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Police"}, "id": "302532", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cathedral"}, "id": "302884", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}, "id": "303239", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Road"}, "id": "303306", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bus"}, "id": "303307", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}, "id": "303577", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}, "id": "303588", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tourism"}, "id": "303659", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"}, {"label": {"eng": "La Rambla, Barcelona"}, "id": "303748", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rambla,_Barcelona"}, {"label": {"eng": "Road surface"}, "id": "303960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_surface"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}, "id": "304357", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Van"}, "id": "306459", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mosaic"}, "id": "309884", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coffeehouse"}, "id": "311282", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeehouse"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bengali language"}, "id": "313641", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Urdu"}, "id": "322600", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu"}, {"label": {"eng": "Avalanche"}, "id": "335235", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of Glasgow"}, "id": "337348", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow"}, {"label": {"eng": "Opera house"}, "id": "360914", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_house"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aamer Anwar"}, "id": "472275", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aamer_Anwar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya, Barcelona"}, "id": "568302", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pla\u00e7a_de_Catalunya,_Barcelona"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 203, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement"}], "time": "19:17:00"}

The passport of a Spanish citizen, of Moroccan origin, was found at the scene.\n\nThe identity of the arrested man is not clear.\n\nThere were also reports that detectives believe two vans were used, one for the attack and a second as a getaway vehicle.\n\nInitial reports suggested suspects had been holed up in a city centre bar surrounded by police, but authorities dismissed this saying there was no-one in the bar.\n\nThe attack - the first major terror-related killing on Spanish soil since more than 190 people died in the Madrid train bombs in 2004 - brought widespread condemnation.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the \"UK stands with Spain against terror\" and President Donald Trump said the \"United States \"will do whatever is necessary to help.

The passport of a Spanish citizen, of Moroccan origin, was found at the scene.\n\nThe identity of the arrested man is not clear.\n\nHowever, police have released an image of a suspect following the terror attack.\n\nREAD MORE: Barcelona attack: Nicola Sturgeon expresses support for victims\n\nThere were also reports that detectives believe two vans were used, one for the attack and a second as a getaway vehicle.\n\nInitial reports suggested suspects had been holed up in a city centre bar surrounded by police, but authorities dismissed this saying there was no-one in the bar.\n\nThe attack - the first major terror-related killing on Spanish soil since more than 190 people died in the Madrid train bombs in 2004 - brought widespread condemnation.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the \"UK stands with Spain against terror\" and President Donald Trump said the \"United States \"will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!\"\n\nVideo captured by eyewitnesses and circulating on social media showed the bloody aftermath of the incident.\n\nMany victims, some bleeding heavily, were visible in one clip - lying amid piles of souvenirs apparently sent flying in the chaos.\n\nLawyer and University of Glasgow rector Aamer Anwar was walking in La Ramblas when he heard screaming.\n\nHe said a shopkeeper told him five or six people were badly injured and described the scene as \"chaos\".\n\nMr Anwar told the media: \"I had been to the Cathedral and was walking down La Ramblas for something to eat.\n\n\"Part of it was in the shade so I decided to keep walking down and literally within 10 seconds there was a crashing noise.\n\n\"I turned around and people were screaming. I could see a woman screaming with her kids. People started running and jumping into shops.\n\n\"I ran for about 50 or 100 metres and stopped to see what was happening.\n\n\"The police were very quickly on the scene and getting people to move back.\n\n\"I could see chaos right at the top area and I spoke to a shopkeeper who had run down and was screaming.\n\n\"He was Bengali so I spoke to him in Urdu and he said a van had driven into a crowd and he thought there were five to six people very seriously injured.\"\n\n\"They seemed to be looking for someone. They were going very carefully, very cautiously, stall to stall.\"\n\nWill Ako, 26, from London, was eating in a restaurant called Taller De Tapas with his family when they heard a disturbance.\n\nHe told the Press Association: \"We had just finished eating and were about to leave when we heard a commotion and the patrons in the restaurant rushing from their seats.\n\n\"I then saw people running to the east of the restaurant and I saw a couple of people, about 30 yards down the road, crouching around what looked like someone on the ground and they were calling for assistance.\n\n\"Within a couple of minutes, police started to arrive and they were running west of the restaurant and some were telling us to stay inside.\n\n\"Soon after, loads of cars, bikes and ambulances arrived and then

As thousands of tourists enjoyed the late afternoon sun on a popular tree-lined avenue in Barcelona, a fanatic in a rented Fiat van came hurtling towards them.\n\nUnsuspecting holidaymakers were sent flying into stalls selling souvenirs. Others were simply mown down as the terrorist zigzagged along the pedestrianised area of the tourist hotspot called Las Ramblas, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nWhen he ended his murderous 500-yard rampage, dozens of bodies lay across the cobbled streets where thousands of families had been enjoying their holidays.\n\nSome had been killed instantly. Shocked bystanders tried to tend to the catastrophic injuries suffered by dozens of others.\n\nAmid the chaos, frantic mothers could be heard screaming the names of their missing children. At least one young girl is thought to have been killed.\n\nHundreds of tourists and locals fled in panic, seeking sanctuary inside shops, restaurants and churches amid fears that terrorists were still wreaking havoc.\n\nBriton Susan Maclean, on holiday with her husband, described her 'unbridled fear' last night. \"All of a sudden, there was this screaming and hordes of people, like a tidal wave of people, fear etched in their faces, running towards us, many of them yelling in Spanish,\" she told Channel 4 News.\n\n\"We had no idea what was going on. My first thought was this is a terrorist attack.\" The couple barricaded themselves inside a shop while they heard what sounded like gunshots outside.\n\nAamer Anwar, a criminal defence lawyer and Glasgow University rector, said he missed the attack by ten seconds.\n\n\"I was about to sit down and have something to eat... the place was jam-packed with tourists,\" he said. \"Thousands and thousands of tourists. I walked on and about five, ten seconds later I heard a crashing noise, screams and it was almost like an avalanche - I just saw people running. I started running, people in front of me started to run, hundreds. People were screaming. People stated to panic.\n\n\"People were jumping into shops, pulling their children out of prams. There was no room [on Las Ramblas], it was swamped with families, children, and tourists. I saw a woman running. When we stopped she was screaming, because she could not see her children.\"\n\nEthan Spidey, 25, said there was a 'stampede' as tourists and locals sprinted away from the scene.\n\n\"I saw a young child knocked over and picked them up but everyone was just running,\" he said. \"There was a stampede in the streets alongside Las Ramblas as everyone tried to run away. People were running into shops and taking refuge in cafes.\"\n\nThe carnage unfolded when the van mounted the paved middle section of Las Ramblas and gathered speed as the driver headed south towards the waterfront. Images of the aftermath showed several bodies lying on the street at the start of his rampage shortly after 5pm local time.\n\nThe fanatic, possibly travelling with an accomplice, continued to ram pedestrians before finally abandoning the white van on a street mural some 500 yards later.\n\nHe is thought to have fled through La Boqueria food market, which is popular with tourists and locals alike. Within minutes, armed police surrounded the area and carried out searches of every business as hundreds hid in shops, restaurants and churches.\n\nTom Gueller, who lives on a road adjoining the site of the attack, was forced to flee when the van began hitting pedestrians. \"I heard screams and a crash and then I just saw the crowd parting and this van going full pelt down the middle of the Ramblas, and I immediately knew that it was a terrorist attack or something like that,\" he said.\n\nAsked about the van, he added: \"It wasn't slowing down at all. It was just going straight through the middle of the crowds in the middle of the Ramblas.\"\n\nSteven Turner, who works in the area, told the BBC: \"People in my office saw a van ramming into people on Las Ramblas. I saw about three or four people lying on the ground. About five minutes later I heard lots of screams from the crowd and then they dispersed.\"\n\nTerrified witnesses told how they heard gunshots as armed police went shop-by-shop in search of their suspects.\n\nBritish tourist Mel Higgins said: \"I was barricaded inside a shop with my two daughters. We were walking down a parallel street when suddenly people started running towards us screaming 'Run!' and so I grabbed the two girls and ran inside an Orange phone shop.\n\n\"They locked the doors of the phone shop and we all waited there for around 20 minutes. We were just about to leave when everybody started running and screaming again. We went back inside and the staff shut down the shutters and told us to go upstairs.\"\n\nMrs Higgins was finally reunited with her husband some 25 minutes later.\n\nChris Pawley, 30 - who survived the Manchester Arena bomb - was yards from Las Ramblas when the carnage unfolded.

As thousands of tourists enjoyed the late afternoon sun on a popular tree-lined avenue in Barcelona, a fanatic in a rented Fiat van came hurtling towards them.\n\nUnsuspecting holidaymakers were sent flying into stalls selling souvenirs. Others were simply mown down as the terrorist zigzagged along the pedestrianised area of the tourist hotspot called Las Ramblas.\n\nWhen he ended his murderous 500-yard rampage, dozens of bodies lay across the cobbled streets where thousands of families had been enjoying their holidays.\n\nSome had been killed instantly. Shocked bystanders tried to tend to the catastrophic injuries suffered by dozens of others.\n\nAmid the chaos, frantic mothers could be heard screaming the names of their missing children. At least one young girl is thought to have been killed, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nHundreds of tourists and locals fled in panic, seeking sanctuary inside shops, restaurants and churches amid fears that terrorists were still wreaking havoc.\n\nBriton Susan Maclean, on holiday with her husband, described her 'unbridled fear' last night. 'All of a sudden, there was this screaming and hordes of people, like a tidal wave of people, fear etched in their faces, running towards us, many of them yelling in Spanish,' she told Channel 4 News.\n\n\"We had no idea what was going on. My first thought was this is a terrorist attack.\" The couple barricaded themselves inside a shop while they heard what sounded like gunshots outside.\n\nAamer Anwar, a criminal defence lawyer and Glasgow University rector, said he missed the attack by ten seconds. \"I was about to sit down and have something to eat... the place was jam-packed with tourists,\" he said. \"Thousands and thousands of tourists. I walked on and about five, ten seconds later I heard a crashing noise, screams and it was almost like an avalanche - I just saw people running. I started running, people in front of me started to run, hundreds. People were screaming. People stated to panic.\n\n\"People were jumping into shops, pulling their children out of prams. There was no room [on Las Ramblas], it was swamped with families, children, and tourists. I saw a woman running. When we stopped she was screaming, because she could not see her children.\"\n\nEthan Spidey, 25, said there was a 'stampede' as tourists and locals sprinted away from the scene.\n\n\"I saw a young child knocked over and picked them up but everyone was just running,\" he said. \"There was a stampede in the streets alongside Las Ramblas as everyone tried to run away. People were running into shops and taking refuge in cafes.\"\n\nThe carnage unfolded when the van mounted the paved middle section of Las Ramblas and gathered speed as the driver headed south towards the waterfront. Images of the aftermath showed several bodies lying on the street at the start of his rampage shortly after 5pm local time.\n\nThe fanatic, possibly travelling with an accomplice, continued to ram pedestrians before finally abandoning the white van on a street mural some 500 yards later.\n\nHe is thought to have fled through La Boqueria food market, which is popular with tourists and locals alike. Within minutes, armed police surrounded the area and carried out searches of every business as hundreds hid in shops, restaurants and churches.\n\nTom Gueller, who lives on a road adjoining the site of the attack, was forced to flee when the van began hitting pedestrians. \"I heard screams and a crash and then I just saw the crowd parting and this van going full pelt down the middle of the Ramblas, and I immediately knew that it was a terrorist attack or something like that,\" he said.\n\nAsked about the van, he added: \"It wasn't slowing down at all. It was just going straight through the middle of the crowds in the middle of the Ramblas.\"\n\nSteven Turner, who works in the area, told the BBC: 'People in my office saw a van ramming into people on Las Ramblas. I saw about three or four people lying on the ground. About five minutes later I heard lots of screams from the crowd and then they dispersed.' Terrified witnesses told how they heard gunshots as armed police went shop-by-shop in search of their suspects.\n\nBritish tourist Mel Higgins said: 'I was barricaded inside a shop with my two daughters. We were walking down a parallel street when suddenly people started running towards us screaming 'Run!' and so I grabbed the two girls and ran inside an Orange phone shop.\n\n\"They locked the doors of the phone shop and we all waited there for around 20 minutes. We were just about to leave when everybody started running and screaming again. We went back inside and the staff shut down the shutters and told us to go upstairs.\" Mrs Higgins was finally reunited with her husband some 25 minutes later.\n\nChris Pawley, 30 - who survived the Manchester Arena bomb - was yards from Las Ramblas when the carnage unfolded. He had been enjoying a trip to the Spanish city with his partner Corey Lorde.\n\nHe said: \"We were caught up in the Arena attack - I can't believe it. There was police everywhere and ambulances, the shops started putting the shutters down.\" A second van was later found in the town of Vic, 50 miles north of Barcelona. Police believe it was meant to be used as a getaway vehicle.\n\nBritish holidaymakers in Barcelona were told to stay in their hotels by the Foreign Office last night.\n\nThe warning came as it was claimed that the CIA warned that Las Ramblas was a terror target two months ago.\n\nCity authorities were reportedly told about the possibility of an attack at the tourist hotspot following six atrocities across Europe in which terrorists have used vehicles in the last year, claiming more than 100 lives.\n\nCIA officers met the region's local police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, to warn that Las Ramblas could be a target, Spanish newspaper El Periodico said.\n\nThe newspaper claimed: \"The Central Intelligence Agency moved its notice to the Catalan autonomous police two months ago. It even put the focus on the Ramblas.\"\n\nEarlier in May, the US issued a new terror alert for Europe after attacks in London, Stockholm, Berlin and Nice.\n\nLast night the Foreign Office said: 'Local authorities have advised people to stay inside and stay away from the Las Ramblas area; if you're in the immediate area you should take care and follow the advice of security authorities.'\n\nMore than 12million British nationals visit Spain every year, with Barcelona the most popular city destination. Advice from the Foreign Office warns: \"Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Spain.\"\n\nIt added: \"Attacks could be indiscriminate...you should be vigilant and follow the instructions of the local authorities.\"", "id": "9849798", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Stampede as tourists fled: Witnesses tell of how a carefree afternoon turned into bloodbath along Las Ramblas", "image": "http://www.tert.am/news_images/821/2460308_3/f59969fa569b0d_59969fa569b4e.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Police"}, "id": "302532", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police"}, {"label": {"eng": "BBC"}, "id": "302926", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tree"}, "id": "303587", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tourism"}, "id": "303659", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"}, {"label": {"eng": "La Rambla, Barcelona"}, "id": "303748", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rambla,_Barcelona"}, {"label": {"eng": "Road surface"}, "id": "303960", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_surface"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}, "id": "304357", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central Intelligence Agency"}, "id": "307351", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency"}, {"label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}, "id": "307492", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mossos d'Esquadra"}, "id": "311343", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossos_d'Esquadra"}, {"label": {"eng": "Catalan language"}, "id": "311570", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Foreign and Commonwealth Office"}, "id": "327110", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office"}, {"label": {"eng": "Channel 4 News"}, "id": "328432", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4_News"}, {"label": {"eng": "University of Glasgow"}, "id": "337348", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow"}, {"label": {"eng": "El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya"}, "id": "337551", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Peri\u00f3dico_de_Catalunya"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manchester Arena"}, "id": "385627", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Arena"}, {"label": {"eng": "Royals (song)"}, "id": "430672", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorde"}, {"label": {"eng": "Street or road name"}, "id": "469019", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_or_road_name"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aamer Anwar"}, "id": "472275", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aamer_Anwar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Catastrophic injury"}, "id": "477667", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_injury"}, {"label": {"eng": "La Boqueria"}, "id": "766263", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Boqueria"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}], "time": "08:15:00"}

As thousands of tourists enjoyed the late afternoon sun on a popular tree-lined avenue in Barcelona, a fanatic in a rented Fiat van came hurtling towards them.\n\nUnsuspecting holidaymakers were sent flying into stalls selling souvenirs. Others were simply mown down as the terrorist zigzagged along the pedestrianised area of the tourist hotspot called Las Ramblas.\n\nWhen he ended his murderous 500-yard rampage, dozens of bodies lay across the cobbled streets where thousands of families had been enjoying their holidays.\n\nFleeing: A girl with her mother pushing a buggy\n\nSome had been killed instantly. Shocked bystanders tried to tend to the catastrophic injuries suffered by dozens of others.\n\nAmid the chaos, frantic mothers could be heard screaming the names of their missing children. At least one young girl is thought to have been killed.\n\nHundreds of tourists and locals fled in panic, seeking sanctuary inside shops, restaurants and churches amid fears that terrorists were still wreaking havoc.\n\nBriton Susan Maclean, on holiday with her husband, described her 'unbridled fear' last night. 'All of a sudden, there was this screaming and hordes of people, like a tidal wave of people, fear etched in their faces, running towards us, many of them yelling in Spanish,' she told Channel 4 News.\n\n'We had no idea what was going on. My first thought was this is a terrorist attack.' The couple barricaded themselves inside a shop while they heard what sounded like gunshots outside.\n\nAamer Anwar, a criminal defence lawyer and Glasgow University rector, said he missed the attack by ten seconds. 'I was about to sit down and have something to eat... the place was jam-packed with tourists,' he said. 'Thousands and thousands of tourists. I walked on and about five, ten seconds later I heard a crashing noise, screams and it was almost like an avalanche - I just saw people running. I started running, people in front of me started to run, hundreds. People were screaming. People stated to panic.\n\nDash to safety: The strain etched on his face, a father carries a distressed toddler\n\n'People were jumping into shops, pulling their children out of prams. There was no room [on Las Ramblas], it was swamped with families, children, and tourists. I saw a woman running. When we stopped she was screaming, because she could not see her children.'\n\nEthan Spidey, 25, said there was a 'stampede' as tourists and locals sprinted away from the scene.\n\n'I saw a young child knocked over and picked them up but everyone was just running,' he said. 'There was a stampede in the streets alongside Las Ramblas as everyone tried to run away. People were running into shops and taking refuge in cafes.'\n\nThe carnage unfolded when the van mounted the paved middle section of Las Ramblas and gathered speed as the driver headed south towards the waterfront. Images of the aftermath showed several bodies lying on the street at the start of his rampage shortly after 5pm local time.\n\nThe fanatic, possibly travelling with an accomplice, continued to ram pedestrians before finally abandoning the white van on a street mural some 500 yards later.\n\nHe is thought to have fled through La Boqueria food market, which is popular with tourists and locals alike. Within minutes, armed police surrounded the area and carried out searches of every business as hundreds hid in shops, restaurants and churches.\n\nHorrified: The ordeal is too much for these young girls\n\nTom Gueller, who lives on a road adjoining the site of the attack, was forced to flee when the van began hitting pedestrians. 'I heard screams and a crash and then I just saw the crowd parting and this van going full pelt down the middle of the Ramblas, and I immediately knew that it was a terrorist attack or something like that,' he said.\n\nAsked about the van, he added: 'It wasn't slowing down at all. It was just going straight through the middle of the crowds in the middle of the Ramblas.'\n\nSteven Turner, who works in the area, told the BBC: 'People in my office saw a van ramming into people on Las Ramblas. I saw about three or four people lying on the ground. About five minutes later I heard lots of screams from the crowd and then they dispersed.' Terrified witnesses told how they heard gunshots as armed police went shop-by-shop in search of their suspects.\n\nManhunt: Armed police search the streets\n\nBritish tourist Mel Higgins said: 'I was barricaded inside a shop with my two daughters. We were walking down a parallel street when suddenly people started running towards us screaming 'Run!' and so I grabbed the two girls and ran inside an Orange phone shop.\n\n'They locked the doors of the phone shop and we all waited there for around 20 minutes. We were just about to leave when everybody started running and screaming again. We went back inside and the staff shut down the shutters and told us to go upstairs.' Mrs Higgins was finally reunited with her husband some 25 minutes later.\n\nChris Pawley, 30 - who survived the Manchester Arena bomb - was yards from Las Ramblas when the carnage unfolded. He had been enjoying a trip to the Spanish city with his partner Corey Lorde.\n\nHe said: 'We were caught up in the Arena attack - I can't believe it. There was police everywhere and ambulances, the shops started putting the shutters down.' A second van was later found in the town of Vic, 50 miles north of Barcelona. Police believe it was meant to be used as a getaway vehicle.\n\nStay in your hotels, Britons are urged\n\nBritish holidaymakers in Barcelona were told to stay in their hotels by the Foreign Office last night.\n\nThe warning came as it was claimed that the CIA warned that Las Ramblas was a terror target two months ago.\n\nCity authorities were reportedly told about the possibility of an attack at the tourist hotspot following six atrocities across Europe in which terrorists have used vehicles in the last year, claiming more than 100 lives.\n\nCIA officers met the region's local police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, to warn that Las Ramblas could be a target, Spanish newspaper El Periodico said.\n\nBritish holidaymakers in Barcelona were told to stay in their hotels by the Foreign Office last night\n\nThe newspaper claimed: 'The Central Intelligence Agency moved its notice to the Catalan autonomous police two months ago. It even put the focus on the Ramblas.'\n\nEarlier in May, the US issued a new terror alert for Europe after attacks in London, Stockholm, Berlin and Nice.\n\nLast night the Foreign Office said: 'Local authorities have advised people to stay inside and stay away from the Las Ramblas area; if you're in the immediate area you should take care and follow the advice of security authorities.'\n\nMore than 12million British nationals visit Spain every year, with Barcelona the most popular city destination.

She couldn't understand what people were saying in Spanish, but she knew it was bad.\n\n\"You could see the fear and the distress in these people, and the fact that they were screaming in terror. Regardless of what might have happened we knew we had to get ourselves out of there,\" she told CNN.\n\nElla Bartlett had just sat down with some friends at a restaurant in the nearby Plaza Real for a meal. They were looking at a menu when there was a sudden commotion.\n\n\"Once we saw that everyone was running, we just started running too. We didn't even know what we were running from,\" she said\n\nSome people hiding in a restaurant called Bartlett and her friends to join them, and they hid in a bathroom in the back with two other people, one of them a girl in tears.\n\n\"There were some people in the restaurant lobby looking out and all we could see from the windows was just people running around in the Plaza. It was really scary.\"\n\nShirazinia, who lives in Barcelona, said that he and some friends had been worried an attack was \"always around the corner.\"\n\n\"I know from speaking to a lot of of my friends from Barcelona, whenever tragedy has struck in other cities, around the world, in Europe especially, everybody felt that the Ramblas would be next. I don't think a lot of people are that surprised that it happened here,\" he said.\n\nHe also said that there had been a built-up police presence in the city for some time.\n\n\"It's a pretty obvious target. I noticed -- because I'm in and out of the city all the time -- I noticed a very, very large police presence. Check points, all over the city on the route to the airport, in the center, everywhere as kind of a show of force to, I guess, let the citizens and the tourists know that they are there and they are watching, and they are aware.\"\n\nLondon resident Charlie Parsons, 58, who was on vacation in Barcelona, was riding his bike when the attack happened about 20 meters or so away.\n\n\"I was on one side of Las Ramblas and suddenly a crowd of people came from my left screaming. Obviously, I felt something awful had happened,\" he told CNN. \"It's a weird thing but I froze and didn't initially flee with them.\"\n\nParsons, who said he rarely goes to Las Ramblas, started walking in the same direction that everyone was running. He ducked in a shop as the shutters closed.\n\n\"Before I got into the shop, I saw at least three people on the ground. Clearly, they had been mowed down,\" he said. \"I saw blood and didn't know what their condition was. I should have checked but what could I have done?\"\n\nIn the shop, \"people were shaking, kids screaming. It was complete panic,\" he said.\n\nHe said he then heard several gunshots, and one shot appeared to hit the metal shutters. About 10 minutes later, he left the shop through a back door.\n\n\"The streets were just weirdly ordinary and it was like people didn't know what had happened yet,\" he said.\n\nValerie Istre, an American tourist from Dallas, Texas, was shopping on Las Ramblas avenue when her friend suddenly dropped and broke her sunglasses. Seconds after they walked into a clothing store to buy a new pair, the attackers struck.\n\n\"At first, we had no idea what was happening,\" said Istre. \"We didn't speak the language. We knew it was bad and people looked scared. It was very surreal. You didn't know if it was just the van or if people were going to come in with guns.\"\n\nIstre was immediately phoned by a cousin who works as a news reporter in Dallas. He was able to explain what was happening.\n\n\"Some of us gathered toward the back around a storage room with a lock on the door,\" Istre said. \"The plan was to run inside and lock the door if needed.\"\n\nIstre estimates there were 75 people in the store, mostly tourists. \"People were crying, really freaking out. It was really scary.\"\n\nAfraid they were going to die, many of the patrons began texting family members to say goodbye.\n\n\"I didn't know if I would ever see my three kids again,\" said Istre. \"I sent my 12-year-old daughter a photo I had recently taken of me. I told her I loved her, but didn't say anything was wrong. I wanted her to have a nice, last picture of me in case something happened.\"\n\nIstre remained holed up in the store with the other patrons for three hours until police came to escort them out.\n\n\"Had my friend not dropped her sunglasses, we could have been hurt. It was very, very, very surreal,\" said Istre.\n\n\"It makes you want to go home and hug your kids,\" she said. \"But I also think it's this realization that you are never going to feel safe in the world we live in.

But the loud, terrifying bangs they heard turned out to be the sickening sound of bodies being struck by a van hurtling down Las Ramblas.\n\nOn Barcelona's busiest street, one of the most famous thoroughfares in Europe, terrorists had struck.\n\nAt just after 5.15pm local time, the two-ton white van had mounted the kerb at the northern end of Las Ramblas, which runs down to the seafront, and ploughed down its 40ft-wide pedestrianised centre. Two hours later, according to local reports, a second vehicle smashed through a police cordon injuring two officers. The driver of that car was reportedly shot dead.\n\nLas Ramblas, lined with bars and shops, was crowded with families on a typically hot, sunny afternoon when the terrorists first struck. Photographs and video footage taken in the aftermath show bodies strewn in the road, and prams and buggies upturned and abandoned.\n\nBarcelona terror attack: What we know so far 01:02\n\n\"The van was right next to me just hitting people,\" said Liam Searle, 22, from Chichester in Sussex, who had been skateboarding down the street with his headphones in. He had a remarkable escape. The van had driven right alongside him, he told The Daily Telegraph, before ploughing into a crowd and crashing to a halt.\n\n\"No one knew if it was a van, or a bomb or men with guns. Everyone was hiding behind things and no one had a clue what was going on. We just heard a load of bangs and then everyone ran.\"\n\nMr Searle added: \"I was skating in the road and had my headphones in when I heard massive bangs and thuds. I looked to my side and the van had stopped right next to me.\"\n\nThe van had crashed right next to him. It had zigzagged about a third of a mile down Las Ramblas before crashing into a crowd outside the Restaurant Maccabi, a kosher restaurant, before coming to a halt. The target is unlikely to have been a coincidence and suggested this was a well-planned attack.\n\nOn Las Ramblas, bystanders ran for their lives. Many stampeded into the famous La Boqueria food market.\n\nBriton Chris Pawley, who had also been caught up in the Manchester terror attack in June, told the Manchester Evening News: \"There were police everywhere and ambulances, the shops started putting the shutters down.\"\n\nA video on social media showed people lying injured on the pavement. Victims could be seen bleeding, some heavily, being tended to by passers-by.\n\nBrendon Sissing told how he saw the white van driving at \"100kmh\" (62mph) moments before it struck. \"People were screaming and being knocked down. It knocked a whole bunch of people down and just kept on going,\" he said, \"[The driver] stopped and then carried on, people were on the floor and under the van.\"\n\nAn eyewitness, giving his name as Isaac, said: \"We saw the van running people over at 80kmh (50mph). It was as if it was driving through a corn field.\"\n\nSusan Maclean, a Briton on holiday with her husband, said she was \"very lucky\" to have avoided the van as it ploughed through the crowds. She said: \"All of a sudden, there was this screaming and hordes of people, fear etched in their faces, were running towards us, many yelling in Spanish. We had no idea what was going on. My first thought was this is a terrorist attack.\"\n\nSteve Garrett, a British tourist, told of the terror as they huddled in the food market, fearful gunmen were on the loose. He thought of the attack on Borough Market in London in June.\n\nMr Garrett said: \"A large number of people ran into the market area. There was lots of screaming, lots of shouting. The security guards immediately responded. We ran into the bakery with four or five other people and ran straight upstairs whilst a wave of people went through the market.\n\n\"Obviously coming from England it reminded me a great deal of what happened in London, so we were very concerned about what might be going on. The lady that was with us said she heard gunshots.\"\n\nMr Garrett said a \"second wave\" of people entered the market, followed by armed police. He said: \"They seemed to sweep through the market as if they were looking for someone. They were going very carefully, very cautiously, stall to stall.\"\n\nAccounts differ but it is claimed the driver and possibly a passenger jumped from the vehicle and ran off. Gunshots were heard and there were claims, later denied officially, that the driver was holed up - possibly with hostages - in a Turkish restaurant.\n\nPolice on Thursday night said that two suspects had been arrested, but that the driver was still at large.\n\nA witness, who gave his name as Angel, said he saw the attacker. He described him as \"a young man, 25 years old, chestnut brown hair and skinny.\"\n\nOthers described him as 5ft 7in and wearing a blue and white striped top.\n\nMr Searle is adamant he saw two men flee the van after it crashed. \"That's when two men got out so I ran for my life,\" he recalled. He took shelter inside the Liceu Opera House. Others piled in behind him and once inside they locked the glass door. From there, Mr Searle could see the carnage.\n\n\"The doors were made of glass so we could see everything,\" he told The Daily Telegraph, \"I saw police officers and paramedics tending to a six or seven year old girl. She was screaming. I couldn't look anymore so I moved away. Then the injured came into the opera house for water and shelter. To see the things with the kids and stuff I don't know what to say. It's just shock.\"\n\nA second van linked to the attack - possibly a getaway vehicle - was found in the town of Vic in Catalonia. Police cordoned off the area and were inspecting the vehicle. Documents pinpointing the identities of the terrorists were said to be inside. More than two hours later, around 7.30pm local time, a white Ford Focus smashed through a police cordon on the Diagonal, a major road through the city, injuring two officers.\n\nThe driver was later shot dead by police in Sant Just Desvern, on the outskirts of the city.", "id": "9803033", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Las Ramblas terror: witnesses describe horror as van mounts

They had left Las Ramblas just minutes before the terrorists struck.\n\n\"Yesterday we ambled up Las Ramblas, just relaxing and stopping to buy souvenirs for our boys back home,\" she said.\n\n\"We were going to stop at a cafe on Las Ramblas but instead crossed the street, the same street the terrorist's van sped into seconds later. We sat down outside another bar for a drink. Then we heard a loud crash. I knew it wasn't a bomb. It sounded like a head-on collision. My husband saw the first few casualties laying on the road at the end of Las Ramblas and thought it was a car accident.\n\n\"All I could think of was the London attack and the men with the knifes. I thought these people running and screaming have seen someone, maybe someone killing someone with knives. I panicked and I ran down the street. Everyone was panicking.\n\n\"The police were running to the scene and blowing whistles, they were forcing the traffic to move faster, they were screaming, there were ambulances. People were being trampled over. I fell and lost my shoe. I ran to our hotel room and slammed the door behind me.\n\n\"Our hotel is right beside Las Ramblas. I switched off the lights and just sat in the dark. I haven't been out of the room since. There are cordons all around our hotel. We are going home on Friday. I just want to go home to my boys, my Mum, my family.\"\n\nThe Limavady woman says thinking of the hundreds of innocent families she had passed on her walk along Las Ramblas just before the attack made her very sad.\n\n\"Walking down Las Ramblas yesterday afternoon just before the attack there were so many families, young children, babies in prams, kids holding their Mummy and Daddy's hands. It's just unthinkable. That makes me so sad. The other thing I noticed was that there were so many armed police around yesterday. They were everywhere, carrying guns. I don't know if they had intelligence or were expecting something to happen, but there were an awful lot of them.\n\n\"You don't expect this on holidays at all. We were literally walking up that street, the same as those people who were killed.\n\n\"My Dad passed away last year and I think he was looking after us today. It's horrific to think on. I have cried tears today because it was as simple as that, minutes, a split decision. If we had of sat down at that first bar, if we had of decided to stay around the shops a little more, that would have changed everything.

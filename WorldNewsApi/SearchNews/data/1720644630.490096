{"id": 231232056, "title": "Two months holiday for everyone - and tell the truth!': As Penny Mordaunt and Angela Rayner clash in heated election TV debate we ask the Great British public - if you were Prime Minister for a day, what would YOU do?", "text": "Penny Mordaunt and Angela Rayner clashed over taxes and Trident last night in the fiery seven-way BBC election debate. The event descended into chaos when the Labour deputy leader and Tory Commons leader butted heads over the claim that a Labour government would add \u00a32,000 to a family's annual tax bill - as Rayner branded Mordaunt a 'liar' multiple times. However policies and plans from each Party jostling to get into Number 10 were hurled into the debate last night, such as the Greens promise to put \u00a330billion more into funding health services, Reform UK will crackdown on immigration, while the Lib Dems would bring an end to raw sewage being dumped in our rivers. But what would you do if you were in the hotseat for a day? Well MailOnline took to the streets of London, Birmingham and Sunderland to hear your Prime Ministerial plans. In London, pals Charlie and Milly immediately focused on the younger generation, and making it easier for people in schools. '[We would] close all the schools, give everyone a day off. And loosen the rules [around] A-Levels and GCSE , they are a lot of pressure and make it an easier and fairer system to get into University.' Whereas a lot of others focused on rebuilding trust and responsibility, which they thought had been damaged by the last government. Mary Beale's plan for this would be to 'bring all the people responsible for the NHS, the police, the army, to Number 10 Downing Street and I would introduce them to the general public. 'And say well you can't get your appointment, that is the guy to see. So they have to take responsibility for what they do. 'The PM is overall the head of it but I hate when they say Rishi Sunak hasn't done this. No, it is the people who run these services. We empower them to do it and they are not doing it.' Nicky Pinnar added that as our head of state she would just 'tell the truth', whereas Vittoiro thought there was no hope for any of the MPs and his first move would be 'to change 'all the MPs, get rid of all of them.' Carmen Donatantonio also focused on 'honesty' and 'sticking to what you believe in', whereas her husband Alfonso would 'take the money from the rich and give it to the poor'. Another key point for Londoners was the 'shambolic' state of our health services and how we can improve them. Joannah Lennox wanted to 'give healthcare workers better pay and look after the elderly and the special needs. I have a special needs son so it is really important to me that we look after those who are more vulnerable.' Similarly Mary Gilford wants to 'sort the NHS out because it is shambles.' Some however had different priorities that seemed to focus more on having a bit of fun. Kevin Maclevoy would 'reduce the price in pubs' and another man would give everyone 'two months holiday'. Meanwhile in Birmingham some of the best answers came from Jamie, 24 and Ellie, 22 who would give everyone free happy meals with the mission to just make politics 'more fun'. They said: 'We would make university free and free gym memberships and free happy meals. '[We] would just make it more fun, it wouldn't be so strict, you don't need to go in in suits. [We] would have a milkshake throwing competition.' Shaquille Melbourne, 27, would make martial arts compulsory in all schools, in a bid to boost mental health and wipe out bullying. 'If I was Prime Minister I would make marital arts compulsory in every school. I think it would improve mental health in schools. Kids would be so discipline. Bullying would not be a thing. '[We would have] the most elite nation in terms of martial arts the world has ever seen.' On more serious topics, Stephen Harding and Rita Harrison would improve the UKs relationship with the EU. Stephen Harding, 68 said: 'I would make plans to join the European economic area, to get us back into Europe without bringing back Brexit. I would also raise taxes to support better public services.' While Rita Harrison wanted to 'look at safe routes for asylum seekers and immigrants.' Adding: 'I would definitely be wanting to increase our work with the European Europe. I would look at funding the NHS. ' Michael Godwin, 32, would fix the trains: 'I would sort out the state of the railways, they are always going on strike and they are expensive. I would be happy to go on the train more if it wasn't so expensive.' In Sunderland Eilleen Weatherall, 89 would 'appoint all women MPs and sack all the others. MPs right now are only thinking about themselves.' 77-year-old Michael Riley wanted to 'get rid of the class system. I would stop fools going to college who are unworthy, they should go to apprentices.' Ruth Eker thought that the issues at the moment were in the housing market, and she would improve this sector. 'Life could be made easier for younger people and families getting on the housing ladder. Generally I wish society was kinder.' Scott Houghton thought the solution was to 'ban the Tories. As you can see round here they have screwed everything up.' Whereas Aisha Walker, 20 would 'stop letting people out of prison and make everything free, all the pools and playareas because people can't afford to take their kids swimming.' Perhaps most concerning Martim Martins, 18, wants to have an annual 'purge'.", "summary": "But what would you do if you were in the hotseat for a day?

This is contained in a statement jointly signed by the Chairman and Secretary of Council, Osadebamwen Osaretin and Ochiaka Ugwu, on Wednesday in Abuja. According to the union officials, the council is appalled by the outright disregard of members of the fourth estate of the realm by Umahi. \u201cThe description of over 40 journalists present for an assignment, as \u201cjournalists are not present\u201d was very condescending to a news conference he had invited the media through the ministry\u2019s Assistant Director Press, Mr Clement Ezeorah. \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, over 40 media correspondents were present for the news conference for which the ministry\u2019s invitation had been scheduled for 2pm and for which the minister came at 2:48pm. \u201cThe correspondents who were present include those from The Punch, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Nigerian Tribune, The Vanguard, Leadership, Daily Independent, People's Daily, Armed Forces Radio, NTA, Arise Television, TVC, amongst others. \u201cDescribing these and others as \u201cmedia not present\u201d leaves much to be desired. \u201cThe council urges President Tinubu to call the minister to order as well as direct all his appointees to demonstrate the highest civility and courtesy to journalists and the media in general,\u201d they said. They stressed that the minister owes a duty to Nigerians through the media and therefore, should demonstrate respect and utmost courtesy. They added that, if not, the media would be persuaded to boycott his activities,\u201d they said. According to them, treating members of the media with such condescension is unbecoming of a minister appointed to serve and not be an emperor. \u201cThe last time was him, trying to shout down the Arise TV Correspondent, Laila Johnson-Salami. \u201cIt should be noted that the media has a constitutional role to hold the government and its officials accountable to the Nigerian people. \u201dAnd therefore, no amount of intemperance from any government official will erode this sacred duty,\u201d they stressed.", "summary": "<img width=\"2048\" height=\"1366\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/F07xflHX0AAJCM2.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/F07xflHX0AAJCM2.jpg 2048w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/F07xflHX0AAJCM2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/F07xflHX0AAJCM2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/F07xflHX0AAJCM2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /><p>The Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, Federal Capital Territory Council has asked President Bola Tinubu to call the Minister of Works and Housing, David Umahi to order over his walkout on Journalists.

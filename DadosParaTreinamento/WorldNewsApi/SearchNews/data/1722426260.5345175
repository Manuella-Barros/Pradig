France is paying vintners to turn the fruit of their labor into ethanol for perfume and rubbing alcohol. These are just two symptoms of a worldwide wine glut. Globally, consumption was down 7% in 2023 from its peak in 2017. Young people are cutting back on alcohol consumption, while people who still enjoy a drink are turning to higher quality wines.

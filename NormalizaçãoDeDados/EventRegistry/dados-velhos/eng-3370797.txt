one of the communities at Alavanyo, complaining of stomach upset.\n\nThe latest death occurred on Wednesday, after four family members from Gbefi were also rushed to the hospital, with one pronounced dead upon arrival.\n\nThe incident has since left residents of the affected communities in fear and distress.\n\nThe administrator of the Margaret Marquart Hospital, Hanson Torde, who confirmed the incident, claimed that preliminary investigations into the case revealed that the victims had suffered from food poisoning, which could be caused by the consumption of the said fish.\n\nHe said the hospital authorities had contacted the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) about the matter, while a sample of the said poisonous fish had been handed over to the police to conduct thorough investigations into the incident.\n\nMr. Torde added that the bodies of the deceased were to be sent to either the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital or 37 Military Hospital in Accra for a post-mortem to be conducted on them to ascertain the actual cause of death.\n\nFDA Volta Regional Director, Eugene Addo, in an interview, said that his office received the sad news and that personnel had been sent to the affected communities.\n\nHe said the Authority currently has a sample of the smoked fish, but would speak to the families of the affected persons to ascertain the source of the fish to enable them carry out thorough investigations into the matter.", "eventUri": "eng-3370797", "timeCrawl": "11:16:00", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T11:16:00Z"}

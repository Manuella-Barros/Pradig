Video of the humiliating attack on Aliyah Konton, 15, at Mashpee High School on Cape Cod went viral on Snapchat after a friend of the bully filmed it and posted it. Konton had just recently moved to Mashpee and was trying to fit in, a classmate told WCVB. Police were alerted to the video after a school resource officer spotted it on May 25 \u2014 but no one told parents about the incident until Konton vanished on June 2, eight days later, the Daily Mail reported. The video starts with Konton standing in a school hallway as her 13-year-old attacker faces her and a mob of students watch. The bully then slaps Konton before she\u2019s led away by another student. The video then cuts to the school bathroom, where the alleged attacker is seen walking in as she drags a screaming Konton by her hair behind her. Konton starts crying as she\u2019s thrown by her hair near the bathroom stalls and is punched numerous times by the bully. The teen is seen putting an arm up to deflect the blows but otherwise does not fight back. The bully then points to the floor near a garbage can. \u201cLick the ground,\u201d she orders, slapping her again when Konton hesitates, before again dragging her by her hair and forcing her face to the floor. Police began searching for Konton eight days later when it was discovered she had disappeared from her Mashpee home \u2014 and parents finally learned about the vicious attack and how it had circulated in social media video. \u201cIt\u2019s awful to find out about this horrific incident on Facebook a week later, and not from the school itself,\u2019 Jessica Valois wrote under the department\u2019s post about the then-missing teen. \u201cWhy has the Mashpee school system not informed us of this situation?\u201d Corinne Shea seethed. Residents of the small town organized small search parties. Konton was eventually spotted in nearby Barnstable last Wednesday and came home. Classmate Leah Holtz said that Konton had only recently joined the school. \u201cShe just seems like she was trying to fit in and just trying to make friends with everybody,\u201d she told WCVB. An unidentified 13-year-old girl is now facing seven counts of assault and battery in Falmouth District Court\u2019s juvenile division. An investigation into \u201cpotential accomplices\u201d is ongoing, cops said Wednesday.", "summary": "Police were alerted to the video on May 25 \u2014 but no one told parents about the incident until Konton vanished on June 2, eight days later.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/cape-cod-hs-bully-13-beats-new-girl-15-who-vanished-for-days/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/mashpee-massachusetts-police-looking-aliyah-83464461.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/lssoT4gM-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:17:46", "author": "Dana Kennedy", "authors": ["Dana Kennedy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.426}

It\u2019s one of the most dreaded and difficult questions to answer. Just short of describing your \u201cbiggest weaknesses,\u201d a question that leaves you stumbling through an explanation of how you work \u201ctoo hard\u201d or you\u2019re too organized.\u201d It\u2019s hard if you\u2019re a new graduate, without much to draw on, and even harder when looking back on a bunch of smaller accomplishments that might not even be work-related.

How To Answer This Question Before discussing how to answer, here are a few ways you might not want to go about it. Even if you\u2019re the greatest problem-solver to ever walk through the swinging office doors at your last organization, do not use this as an opportunity to belittle or demean your former coworkers or organization. If you did solve big problems, describe your accomplishments, but leave any negativity behind. Don\u2019t share something you can\u2019t back up. If you share that you landed a big client for the firm but then struggled to answer any follow-up questions, this will confuse (at minimum). Worst-case scenario, it will look like you\u2019re lying. Don\u2019t attempt to be funny, silly or cute. Take the question seriously and answer it professionally. Don\u2019t talk down someone else in an attempt to make yourself look better and keep your story positive; overcoming an instance in which you were a victim isn\u2019t a situation the interviewer wants to hear about. To answer this question effectively, you should select an example of an accomplishment that demonstrates your capabilities, your ability to overcome challenges and your dedication to your work. Before getting to the interview, be ready with a few great achievement stories.

Be Specific: This question can be particularly difficult to answer to answer when it\u2019s the first one \u2013 and you haven\u2019t quite shaken off your nerves. You might be tempted to blurt out an answer and get over with. But this can be avoided by preparing answers beforehand. When you choose your top moment, make sure to have two or three reasons as to why it was such an amazing feat. Lay it all out \u2013 step by step.

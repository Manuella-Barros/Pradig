It (Rajiv Gandhi government's) was a decision which gave primacy to Sharia over the Constitution. The prestige of the Constitution which was crushed during the Congress government has been restored by this order. The verdict has ended one of the big threats posed to the Constitution,\" he told a press conference while replying to a question.\n\nIn what is popularly known as the Shah Bano case, the Supreme Court in 1985 had allowed her plea for alimony from her husband after she was divorced. However, the then Congress government passed a law in Parliament to overrule the verdict following protests from conservative Muslim groups.\n\nAlso Read | Delhi: Doctors Remove Giant 32cm Abdominal Tumour Bigger Than a Football Weighing 7.5 Kg.\n\nThe Supreme Court has now granted a big relief to Muslim women, Trivedi said, adding that it should be seen beyond a matter of religion as it is an issue of equal rights.\n\nThere is no secular state where Sharia provisions like halala, triple talaq and Haj subsidy were allowed and the then government by enacting a law had turned India into a partial Islamic state, he claimed.\n\nIn a judgment of far-reaching implications, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that a Muslim woman can seek maintenance from her husband under Section 125 of the CrPC and said the \"religion neutral\" provision is applicable to all married women irrespective of their religion.\n\nThe Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 will not prevail over the secular law, a bench of justices B V Nagarathna and Augustine George Masih said while stressing that maintenance is not charity but the right of all married women.\n\nAt the presser, Trivedi said Russia's highest state award, Order of St Andrew the Apostle, being conferred on Prime Minister Narendra Modi by Russian President Vladimir Putin is a matter of pride and satisfaction.\n\nLauding Modi's leadership and global standing, he said many countries, including France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have bestowed their highest honour on him. He has addressed the joint sitting of the US Congress twice, the BJP leader noted, adding that the US has reiterated that India is a strategic ally while Russia has honoured him with its highest award.\n\nNo leader of a country enjoys a position like him, Trivedi said.\n\nTaking a swipe at opposition parties, who have questioned Modi over foreign issues, including the Ukraine war, he said they have the habit of casting doubts on every auspicious occasion.\n\nSlamming the Congress, he said the party had passed a resolution at its CWC meeting in support of Palestine after conflict broke out between Israel and militant group Hamas.\n\n\"I want to ask the Congress whether any resolution on the Russia-Ukraine issue. On how many international issues, has the CWC (Congress Working Committee) passed any resolution,\" he said, adding that the opposition party should not engage in petty selfish politics over foreign issues.\n\nTo a question about rising population, he said it is a serious matter and all parties should consider it rising above partisan lines.\n\nDemographic changes are a challenge to some and an opportunity to some others, he said in a swipe at the Congress, noting that the biggest margin in the Lok Sabha poll was in Assam's Dhubri where its candidate Rakibul Hussain won by over 10 lakh votes.\n\nIn reference to the view, supported by the BJP, that the region has seen a large influx of infiltrators from Bangladesh over the decades, Trivedi said people should ponder over the shift of support to the main opposition party from the preceding MP Badruddin Ajmal, who he alleged was considered supportive to the infiltrators.\n\nAsked about the terror-related incidents in Jammu and Kashmir and the opposition's criticism of the BJP, he said the government is acting strongly. Terror incidents were taking place across the country before the Modi government came, he said, and cited high polling percentage and tourists' influx to the Valley to assert that change has taken place.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi_ministry", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi ministry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sharia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alimony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alimony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament,_Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudhanshu_Trivedi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sudhanshu Trivedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohd._Ahmed_Khan_v._Shah_Bano_Begum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohd.

Addressing a presser at the BJP's national headquarters in New Delhi, party spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said the verdict had \"ended\" a threat to the Constitution by the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, passed by a Congress government in the past.\n\n\"Whenever the Congress has been in power, the Constitution was under threat. It was under the Rajiv Gandhi government that a decision was taken which gave primacy to Sharia over the Constitution. The prestige of the Constitution which was crushed during the Congress government has been restored by this order. The verdict has ended one of the big threats posed to the Constitution,\" said Mr. Trivedi.\n\nSC examines divorced Muslim women's right to maintenance under Section 125 of the CrPC | Explained\n\nIn what is popularly known as the Shah Bano case, the Supreme Court in 1985 had allowed her plea for alimony from her husband after she was divorced. However, the then Congress government passed a law in Parliament to overrule the verdict following protests from conservative Muslim groups.\n\nMr. Trivedi said the Supreme Court's verdict should be seen in the light of restoration of equal rights rather than of religion.\n\nEditorial | Rebooting the codes: On the IPC, CrPC and Evidence Act\n\n\"There is no secular state where Sharia provisions like halala, triple talaq and Haj subsidy were allowed and the then government by enacting a law had turned India into a partial Islamic state,\" he claimed.\n\nIn a judgment of far-reaching implications, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that a Muslim woman can seek maintenance from her husband under Section 125 of the CrPC and said the \"religion neutral\" provision is applicable to all married women irrespective of their religion.\n\n'Not charity'\n\nThe Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 will not prevail over the secular law, a Bench of Justices B.V. Nagarathna and Augustine George Masih said, while stressing that maintenance is not charity but the right of all married women.\n\nMr. Trivedi also lauded the fact that Russia's highest state award, Order of St Andrew the Apostle, was conferred on Prime Minister Narendra Modi by Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit to Russia.\n\nTaking a swipe at the Opposition parties, who have questioned Mr. Modi over foreign issues, including the Ukraine war, he said they had the habit of casting doubts on every auspicious occasion.\n\nSlamming the Congress, he said the party had passed a resolution at its CWC meeting in support of Palestine after conflict broke out between Israel and militant group Hamas.\n\n\"I want to ask the Congress whether any resolution was passed on the Russia-Ukraine issue. On how many international issues, has the CWC [Congress Working Committee] passed any resolution,\" he said, adding that the opposition party should not engage in petty selfish politics over foreign issues.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Criminal_Procedure_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Code of Criminal Procedure (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudhanshu_Trivedi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sudhanshu Trivedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sharia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_talaq_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple talaq in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haj_subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haj subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohd._Ahmed_Khan_v._Shah_Bano_Begum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohd.

He noted that many countries, including France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, have conferred their highest honors on Modi, showcasing his global leadership and standing.\n\nTaking a jab at opposition parties, Trivedi criticized their habit of questioning Modi on foreign issues, including the Ukraine war. He pointed out that the Congress had passed a resolution in support of Palestine during the Israel-Hamas conflict but questioned whether they had addressed the Russia-Ukraine issue similarly.\n\nAddressing concerns about rising population, Trivedi called for all political parties to address the issue beyond partisan lines, pointing out the demographic changes and their implications. He cited Assam's Dhubri constituency as an example of shifting political support and emphasized the need for careful consideration of these changes.\n\nRegarding terror-related incidents in Jammu and Kashmir, Trivedi assured that the government is acting strongly.

The then Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, father of current CJI DY Chandrachud, had said: \"Section 125 was enacted in order to provide a quick and summary remedy to a class of persons who are unable to maintain themselves.What difference would it then make as to what is the religion professed by the neglected wife, child or parent?\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a Supreme Court bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Augustine George Masih reinforced the religion neutrality of Section 125 and said: \"The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 will not prevail over the secular and religion neutral provision of Section 125 of CrPC. We are hereby dismissing the criminal appeal with the major conclusion that Section 125 would be applicable to all women.\"\n\nThe ruling came on a petition by one Mohammed Abdul Samad, who had approached the top court to challenge a Telangana high court order which had refused to interfere with the maintenance order of a family court. The family court had ordered Samad to pay interim maintenance of Rs 20,000 to his estranged wife. Samad went to high court and contended that they got divorced in accordance with personal laws in 2017 and there was a divorce certificate to that effect. However, the high court did not change the family court order. It only reduced the maintenance amount from Rs 20,000 to Rs 10,000 per month.\n\nThe top court in its order reiterated what was said by a five-judge Supreme Court bench in the Shah Bano case.\n\nWhat was the Shah Bano case?\n\nShah Bano, a 62-year-old Muslim woman, had in April 1978 filed a petition in court demanding maintenance from her divorced husband Mohammed Ahmad Khan, who was a lawyer in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. The two were married in 1932 and had five children -- three sons and two daughters. Shah Bano was driven out of her matrimonial home in 1975, after a prolonged period of her living with Ahmad Khan and his second wife. Shah Bano went to court and filed a claim for monthly maintenance of Rs 500 for herself and her five children under Section 123 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. However, Khan contested the claim on the grounds that the Muslim Personal Law in India required the husband to only provide maintenance for the iddat period after divorce.\n\nIn August 1979, the magistrate awarded her maintenance of Rs 20 per month. On her appeal, the Madhya Pradesh HC enhanced it to Rs 179. Khan challenged HC verdict before the SC. A five-judge SC bench led by then CJI Y V Chandrachud in April 1985 upheld the maintenance granted by the HC with a direction to the husband to pay an additional sum of Rs 10,000 as cost to Bano.\n\nSo, what changed after the Shah Bano judgment?\n\nThe impact of the SC judgment in the Shah Bano case was diluted by the enactment of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, by the then Congress government led by Rajiv Gandhi. The 1986 Act stated that the Muslim woman can seek maintenance only during iddat -- 90 days after the divorce.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the 1986 Act in 2001, but extended the right of Muslim woman to get maintenance till she re-marries. The Court ruled that Muslim husbands are liable to provide maintenance to their divorced wives beyond the iddat period till she re-marries.\n\nBJP welcomes SC verdict, takes digs at Congress\n\nThe BJP welcomed the Supreme Court verdict and was quick to remind the Congress how the grand old party had in the past reversed a similar apex court order in the Shah Bano case. BJP spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Sudhanshu Trivedi took digs the Congress as he linked the verdict to the claims of grand old party on protecting the Constitution.\n\n\"Rajiv Gandhi government's decision to enact a law to overrule an apex court judgment granting alimony to divorced Muslim women was one of the biggest threats to the Constitution as it gave primacy to Sharia, Islamic laws,\" Sudhanshu Trivedi said.\n\n\"Whenever the Congress has been in power, the Constitution was under threat. It (Rajiv Gandhi government's) was a decision which gave primacy to Sharia over the Constitution. The prestige of the Constitution which was crushed during the Congress government has been restored by this order. The verdict has ended one of the big threats posed to the Constitution,\" the BJP leader said.\n\n\"There is no secular state where Sharia provisions like halala, triple talaq and Haj subsidy were allowed and the then government by enacting a law had turned India into a partial Islamic state,\" he claimed.\n\nThe UCC debate\n\nThe SC verdict will once again put the focus back on the debate around Uniform Civil Code - which remains one of unfulfilled promises of the BJP. The BJP in its 2024 Lok Sabha election manifesto had pledged to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) across the country after forming a government at the Centre.\n\nThe saffron party claimed that Article 44 of the Constitution lists the Uniform Civil Code as one of the Directive Principles of State Policy. \"The party reiterates its stand to draw a Uniform Civil Code, drawing upon the best traditions and harmonising them with the modern times,\" it said in the manifesto.\n\nHowever, the road ahead for the BJP on this promise may not be easy as the saffron party is now dependent on allies for the survival of NDA 3. Telugu Desam Party chief Chandrababu Naidu, whose support is crucial for Modi government, openly backs the idea of reservations to Muslims, which the BJP strongly opposes.\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Following the landmark verdict by the country's highest court, triple talaq crusader Shayara Bano expressed satisfaction that it will bring benefits to divorced Muslim women. Bano serves as the Vice-Chairperson of the Uttarakhand State Women's Commission and herself has experienced the repercussions of triple talaq.\n\nIn 2016, Bano approached the Supreme Court to challenge the practice, a struggle that resulted in a favourable verdict in 2017. Subsequently, in 2018, the country enacted legislation outlawing triple talaq, enabling legal action against those who pronounce it, including imprisonment. SC on Muslim Women's Right to Maintenance: 'Muslim Woman Entitled To Seek Maintenance After Divorce Under Section 125 of CrPC', Says Supreme Court.\n\nIn an interview with IANS, Bano emphasised that the Supreme Court's verdict is beneficial for all Muslim women. She highlighted that this decision will positively impact their financial stability and reduce instances of arbitrary triple talaq, thereby elevating the social standing of Muslim women.\n\nBano recalled how her husband divorced her abruptly through a speed post without any justification. He worked as a property dealer while she was a homemaker. Throughout her ordeal, she found support from her relatives. She courageously filed a petition against triple talaq in the Supreme Court, ultimately achieving justice. With the enactment of laws prohibiting triple talaq, Muslim women are now empowered to seek legal recourse for themselves. Counterfeit Currency Case: Supreme Court Rebukes NIA for Four-Year Delay in Trial Resulting in Accused Languishing in Jail, Says 'Please Do Not Make a Mockery of Justice'.\n\nFollowing the implementation of the triple talaq law, Bano was appointed as the Vice-Chairperson of the Uttarakhand State Women's Commission, where she remains dedicated to advancing women's rights and empowerment. She has been actively advocating for the rights and dignity of women who have been victimised.\n\nBano mentioned that in cases of women facing oppression, she endeavours to facilitate dialogue between both parties to foster mutual understanding. Local women have also expressed their satisfaction with the Supreme Court's decision, noting that it is likely to reduce occurrences of triple talaq. Previously, it had become somewhat commonplace for men to initiate divorces following extramarital affairs, trivialising the process. However, following the court's ruling, there is optimism within the Muslim community that such instances will decline.\n\nAnother woman emphasised that post-divorce, husbands should be obligated to provide financial support to their wives, considering women are responsible not just for their own expenses but also for their children's welfare. This measure, she believes, would alleviate some of the financial burdens on women and potentially reduce divorce rates.\n\nImportantly, the Supreme Court has clarified that the law regarding maintenance applies to all married women, regardless of their religious affiliation. Section 125 stipulates that individuals with sufficient means cannot evade their responsibility to provide maintenance to their wives, children, or parents.\n\nThe court emphasised that maintenance is not an act of charity but a fundamental right of married women.

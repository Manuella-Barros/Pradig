The duo will also be the first humans to fly on board the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket.\n\nRelated: I flew Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in 4 different simulators. Here's what I learned (video, photos)\n\nBoeing and SpaceX received contracts from NASA in 2014 for commercial crew missions to the ISS. Previous to commercial crew, NASA's space shuttle regularly exchanged ISS crews until the program's retirement in 2011 after 30 years of missions.\n\nBoeing's commercial crew contract for the Starliner is valued at $4.2 billion, compared to SpaceX's $2.6 billion. SpaceX has been running operational ISS missions with Crew Dragon since 2020, while Starliner was delayed four years.\n\nEngineers uncovered and addressed numerous technical problems with Starliner, particularly after the first uncrewed test flight in 2019 that failed to reach the ISS as planned. (A second flight got there safely in 2022.)\n\nMore issues were found in 2023, further pushing back human spaceflight: The suspension lines of Starliner's main parachutes could handle less load than engineers thought, for example, and the capsule's wiring was largely covered in flammable P213 tape.\n\nDuring a two-day media tour at JSC in March that Space.com attended, the crew, NASA and Boeing officials emphasized that the delays were necessary for safety. Moreover, the team has confidence that everything is ready for astronauts. Should issues come up in flight, which is common on new spacecraft, Starliner will be in good hands: Williams and Wilmore are former U.S. Navy test pilots well-versed in working out the kinks.\n\nRelated: 1st Boeing Starliner astronauts are ready to launch to the ISS for NASA (exclusive)\n\nNASA's commercial crew program gave CFT its \"go for launch\" on April 18, following a flight test readiness review, officials wrote on X (formerly Twitter). Another review is scheduled on April 25, which is also the day that the astronauts are scheduled to fly to KSC for launch preparation.\n\nMeanwhile, Starliner made a six-mile (10-kilometer) journey between KSC buildings on April 16 to reach ULA's vertical integration facility, where it was integrated onto its Atlas V rocket. Engineers are testing the communications between the rocket and spacecraft before the stacked rocket rolls out to its KSC launch pad.\n\nThe first operational mission for Starliner, known as Starliner-1, is set for early 2025 at the earliest. The crew for that mission is NASA's Scott Tingle, NASA's Mike Fincke and the Canadian Space Agency's Joshua Kutryk.\n\nSpaceX and Boeing aren't the only entities sending astronauts to the ISS, as Russia's Soyuz spacecraft has been doing that since the complex began construction in 1998. Some NASA astronauts fly on Soyuz for technical and policy reasons, too.\n\nNASA has several quarantine facilities available for astronauts and their support teams. JSC's NASA Astronaut Quarantine Facility is a 12,000-square-foot complex with 12 private sleeping quarters, alongside restrooms, a fitness room and a full kitchen, according to general contractor Harvey Cleary.\n\nKSC's Astronaut Crew Quarters is roughly 26,000 square feet in size and is on the third floor of the Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building, where spacecraft are tested and assembled.

It became a launch-day tradition.\n\nBut for the first Starliner launch with a crew onboard, the Boeing project engineer who will say goodbye to the two astronauts said he wants something more personal.\n\n\"I'm kissing them on the forehead,\" said Armando Loli, senior project engineer of Boeing's Tech 5 Launch Pad Team.\n\nThe journey for the Boeing Starliner to get to this point has been a long one and for at least two Boeing engineers, that's meant a lot more time getting to know Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, the two astronauts who will fly Starliner on its first crewed mission next month. Everything about this mission has become much more personal.\n\n\"It's like graduation day, or the birth of your child. It's one of those huge life events that you've been preparing for for so long. There aren't any words to even describe it,\" said Dee Dobson, a systems engineering technician at Boeing.\n\nLoli and Dobson spoke to FLORIDA TODAY as the Starliner made its middle-of-the-night rollout Tuesday to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Launch Complex 41. Launch of the Starliner on its first Crew Flight Test is scheduled for 10:34 p.m. May 6 to send Wilmore and Williams to the International Space Station.\n\nDon't miss the next launch: Is there a launch today? Upcoming rocket launch schedule for SpaceX, ULA, NASA in Florida\n\nThe day the Starliner spacecraft was finally mated to the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket for the crew flight test was a long time coming for the team at Boeing. NASA originally awarded Boeing the contract to fly astronauts in 2014, along with SpaceX.\n\nThe two companies were selected as part of the commercial crew program simultaneously, with Boeing receiving $4.8 billion for Starliner while SpaceX received $3.1 billion for Dragon.\n\nBut SpaceX has been flying astronauts with their Dragon since 2020. Following the successful flight of this Starliner crewed flight test, the Boeing Starliner will be certified to fly NASA crews in rotation with SpaceX. Starliner has previously flown two uncrewed missions, and while the first mission in 2019 failed to reach the ISS, the second mission in 2022 did, successfully docking and undocking with the station. However, that last flight did not come without issues, leading to Starliner waiting two years to see another flight.\n\nLoli has been with Boeing through every flight of Starliner. Over the past six years, he has seen it all, from Starliner's primary structure taking shape all the way to next month's planned crewed mission. He worked in industrial engineering beginning with OFT-1 (Orbital Flight Test-1), but now his job for this flight also includes working on the launch pad team.\n\n\"We're finally there,\" Loli said as he recalled how far the team has come over the years. \"It's a mix of emotion. We were talking today about the first roll out (of Starliner) we saw, and it was like 'wow, this is crazy. We've seen the first vehicle rolling out and now we see CFT (Crew Flight Test) with Butch and Suni there. Wow, finally, they're going to launch into space'\".\n\n\"I get to strap in Suni and Butch prior to the launch,\" Loli said, referring to his job as the crew who will be the last to physically be with the astronauts before they head into space. \"I've been interacting with them for years.\"\n\nLoli said he has been planning his send off for awhile. \"I asked them 'hey, when you guys launched shuttle back in the day, what was your tradition with the closeout team?'. It was, you know, 'high-five'. I said, 'I'm not doing that',\" Loli said as he mused about his planned send-off. \"I'm kissing them on the forehead.\"\n\nWhile the liftoff will be exciting, Loli said true satisfaction will come when they see Williams and Wilmore come back safely from this milestone flight.\n\nBecause they will be interacting with Williams and Wilmore before their journey, Loli and the rest of the closeout team also will quarantining with them. Astronauts flying to the space station must quarantine during the two weeks preceding flight to ensure they are healthy on launch day and beyond. The Starliner crew were slated to begin their quarantine Monday, April 22, in preparation for the May 6 launch.\n\nFor Dobson, her work will involve not only liftoff but also the crew's return. During the Crew Flight Test, she will be working as the project lead for the camera system inside the spacecraft, which is referred to as 'Mustang'. Dobson will also be serving on the landing and recovery team.\n\nAs time races on towards launch day, Dobson is working with crew on testing the camea system and packing the cargo bags.\n\n\"This is one leg of a very long journey,\" Dobson said as she reflected on how far the Boeing team has come. Dobson told FLORIDA TODAY that she has known Williams since she was assigned to the Starliner Crew Flight Test in 2022.\n\nAnd she sees a positive in the long wait to get to the crewed launch.\n\n\"That's one of the things about Starliner having been delayed, this crew has a lot more training time on this vehicle and we all got to spend a lot more time with them,\" said Dobson. \"They are just as much a part of the family as anybody that works on the vehicle, or anyone that has anything to do with the vehicle.\"\n\nWhen the crew returns to Earth with a planned \"soft landing\" in the New Mexico desert, Dobson will be there to greet them. \"We're all going to be out in the desert waiting for them, looking for them with binoculars...staring up at the sky,\" she told FLORIDA TODAY.\n\nDobson briefly explained the team's activities on day the crew comes home. Unlike SpaceX's Dragon, which splashes down in the ocean, Starliner will land under three parachutes, deploying airbags to slow the landing.\n\n\"There's a lot that happens when they first land down. We make sure the vehicle is safe to approach and be around. There's voice communication between the crew and the ground teams making sure everybody's OK and that everything is alright inside the vehicle,\" said Dobson. \"Then we go and get them out.\"\n\n\"It's going to be really emotional to see them. It will be a final 'oh my gosh. We made it. There it is: the mission completion,\" she said. \"I'm going to say 'welcome home. How was your trip? Did you have fun?'\"\n\n\"We've known Butch and Suni for over six years. I remember when we first started we were both like 'wow, that's an astronaut',\" said Loli.\n\n\"As time progressed, we're like 'Oh, it's Suni and Butch. They're probably going to make us do something, so let's go hide.',\" he joked.\n\nLoli smiled as he told FLORIDA TODAY how he considers both astronauts good friends.\n\nDobson nodded. \"Sometimes the missions are long. Sometimes the missions are short. Sometimes it's a sprint to get there. Sometimes it's a marathon. Ours has been a marathon,\" said Dobson. \"We know Butch and Suni. It's not just us sending this vehicle we've all been working on for so many years. We're sending our friends into space.\"\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today.

Aside from being the first humans to fly on Starliner, the duo will also be the first astronauts on board the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket.\n\nYou can watch the crew's arrival at KSC starting at 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT) in the video just above, courtesy of NASA TV.\n\nWilmore and Williams, both veteran NASA astronauts and former U.S. Navy test pilots, will be tasked with testing Starliner during this first crewed launch to the International Space Station. Their Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission will be roughly a week long with the goal of certifying Starliner for future space station rotation missions that will last about six months each.\n\nRelated: I flew Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in 4 different simulators. Here's what I learned (video, photos)\n\nBoeing, alongside SpaceX, was tasked by NASA in 2014 to send commercial crew missions to the ISS. (NASA used to ferry most of its astronauts there using the space shuttle, and temporarily pivoted fully to using Russia's Soyuz spacecraft between the shuttle's retirement in 2011 and SpaceX's first crewed mission in 2020.)\n\nBoeing's commercial crew contract for Starliner is valued at $4.2 billion, compared to SpaceX's $2.6 billion. But while SpaceX has sent 11 crews to the ISS aboard Crew Dragon, Starliner was delayed by four years amid numerous technical problems.\n\nStarliner's first uncrewed flight to the ISS in 2019 failed to reach its destination. After implementing dozens of fixes, Starliner's second ISS flight (also without astronauts) made it there and back in 2022. The first crewed spaceflight for Starliner got delayed in 2023 after more issues were found with the spacecraft, with its main parachutes (the suspension lines carried less load than engineers thought) and wiring (largely covered with flammable P213 tape).\n\nMission representatives as well as the astronauts themselves told reporters last month, during media activities at NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, that these issues have been solved ahead of CFT's launch.\n\nRelated: 1st Boeing Starliner astronauts are ready to launch to the ISS for NASA (exclusive)\n\nThe crew entered quarantine on Tuesday (April 23) at JSC, roughly a week after visiting KSC, to see Starliner make a six-mile (10-kilometer) journey between buildings before getting integrated with the Atlas V. Engineers are testing communications between the rocket and spacecraft before the stacked rocket rolls out to its KSC launch pad.\n\nA flight readiness review is ongoing this week by NASA and Boeing officials, and a press conference is expected later today around 6 p.m. EDT (2200 GMT) that will also run here live on Space.com. NASA's commercial crew program gave CFT its \"go for launch\" on April 18, following a flight test readiness review, officials wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nIf CFT's flight goes to plan, the first operational mission (Starliner-1) is set to fly in early 2025 at the earliest. On board Starliner-1 will be NASA's Scott Tingle, NASA's Mike Fincke and the Canadian Space Agency's Joshua Kutryk. If successful, Boeing will then join SpaceX and Russia, which flies some NASA astronauts to the ISS for technical and policy reasons, in delivering regular space station crews for normal half-year rotations.", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johnson Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Kutryk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Kutryk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fincke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fincke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_D._Tingle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott D.

The astronauts' family and launch team members may also be in quarantine or they could be cleared before meeting the crew.\n\nLaunch details\n\nThe Atlas V rocket will take off with the two astronauts at 8:04 am IST on May 7 from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. Meanwhile, teams are preparing for the Flight Test Readiness Review, which will take place on April 24 and 25.\n\nNASA is working closely with Boeing as the former wants to avail Starliner's services for cargo and crew transportation.

She had then docked with the International Space Station on December 11, 2006.\n\nWilliams had served as a flight engineer in the Expedition 14 crew. While onboard, she established a world record for females with four spacewalks totalling 29 hours and 17 minutes, NASA said. Astronaut Peggy Whitson subsequently broke the record in 2008 with a total of five spacewalks.\n\nWilliams concluded her tour of duty as a member of the Expedition 15 crew. She returned to Earth with the STS-117 crew on June 22, 2007.\n\n2. Expedition 32/33 (July 14 to November 18, 2012): Sunita Williams launched on July 14, 2012, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, along with Russian Soyuz commander Yuri Malenchenko and Flight Engineer Akihiko Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency,.\n\nWilliams had spent four months conducting research and exploration aboard the orbiting laboratory. During their Expedition, Williams and Hoshide performed three spacewalks to replace a component that relays power from the space station's solar arrays to its systems and repair an ammonia leak on a station radiator.\n\n\"With 50 hours and 40 minutes, Williams once again held the record for total cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut (has since been overtaken by Peggy Whitson with 10 spacewalks). Williams has spent a cumulative total of 322 days in space,\" NASA said.\n\nNASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will lift off aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket and dock at the orbiting laboratory, where they will stay for about a week.\n\nThe mission is the first crewed flight for the Starliner spacecraft.\n\nThe mission will test the end-to-end capabilities of the Starliner system, including launch, docking, and return to Earth in the western United States.\n\n\"Following a successful crewed flight test, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and systems for crewed missions to the space station,\" the US space agency added.\n\nMilestone Alert!

Their destination: the orbiting laboratory, where they will reside for approximately a week.\n\nThe upcoming mission forms a crucial component of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, marking the maiden crewed flight for the Starliner spacecraft. Its objectives encompass comprehensive testing of the spacecraft's functionalities, encompassing launch, docking manoeuvres, and safe return to Earth in the western United States. Following a successful crewed flight test, NASA will proceed with certifying Starliner and associated systems for future crewed missions to the space station.\n\nWilliams boasts an illustrious spacefaring career, having been selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1998. She has previously undertaken two space missions, namely Expeditions 14/15 and 32/33.\n\nDuring Expedition 14/15, spanning from December 2006 to June 2007, Williams served as the flight engineer. Notably, she established a world record for female astronauts by conducting four spacewalks, accumulating a total of 29 hours and 17 minutes outside the ISS. Williams also participated in Expedition 32/33, assuming the roles of flight engineer and ISS commander. This mission, launched in July 2012, involved a four-month tenure aboard the ISS, during which Williams and her crewmate Akihiko Hoshide from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) undertook three spacewalks to perform critical maintenance tasks.\n\nIn total, Williams has spent a remarkable 322 days in space across her two missions. Her cumulative spacewalk time of 50 hours and 40 minutes once held the record for female astronauts, subsequently surpassed by Astronaut Peggy Whitson.\n\nAs Williams prepares for her upcoming mission to the ISS, anticipation mounts within the scientific community for the invaluable contributions she and her fellow astronauts will make towards advancing human space exploration.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extravehicular activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Expedition 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_32", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Expedition 32"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAXA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JAXA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihiko_Hoshide", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akihiko Hoshide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Whitson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peggy Whitson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/04/Sunita-Williams-set-for-third-space-mission-will-join-NASAs-Boeing-Crew-Flight-Test-to-ISS-2024-04-1ef5e709793858dc069a3cb7734c21a3-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507638", "eventUri": "eng-9507638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2006-12-", "dateEnd": "2007-06-", "textStart": 1353, "textEnd": 1379}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 333, "textEnd": 338}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-07-", "textStart": 1710, "textEnd": 1719}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

With that, final checkouts are underway before two NASA astronauts climb inside and fly it to the ISS and back.\n\nAfter years of delays, Boeing will finally get its day in the headlines to launch its first crewed flight to the ISS on Starliner. As soon as May 7, the Boeing Crewed Flight Test is planned to lift off from SLC-41 on an Atlas V rocket with NASA astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams.\n\nLast week final preparations began with Boeing fueling Starliner with the propellent it needs for its attitude control thrusters and abort system. Similar to SpaceX's Dragon, Starliner uses hypergolic fuel for its systems. This fuel can be stored at room temperature so it can last the entire mission, however, it's extremely toxic to humans.\n\nFueling was completed mid-las week and so teams from both Boeing and ULA picked up Starliner and moved it to SLC-41 overnight. The move started at Boeing's facility at Kennedy Space Center, which was originally built as one of the few hangers for the Space Shuttles, and ended just outside SLC-41 at the Vertical Integration Facility.\n\nTheir Starliner was hoisted up and attached on top of the special Centaur upper stage. Unlike other Atlas V rockets, the second stage for Starliner's rocket will be powered by two RL-10 engines. While Vulcan's Centaur come standard with two engines, Atlas V's Centaurs usually fly with just one.\n\nThe unique trajectory required for human spaceflight and need for redundant options requires two engines on Starliner Atlas Vs. If you know Atlas Vs, you'll know each rocket has a number that denotes its variation. For Starliner mission, the Atlas V's variation is N22. N stands for \"no\" fairing, 2 for the number of solid rocket motors, and 2 for the number of engines on the second stage.\n\nJoin our Discord Server: Join the community with forums and chatrooms about space!\n\nAs with all test flights, the risks of something going wrong are always greater. The same things where said before SpaceX's first crewed test flight in 2020.\n\nThis will be Starliner's third test flight and first crewed. We of course remember Starliner's OFT-1 mission that nearly ended in disaster, a few times. However, OFT-2 came back with an overall successful mission, outside of a few items here and there that needed fixing. Early SpaceX Dragon missions had similar one offs that needed fixing.\n\nThe big delays came when late discoveries of less than capable parachute attachment points and flammable tape were found. This led to a long process of getting Calypso acceptable for launch and new parachute tests.\n\nWith all of that done, NASA has signed off on Starliner being safe and ready for its first crewed mission. While SpaceX DM-2 featured an extended multi-week mission with spacewalks, Starliner CFT will most likely be a short duration flight just to test out the spacecraft.\n\nIf all goes well, Starliner could get its first operational crew rotation next year and finally begin taking turns with SpaceX on shuttling astronauts to and from the station.\n\nBoeing has six missions under contract, between those and SpaceX's six, that brings us to one mission at the start of 2030 (the year the ISS is expected to be retired). If Boeing can launch its first operational mission at the beginning of 2025, then we wouldn't have reliance on just one provider for the rest of the station's lifespan, If not, and the first operational mission doesn't launch until fall of 2025, then Boeing would get the final two missions for the ISS.", "source": {"uri": "spaceexplored.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space Explored"}, "authors": [{"uri": "seth_kurkowski@spaceexplored.com", "name": "Seth Kurkowski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_attitude_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft attitude control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

Of course we want it to do that,\" said Wilmore from the tarmac. \"Do we expect it to go perfectly? This is the first human flight of the spacecraft. I'm sure we'll find things out. That's why we do this. This is a test flight. When you do test, you expect to find things. And we expect to find things.\"\n\nWilmore, who was part of NASA's 2000 astronaut class, was the pilot for STS-129 on board Space Shuttle Atlantis for an 11-day mission in 2009 and then stayed on board the ISS for nearly five months from 2014-2015. Williams was part of NASA's 1998 astronaut class and had two long-term stays on board the ISS, first flying in 2006 on Space Shuttle Discovery on STS-116 and flying home on Space Shuttle Atlantis on STS-117 in 2007 after 192 days in space. She then flew on a Soyuz in 2012 for a four-month stay on board.\n\nThis is the third trip to space for both, but the pair are not resting on their laurels with 11 days to go before launch with Wilmore saying the coming days could be summed up in three words.\n\n\"Review, review, and review -- everything we've been working on. There's so much into this, there's a fair amount of responsibility, obviously, that we hold,\" he said. \"We are ready. But we want to stay ready. We've got a week to continue to make sure that there's not a single event that we have prepared for that we're not ready for.\"\n\nThis marks only the sixth new U.S.-based spacecraft to carry humans following Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the space shuttle and the most recent entrant, SpaceX's Crew Dragon. Dragon's first human spaceflight came nearly four years ago launching May 30, 2020 with its own pair of veteran NASA astronauts, Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley.\n\nWilliams said she got a pep talk from Behnken.\n\n\"I just got a text from Bob last night, and he was pretty pumped that we were coming down here. He was like, 'I'm reliving it in my mind where we were.',\" she said. \"He gives us his best and is ready for us to go fly.\"\n\nSpaceX and Boeing had been running fairly close in development at the end of the last decade as one of two companies NASA awarded contracts for under its Commercial Crew Program. The goal of the program was to replace U.S.-based flights after the end of the Space Shuttle Program in 2011, which forced a reliance on Russia for flights to the ISS on board Soyuz spacecraft.\n\nStarliner, though, ran into trouble on its first uncrewed test flight in December 2019 that was not able to rendezvous with the ISS, forcing a major overhaul of Boeing's program including hardware, software and management changes. That led to the successful redo of that uncrewed test flight in 2022, but further hardware delays have now made it so next month's planned launch will come more than four years behind schedule.\n\nSince then, SpaceX has proceeded full bore having now flown 50 humans to space on board its fleet of four Crew Dragon spacecraft on 13 missions, and has three more on the schedule to fly before the end of the year.\n\nWilmore, though, said Starliner took longer, but it's time.\n\n\"We've had a few delays because we weren't ready,\" he said. \"There are literally 1,000 events that are taking place simultaneously, as you step up and get prepared to launch and during the launch sequence, and then the spacecraft itself when we're on orbit.\"\n\nBut he's adamant all the parts are in place.\n\n\"There's so much going on. It is not easy. I think we make it look easy. That's our goal,\" he said. \"We want the general public to think it's easy, but it's not. It's way hard. We wouldn't be here if we weren't ready. We are ready. The spacecraft's ready. And the teams are ready.\"\n\nBoeing's CFT mission now aims for about an eight-day stay on board the ISS with the major goals for its crew to test out both docking backup systems on approach and landing operations when it heads back to Earth, which will feature a parachute-assisted touchdown in the western U.S. unlike the watery splashdowns off the Florida coast taken by SpaceX's Crew Dragon.\n\nIf successful, it lines Boeing up to begin operational missions to the ISS as early as February 2025. That first mission dubbed Starliner-1 has three of its four crew members already named.\n\nBoeing is contracted for six crew rotation mission through the end of the ISS's operation as early as 2030. SpaceX and Boeing would transition to sharing one mission each per year for NASA until the ISS is decommissioned.\n\nFor her part, Williams pumped up Starliner's role in the NASA program now, as well as its role with NASA' future Artemis program missions on the Orion spacecraft.\n\n\"It has a lot of similar things that Orion has,\" she said. \"So I think if I was a young astronaut, and I was thinking about going to the moon, I think I'd put my hand up and say I want to fly Starliner.\"", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_tribou@orlandosentinel.com", "name": "Richard Tribou", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Atlantis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle Atlantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Space Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-129", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "STS-129"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_T-38_Talon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northrop T-38 Talon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-116", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "STS-116"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Behnken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Behnken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Hurley", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-117", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "STS-117"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tos-l-starliner-crew-arrival0393.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507638", "eventUri": "eng-9507638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 537, "textEnd": 542}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-30", "textStart": 2398, "textEnd": 2410}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 3202, "textEnd": 3215}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Following a successful crewed flight test, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and systems for crewed missions to the space station.\n\nWilliams' earlier missions\n\nSunita Williams was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1998 and is a veteran of two space missions -- Expeditions 14/15 and 32/33.\n\nExpedition 14/15 lasted from December 9, 2006 till June 22, 2007. As a member of the Expedition 14 crew, Williams served as the flight engineer. She concluded her tour of duty as a member of the Expedition 15 crew returning to Earth with the STS-117 crew to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California.\n\nWhile on board, Williams established a world record for female astronauts with four spacewalks, totaling 29 hours and 17 minutes. Her record was later broken by Astronaut Peggy Whitson in 2008 with a total of five spacewalks.\n\nWilliams was also part of a long-duration mission as flight engineer for Expedition 32 and International Space Station commander for Expedition 33.\n\nShe launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, along with Russian Soyuz commander Yuri Malenchenko and Flight Engineer Akihiko Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency on July 14, 2012. Williams spent four months conducting research and exploration aboard the orbiting laboratory. She landed in Kazakhstan on November 18, 2012, after spending 127 days in space. During their expedition, Williams and Hoshide performed three spacewalks to replace a component that relays power from the space station's solar arrays to its systems, and repair an ammonia leak on a station radiator.\n\nWilliams has spent a total of 322 days in space over the course of her two missions.\n\nWith 50 hours and 40 minutes, Williams once again held the record for total cumulative

Read on to know her story.\n\nNASA astronaut Sunita Lyn Williams has spent 321 days, 17 hours, and 15 minutes of her life in space and she is all set to embark on her third space mission soon. She is undergoing training as one of the first-ever pilots of the Crew Flight Test mission aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. NASA said in a statement that \"The mission is targeting launch at 10:34 p.m. EDT on Monday, May 6, from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\"\n\n'Suni' Williams and astronaut Butch Wilmore will lift off aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket and dock at the orbiting laboratory, where they will stay for about a week, the NASA statement read.\n\nSunita Lyn Williams will be heading to space for the third time in her life. The 58-year-old astronaut's first spaceflight experience was as a Flight Engineer with Expedition 14/15 from December 9, 2006, to June 22, 2007.\n\nIt was during that flight that Williams set new records for women in space with four spacewalks totalling 29 hours and 17 minutes. She concluded her tour and returned to Earth with the STS-117 crew.\n\nFollowing that, her next space lift was with Expedition 32/33 which launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in July 2012. She once again set a record for total cumulative spacewalk time with a time of 50 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nShe, Russian Soyuz commander Yuri Malenchenko, and Flight Engineer Akihiko Hoshide of Japan spent four months conducting research and exploration aboard the orbiting laboratory before landing in November 2012.\n\nWilliams belongs to Needham, Massachusetts. Her father, Deepak Pandya, was a renowned neuroanatomist from India. Her mother Ursuline Bonnie (Zalokar) Pandya is a Slovenian.\n\nSunita, commonly known as Suni, received a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Naval Academy, and then a Master of Science degree in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology in 1995.\n\nShe was an ensign in the United States Navy in May 1987 as a Basic Diving Officer. In 1989, she reported to the Naval Air Training Command, where she was designated a Naval Aviator.\n\nIn 1993, Williams began training at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. After her graduation, she was assigned to the Rotary Wing Aircraft Test Directorate as an H-46 Project Officer and V-22 chase pilot in the T-2.\n\nIn 1995, she went back to the Naval Test Pilot School as an instructor in the Rotary Wing Department and as the school's Safety Officer, where she flew the UH-60, OH-6, and OH-58 choppers.\n\nShe was then assigned as an Aircraft Handler and the Assistant Air Boss on the USS Saipan in 1998. Williams was selected by NASA for the astronaut program, where she began her training at Johnson Space Center in August 1998.\n\nWilliams has recorded more than 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 aircraft types. She has received several laurels for her contributions to the US Navy and American space research.\n\nSome of her awards include the Defense Superior Service Medal (which she won twice), the Legion of Merit, the Navy Commendation Medal twice, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, and the Humanitarian Service Medal.", "source": {"uri": "shethepeople.tv", "dataType": "news", "title":

Boeing repeated the demo in 2022. More recently, the capsule was plagued by parachute issues and flammable tape that had to be removed.\n\nWilmore stressed this is a test flight meant to uncover anything amiss.\n\n\"Do we expect it to go perfectly? This is the first human flight of the spacecraft,\" he told reporters. \"I'm sure we'll find things out.

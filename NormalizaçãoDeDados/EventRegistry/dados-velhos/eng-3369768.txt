The Democratic Senator says she didn't mean what she posted Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017, but was frustrated with the president's reaction to the violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Va.(\n\nBy Margaret Stafford, Associated Press\n\nThursday, Aug. 17, 2017 | 9:10 p.m.\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A Missouri lawmaker acknowledged Thursday that she posted and later deleted a comment on Facebook about hoping for President Donald Trump's assassination, saying she was frustrated with the president's response to the white supremacist rally and violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal said she was wrong for writing the post and didn't mean what she said, but she refused calls to resign. She said she wrote \"I hope Trump is assassinated!\" in response to a post that suggested Vice President Mike Pence would try to have Trump removed from office.\n\n\"What I wrote down on my private Facebook page, was it wrong? Absolutely,\" she told The Associated Press. \"But I am going to continue to talk about the anger and the frustration that led to that.\"\n\nThe post drew a swift rebuke, including calls from top Democrats for her resignation.\n\nAmong them were Missouri Senate Democratic Leader Gina Walsh, who condemned Chappelle-Nadal's post as \"horrible.\" The chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party, Stephen Webber, said the comments were \"indefensible\" and the party \"will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the president.\"\n\n\"I condemn it. It's outrageous,\" added Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, the state's senior senator. \"And she should resign.\"\n\nMissouri's Republican Gov. Eric Greitens and the state Republican party also called for her resignation, but Chappelle-Nadal said she had no intention of doing so.\n\n\"I refuse to resign for exercising my First Amendment rights, even though what I said was wrong,\" she said.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service released a statement saying it looks into all threats against the president, \"whether they be direct, implied, or comments in passing.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal, from the St. Louis suburb of University City, said constituents in her predominantly black district are concerned about how Trump blamed \"both sides\" of the clashes in Charlottesville. The violence included a man slamming his car into people protesting against the white supremacist rally, killing one woman and injuring more than a dozen other people.\n\n\"By our president saying things such as he does, supporting white supremacy and the Nazis and KKK, it's causing a lot of trauma,\" Chappelle-Nadal said.\n\nChappelle-Nadal, who is black, was elected to the Missouri Senate in 2010, after serving in the state House for five years.\n\nShe has been an outspoken activist while in the Legislature.

Maria Chappelle-Nadal told The Kansas City Star she posted the comment out of frustration with the \"trauma and despair\" the president is causing with his statements about the events in Charlottesville, Va.\n\n\"The way I responded this morning was wrong,\" she told The Star. \"I'm frustrated. Did I mean the statement? No. Am I frustrated? Absolutely. The president is causing damage. He's causing hate.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal posted the comment on her personal Facebook page, which is not open to the public.\n\n\"On my personal Facebook, I put up a statement saying, 'I really hate Trump. He's causing trauma and nightmares.' That was my original post,\" she said. \"A whole bunch of people responded to that.\"\n\nLater in the thread, in response to another commenter, she wrote: \"I hope Trump is assassinated!\"\n\nShe later deleted the comment.\n\n\"It was wrong for me to post that,\" Chappelle-Nadal said. \"But I am not going to shy away from the damage this president is causing.\"\n\nIn Charlottesville, white nationalists and counterprotesters clashed over the removal of a Confederate monument. An alleged white supremacist drove his car into a crowd near the city's downtown mall, killing a 32-year-old woman.\n\nTrump reacted to the events in Charlottesville by saying \"both sides\" were to blame for the violence, comments that drew immediate criticism from across the political spectrum.\n\nChappelle-Nadal noted that it was recently the two-year anniversary of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson -- a city she represents in the Missouri Senate. Additionally, the NAACP recently issued a travel advisory for Missouri, warning people to be careful while in the state because of a danger that civil rights won't be respected.\n\n\"There are people who are afraid of going out in the streets. It's worse than even Ferguson.\"\n\nTrump's comments \"make it easier for racists to be racists,\" Chappelle-Nadal said.\n\n\"As long as I have a voice,\" she said, \"I'm going to talk about the damage (Trump) is creating in this nation.\"\n\nHer Facebook comment, which was first reported by a conservative radio host in St. Louis, was condemned by Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh, a St. Louis County Democrat.\n\n\"Promoting, supporting or suggesting violence against anyone, especially our elected leaders, is never acceptable,\" Walsh said in a statement. \"There is too much rancor and hate in today's political discourse, and Sen. Chappelle-Nadal should be ashamed of herself for adding her voice to this toxic environment.\"\n\nThe comment also drew a call for her resignation from at least one leading GOP lawmaker.\n\n\"This is disgusting,\" Rep. Kirk Mathews, a St. Louis County Republican, tweeted. \"You should be ashamed. Resign.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal dismissed the call for her to step down.\n\n\"I don't even know who he is. If he didn't show up in Ferguson, then I don't know who he is,\" she said. \"I'm not resigning.\"", "id": "9754327", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "'I hope Trump is assassinated,'

Claire McCaskill, U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay and other top Missouri Democrats called Thursday for the resignation of fellow Democrat Maria Chappelle-Nadal, a state senator from University City, for posting a Facebook comment stating: \"I hope Trump is assassinated!\"\n\n\"I condemn it,\" McCaskill said in a brief emailed statement. \"It's outrageous. And she should resign.\"\n\n\"(C)alling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime,\" noted Clay, a St. Louis based-congressman who Chappelle-Nadal unsuccessfully challenged in last year's Democratic primary. He called her \"an embarrassment to our state,\" adding: \"She should resign immediately.\"\n\nAnother St. Louis Democrat, state Rep. Joshua Peters, issued a letter to the Missouri House committee that deals with member ethics asking for Chappelle-Nadal's removal from office, calling her \"an embarrassment nationally for the Missouri General Assembly.\"\n\nIn response to those and a growing list of other calls for her to step down, Chappelle-Nadal told the Post-Dispatch: \"I am not resigning . . . What I said was wrong, but I am not going to stop talking about what led to that, which is the frustration and anger that many people across America are feeling right now.\"\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service confirmed it is investigating her Facebook post.\n\nChappelle-Nadal's comment, referring to President Donald Trump, was posted Thursday morning and quickly removed. But Chappelle-Nadal acknowledged she had written it in response to another commenter before deleting it.\n\n\"I didn't mean what I put up. Absolutely not. I was very frustrated,\" Chappelle-Nadal told the newspaper. \"Things have got to change.\"\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service's St. Louis field office \"is looking into this,\" the office confirmed.\n\nKristina Schmidt, special agent in charge, told the Post-Dispatch that \"hypothetically\" in such investigations, agents try to \"determine intent, to determine if there was a violation of federal law. If there is, then we refer it to the U.S. Attorney.\"\n\n\"Our primary goal is to determine if there is intent and meaning behind it,\" Schmidt said.\n\nRichard Callahan, former U.S. attorney in St. Louis, said that, generally in cases involving such threats, \"we try to distinguish between 'stupid' and (actual) intent.\" He said the \"bottom line\" is the question of whether the person was serious about making the threatened action happen.\n\nAnother factor, he said, is \"whether it's a person of influence. You look at the person's station in life, whether they might have influence over others.\"\n\nAccording to a screenshot of the now-deleted conversation obtained by the Post-Dispatch, another commenter named Christopher Gagn\u00e9 was writing about a cousin of his who he said was on Trump's Secret Service detail.\n\n\"But, what I posted earlier, I truly believe will happen, sooner ... not later,\" he wrote.\n\nIn a subsequent interview with the Post-Dispatch, Gagn\u00e9 said that wasn't a reference to assassination, but to his earlier-stated belief that Vice President Mike Pence will use the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to have Trump removed from office.\n\n\"Damn,\" Gagn\u00e9 then wrote, \"now I'll probably get a visit from the secret service smdh.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal responded: \"No. I will. I hope Trump is assassinated!\"\n\nIn an interview, Chappelle-Nadal said her comment stemmed from frustration over the events in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend, in which a white supremacist protester allegedly rammed his car into a group of counter-protesters, killing a 32-year-old woman.\n\nTrump's reaction to the tragedy, which included the assertion that \"both sides\" of the protests were to blame for the violence, has drawn criticism across the political spectrum.\n\n\"I put that up on my personal Facebook and I should not have,\" Chappelle-Nadal said. \"It was in response to the concerns that I am hearing from residents of St. Louis. I have deleted it, and it should have been deleted, but there is something way more important that we should be talking about.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal said that in the wake of Charlottesville, \"there are people who are afraid of white supremacists, there are people who are having nightmares. there are people who are afraid of going out in the streets. It's worse than even Ferguson.\"\n\nOn Facebook, Gagn\u00e9 identifies himself as an \"investigative journalist covering police misconduct and shootings,\" and the head of a group called the United States Prisoners Rights Defense League. Chappelle-Nadal said she knew of him from his involvement in protests during the unrest in Ferguson.\n\nAmong other top Democrats to slam Chappelle-Nadal was Missouri Party Chair Stephen Webber, who called her comments \"indefensible,\" and Missouri Senate Democratic Caucus leader Sen. Gina Walsh, who wrote that she \"should be ashamed of herself.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Republican Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard, when asked to comment on Chappelle-Nadal's post, said: \"He supports Sen. Walsh's statement.\"\n\nJoe Holleman of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Maria Chappelle-Nadal said she was wrong for writing the post and didn't mean what she said, but she refused calls to resign.

The Democratic Senator says she didn't mean what she posted Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017, but was frustrated with the president's reaction to the violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Va.(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson, File)\n\nThe post drew a swift rebuke, including calls from top Democrats for her resignation.\n\nAmong them were Missouri Senate Democratic Leader Gina Walsh, who condemned Chappelle-Nadal's post as \"horrible.\" The chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party, Stephen Webber, said the comments were \"indefensible\" and the party \"will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the president.\"\n\n\"I condemn it. It's outrageous,\" added Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, the state's senior senator. \"And she should resign.\"\n\nThe state Republican party also called for her resignation, but Chappelle-Nadal said she had no intention of doing so.\n\n\"I refuse to resign for exercising my First Amendment rights, even though what I said was wrong,\" she said.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service released a statement saying it looks into all threats against the president, \"whether they be direct, implied, or comments in passing.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal, from the St. Louis suburb of University City, said constituents in her predominantly black district are concerned about how Trump blamed \"both sides\" of the clashes in Charlottesville.

All sides need to agree that there is no room for suggestions of political violence in America -- and the Missouri Democratic Party will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the President. I believe she should resign.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal didn't immediately respond to a Post-Dispatch message asking her reaction to calls for her resignation. But prior to those calls, she told KMOX Radio she wouldn't. \"Absolutely not. That's ridiculous,\" she told the station.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service has confirmed it is investigating her Facebook post.\n\nChappelle-Nadal's comment, referring to President Donald Trump, has since been removed. But Chappelle-Nadal confirmed to the Post-Dispatch earlier Thursday that she had written it in response to another commenter before deleting it.\n\n\"I didn't mean what I put up. Absolutely not. I was very frustrated,\" Chappelle-Nadal told the newspaper. \"Things have got to change.\"\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service's St. Louis field office \"is looking into this,\" the office confirmed.\n\nKristina Schmidt, special agent in charge, told the Post-Dispatch that \"hypothetically\" in such investigations, agents try to \"determine intent, to determine if there was a violation of federal law. If there is, then we refer it to the U.S. Attorney.\"\n\n\"Our primary goal is to determine if there is intent and meaning behind it,\" Schmidt said.\n\nAccording to a screenshot of the now-deleted conversation obtained by the Post-Dispatch, another commenter named Christopher Gagn\u00e9 was writing about a cousin of his who he said was on Trump's Secret Service detail.\n\n\"But, what I posted earlier, I truly believe will happen, sooner ... not later,\" he wrote.\n\nIn a subsequent interview with the Post-Dispatch, Gagn\u00e9 said that wasn't a reference to assassination, but to his earlier-stated belief that Vice President Mike Pence will use the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to have Trump removed from office.\n\n\"Damn,\" Gagn\u00e9 then wrote, \"now I'll probably get a visit from the secret service smdh.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal responded: \"No. I will. I hope Trump is assassinated!\"\n\nIn an interview, Chappelle-Nadal said her comment stemmed from frustration over the events in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend, in which a white supremacist protester allegedly rammed his car into a group of counter-protesters, killing a 32-year-old woman.\n\nTrump's reaction to the tragedy, which included the assertion that \"both sides\" of the protests were to blame for the violence, has drawn criticism across the political spectrum.\n\n\"I put that up on my personal Facebook and I should not have,\" Chappelle-Nadal said. \"It was in response to the concerns that I am hearing from residents of St. Louis. I have deleted it, and it should have been deleted, but there is something way more important that we should be talking about.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal said that in the wake of Charlottesville, \"there are people who are afraid of white supremacists, there are people who are having nightmares. there are people who are afraid of going out in the streets. It's worse than even Ferguson.\"\n\nOn Facebook, Gagn\u00e9 identifies himself as an \"investigative journalist covering police misconduct and shootings,\" and the head of a group called the United States Prisoners Rights Defense League. Chappelle-Nadal said she knew of him from his involvement in protests during the unrest in Ferguson.\n\nIn a statement, Missouri Senate Democratic Caucus leader Sen. Gina Walsh said, in part: \"I strongly condemn and disavow Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal's horrible comments. Promoting, supporting or suggesting violence against anyone, especially our elected leaders, is never acceptable. There is too much rancor and hate in today's political discourse, and Sen. Chappelle-Nadal should be ashamed of herself for adding her voice to this toxic environment.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Republican Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard, when asked to comment on Chappelle-Nadal's post, said: \"He supports Sen. Walsh's statement.\"\n\nJoe Holleman of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.\n\nThis is a developing story.

She said the agency looks at all threats \"against the president, vice president, and other protectees, whether they be direct, implied, or comments in passing.\"\n\nThe Facebook comment brought upon Chappelle-Nadal a ream of criticism from Missouri's national and local leaders.\n\nU.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill said in a statement: \"I condemn it. It's outrageous. And she should resign.\" U.S. Rep. Lacy Clay, who Chappelle-Nadal ran against in a Democratic primary last year, said in a statement that the senator \"repeatedly demeaned her office and she is an embarrassment to our state.\"\n\nMissouri Democratic Party Chairman Stephen Webber said the comments were \"indefensible,\" adding the party \"will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the president. I believe she should resign.\"\n\nLt. Gov. Mike Parson, the president of the Missouri Senate, said he believes Chappelle-Nadal \"should immediately resign from her position, as this is conduct not befitting of a state senator or a Missourian.\" Republican Rep. Kirk Mathews of Eureka said the same thing. Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh, D-Bellefontaine Neighbors, said Chappelle-Nadal's \"unacceptable behavior\" has \"no place in our caucus, the Capitol, or the Democratic Party.\" And state Rep. Joshua Peters, a St. Louis Democrat who has clashed with Chappelle-Nadal, called for the Missouri Senate to form a committee to censure and expel her. But Chappelle-Nadal stressed that she would not step down from her Senate seat, which takes in portions of central and northern St. Louis County.\n\n\"I've seen that, but that doesn't influence me at all,\" said Chappelle-Nadal, referring to McCaskill and Webber's statements. \"No one is going to speak for African-Americans like I do.\"\n\nShe added: \"I do not wish any harm to our president. But I am not going to stop talking about the chaos he's creating in this nation.\"\n\nLater in the day, she tweeted that Trump has \"made our communities unsafe\" and that people are hurting because of him.\n\nEarlier this week, Chappelle-Nadal tweeted that the \"Missouri KKK chapter will be marching in St. Louis.\" But St. Louis Public Radio talked with St. Louis officials and the National Park Service, all of which said there was no confirmation of any such rally.\n\nChappelle-Nadal was first elected to the Senate in 2010.

(AP) -- A Missouri lawmaker acknowledged Thursday that she posted and later deleted a comment on Facebook about hoping for President Donald Trump's assassination, saying she was frustrated with the president's response to the white supremacist rally and violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal said she was wrong for writing the post and didn't mean what she said, but she refused calls to resign. She said she wrote \"I hope Trump is assassinated!\" in response to a post that suggested Vice President Mike Pence would try to have Trump removed from office.\n\n\"What I wrote down on my private Facebook page, was it wrong? Absolutely,\" she told The Associated Press. \"But I am going to continue to talk about the anger and the frustration that led to that.\"\n\nThe post drew a swift rebuke, including calls from top Democrats for her resignation.\n\nAmong them were Missouri Senate Democratic Leader Gina Walsh, who condemned Chappelle-Nadal's post as \"horrible.\" The chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party, Stephen Webber, said the comments were \"indefensible\" and the party \"will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the president.\"\n\n\"I condemn it. It's outrageous,\" added Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, the state's senior senator. \"And she should resign.\"\n\nMissouri's Republican Gov.

An alleged white supremacist drove his car into a crowd near the city's downtown mall, killing a 32-year-old woman.\n\nTrump reacted to the events in Charlottesville by saying \"both sides\" were to blame for the violence, comments that drew immediate criticism from across the political spectrum.\n\nChappelle-Nadal noted that it was recently the two-year anniversary of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson -- a city she represents in the Missouri Senate. Additionally, the NAACP recently issued a travel advisory for Missouri, warning people to be careful while in the state because of a danger that civil rights won't be respected.\n\n\"There are people who are afraid of going out in the streets.

Maria Chappelle-Nadal said she was wrong for writing the post and didn't mean what she said, but she refused calls to resign.

Maria Chappelle-Nadal said she was wrong for writing the post and didn't mean what she said, but she refused calls to resign. She said she wrote \"I hope Trump is assassinated!\" in response to a post that suggested Vice President Mike Pence would try to have Trump removed from office.\n\n\"What I wrote down on my private Facebook page, was it wrong? Absolutely,\" she told The Associated Press. \"But I am going to continue to talk about the anger and the frustration that led to that.\"\n\nThe post drew a swift rebuke, including calls from top Democrats for her resignation.\n\nAmong them were Missouri Senate Democratic Leader Gina Walsh, who condemned Chappelle-Nadal's post as \"horrible.\" The chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party, Stephen Webber, said the comments were \"indefensible\" and the party \"will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the president.\"\n\n\"I condemn it. It's outrageous,\" added Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, the state's senior senator. \"And she should resign.\"\n\nMissouri's Republican Gov.

The violence included a man slamming his car into people protesting against the white supremacist rally, killing one woman and injuring more than a dozen other people.\n\n\"By our president saying things such as he does, supporting white supremacy and the Nazis and KKK, it's causing a lot of trauma,\" Chappelle-Nadal said.\n\nChappelle-Nadal, who is black, was elected to the Missouri Senate in 2010, after serving in the state House for five years.\n\nShe has been an outspoken activist while in the Legislature.

Two state troopers also died when the helicopter in which they were observing the gathering crashed.\n\nSt. Louis Field Office of the Secret Service is investigating the comments, according to U.S. Secret Service spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan.

(AP) - A Missouri lawmaker acknowledged Thursday that she posted and later deleted a comment on Facebook about hoping for President Donald Trump's assassination, saying she was frustrated with the president's response to the white supremacist rally and violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal said she was wrong for writing the post and didn't mean what she said, but she refused calls to resign. She said she wrote \"I hope Trump is assassinated!\" in response to a post that suggested Vice President Mike Pence would try to have Trump removed from office.\n\n\"What I wrote down on my private Facebook page, was it wrong? Absolutely,\" she told The Associated Press. \"But I am going to continue to talk about the anger and the frustration that led to that.\"\n\nThe post drew a swift rebuke, including calls from top Democrats for her resignation.\n\nAmong them were Missouri Senate Democratic Leader Gina Walsh, who condemned Chappelle-Nadal's post as \"horrible.\" The chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party, Stephen Webber, said the comments were \"indefensible\" and the party \"will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the president.\"\n\n\"I condemn it. It's outrageous,\" added Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, the state's senior senator. \"And she should resign.\"\n\nMissouri's Republican Gov. Eric Greitens and the state Republican party also called for her resignation, but Chappelle-Nadal said she had no intention of doing so.\n\n\"I refuse to resign for exercising my First Amendment rights, even though what I said was wrong,\" she said.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service released a statement saying it looks into all threats against the president, \"whether they be direct, implied, or comments in passing.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal, from the St. Louis suburb of University City, said constituents in her predominantly black district are concerned about how Trump blamed \"both sides\" of the clashes in Charlottesville. The violence included a man slamming his car into people protesting against the white supremacist rally, killing one woman and injuring more than a dozen other people.\n\n\"By our president saying things such as he does, supporting white supremacy and the Nazis and KKK, it's causing a lot of trauma,\" Chappelle-Nadal said.\n\nChappelle-Nadal, who is black, was elected to the Missouri Senate in 2010, after serving in the state House for five years.\n\nShe has been an outspoken activist while in the Legislature. She was a prominent voice during the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after the police killing of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old resident who was unarmed when fatally shot by an officer in 2014.\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press writers Jim Salter in St. Louis and Summer Ballentine in Jefferson City contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Absolutely not.* I was very frustrated.

If there is, then we refer it to the U.S. Attorney.\"\n\n*\"Our primary goal is to determine if there is intent and meaning behind it,\"* Schmidt said.\n\nMeanwhile, Chappelle-Nadal told the Post-Dispatch that her comment was posted in response to \"concerns that I am hearing from residents of St. Louis.\"\n\nIn an interview, Chappelle-Nadal said her comment stemmed from frustration over the events in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend, in which a white supremacist protester allegedly rammed his car into a group of counter-protesters, killing a 32-year-old woman.\n\n\"I put that up on my personal Facebook and I should not have,\" Chappelle-Nadal said. *\"It was in response to the concerns that I am hearing from residents of St. Louis.* I have deleted it, and it should have been deleted, but there is something way more important that we should be talking about.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal said that in the wake of Charlottesville, *\"there are people who are afraid of white supremacists, there are people who are having nightmares. there are people who are afraid of going out in the streets. It's worse than even Ferguson.\"*\n\nSo, if we understand the logic flow correctly, Chappelle-Nadal apparently figured that killing President Trump would rid the world of hate groups and simultaneously address all of the concerns of her constituents in St. Louis?", "id": "9860771", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Democratic Missouri Senator: I Hope Trump Is Assassinated!", "image": "http://cdn.newsserve.net/700/i/20170818/1895-Democratic-Missouri-Senator-Hope-Trump-Is.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 8, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 22}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "191014", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internet"}, "id": "302869", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"}, {"location": null, "score": 4, "id": "303567", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "id": "304050", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}, "id": "304757", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}, "id": "305157", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}, "id": "305504", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Protest"}, "id": "319773", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest"}, {"label": {"eng": "Special agent"}, "id": "331792", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_agent"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of FBI field offices"}, "id": "336559", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FBI_field_offices"}, {"label": {"eng": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "id": "342299", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Post-Dispatch"}, {"label": {"eng": "Federal law"}, "id": "399171", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Missouri Senate"}, "id": "506774", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Maria Chappelle-Nadal"}, "id": "758604", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Chappelle-Nadal"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 374, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 761, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations"}], "time": "09:22:00"}

An alleged white supremacist drove his car into a crowd near the city's downtown mall, killing a 32-year-old woman.\n\nTrump reacted to the events in Charlottesville by saying \"both sides\" were to blame for the violence, comments that drew immediate criticism from across the political spectrum.\n\nChappelle-Nadal noted that it was recently the three-year anniversary of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson--a city she represents in the Missouri Senate. Additionally, the NAACP recently issued a travel advisory for Missouri, warning people to be careful while in the state because of a danger that civil rights won't be respected.\n\n\"There are people who are afraid of going out in the streets. It's worse than even Ferguson.\"\n\nTrump's comments \"make it easier for racists to be racists,\" Chappelle-Nadal said.\n\n\"As long as I have a voice,\" she said, \"I'm going to talk about the damage (Trump) is creating in this nation.\"\n\nHer Facebook comment, which was first reported by a conservative radio host in St. Louis, was condemned by Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh, a St. Louis County Democrat.\n\n\"Promoting, supporting or suggesting violence against anyone, especially our elected leaders, is never acceptable,\" Walsh said in a statement. \"There is too much rancor and hate in today's political discourse, and Sen. Chappelle-Nadal should be ashamed of herself for adding her voice to this toxic environment.\"\n\nThe comment also drew a call for her resignation from at least one leading GOP lawmaker.\n\n\"This is disgusting,\" Rep. Kirk Mathews, a St. Louis County Republican, tweeted. \"You should be ashamed.

Maria Chappelle-Nadal went on her personal Facebook page Thursday morning to vent.\n\n\"I put up a statement saying, 'I really hate Trump. He's causing trauma and nightmares.' That was my original post,\" she told the Kansas City Star.\n\nThe Facebook post received many responses, Chappelle-Nadal said, and to one she replied, \"I hope Trump is assassinated!\"\n\n[Trump embraces culture war with call to preserve Confederate statues]\n\nShe would later explain that she didn't actually wish harm to come to Trump but wrote it out of frustration.\n\n\"I didn't mean what I put up. Absolutely not,\" Chappelle-Nadal told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"It was in response to the concerns that I am hearing from residents of St. Louis.\"\n\n\"There are people who are afraid of white supremacists,\" she added. \"There are people who are having nightmares. There are people who are afraid of going out in the streets. It's worse than even Ferguson.\"\n\nThough she quickly deleted the comment, an image of the statement would soon circulate online.\n\nMuch like when comedian Kathy Griffin released a video and photo of her holding a mask made in the image of Trump's bloody severed head, a backlash soon came, much of its from other Democrats in the state.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) released a statement condemning the remark and saying Chappelle-Nadal should resign.\n\nRep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) said that, \"(C)alling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime. ... (She is) an embarrassment to our state,\" according to the Post-Dispatch.\n\nCalls for her resignation came from Republican Gov. Eric Greitens and Missouri's Democratic Party chairman, Stephen Webber, while a statement by Senate Minority Leader Gina Walsh said that, \"There is too much rancor and hate in today's political discourse, and Sen. Chappelle-Nadal should be ashamed of herself for adding her voice to this toxic environment.\"\n\nStatement from Senate Democratic Caucus leader Sen. Gina Walsh: pic.twitter.com/ocIFWO8Vvx\n\n-- Senate Democrats (@MoSenDems) August 17, 2017\n\nThe Secret Service said it is \"looking into the comments,\" adding that all threats made against the president, vice president and other protected persons are investigated, whether the threats are direct, implied or made in passing, according to the Associated Press.\n\nChappelle-Nadal, who joined the state Senate in 2010, told the AP that while she should not have posted the comment, she was expressing her right to free speech.\n\nTrump's comments about Charlottesville \"make it easier for racists to be racists,\" she told the Star. \"As long as I have a voice, I'm going to talk about the damage (Trump) is creating in this nation.\"\n\nShe has also refused calls to resign from her fellow Democrats, with whom she has clashed in the past.\n\n[Now you can see what Donald Trump sees every time he opens Twitter]\n\nChappelle-Nadal had likened those looking to hand control of the St. Louis police force from the state to local authorities to \"house slaves, \" according to the Post Dispatch. In 2014, she criticized the response of former Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon to unrest in Ferguson, at one point tweeting the governor, \"I want a public apology for the Missouri Hwy Patrol excessively tear gassing a Senator & her constituents for 3 hrs 1st night!\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal did not immediate respond to requests for comment.\n\nShe was, however, active on Twitter Thursday evening, retweeting those who supported her and then reiterating that she would not resign.\n\nI am not resigning.

(AP) -- A Missouri lawmaker acknowledged Thursday that she posted and later deleted a comment on Facebook about hoping for President Donald Trump's assassination, saying she was frustrated with the president's response to the white supremacist rally and violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal said she was wrong for writing the post and didn't mean what she said, but she refused calls to resign. She said she wrote \"I hope Trump is assassinated!\" in response to a post that suggested Vice President Mike Pence would try to have Trump removed from office.\n\n\"What I wrote down on my private Facebook page, was it wrong? Absolutely,\" she told The Associated Press. \"But I am going to continue to talk about the anger and the frustration that led to that.\"\n\nThe post drew a swift rebuke, including calls from top Democrats for her resignation.\n\nAmong them were Missouri Senate Democratic Leader Gina Walsh, who condemned Chappelle-Nadal's post as \"horrible.\" The chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party, Stephen Webber, said the comments were \"indefensible\" and the party \"will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the president.\"\n\n\"I condemn it. It's outrageous,\" added Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, the state's senior senator. \"And she should resign.\"\n\nThe state Republican party also called for her resignation, but Chappelle-Nadal said she had no intention of doing so.\n\n\"I refuse to resign for exercising my First Amendment rights, even though what I said was wrong,\" she said.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service released a statement saying it looks into all threats against the president, \"whether they be direct, implied, or comments in passing.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal, from the St. Louis suburb of University City, said constituents in her predominantly black district are concerned about how Trump blamed \"both sides\" of the clashes in Charlottesville. The violence included a man slamming his car into people protesting against the white supremacist rally, killing one woman and injuring more than a dozen other people.\n\n\"By our president saying things such as he does, supporting white supremacy and the Nazis and KKK, it's causing a lot of trauma,\" Chappelle-Nadal said.\n\nChappelle-Nadal, who is black, was elected to the Missouri Senate in 2010, after serving in the state House for five years.\n\nShe has been an outspoken activist while in the Legislature. She was a prominent voice during the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after the police killing of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old resident who was unarmed when fatally shot by an officer in 2014.\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press writers Jim Salter in St. Louis and Summer Ballentine in Jefferson City contributed to this report.", "id": "9777986", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Missouri lawmaker posts, deletes Trump assassination comment", "image": "http://hosted2.ap.org/CBImages/?media=photo&contentId=a7640fa9741048078a1aa5a83fc36834&fmt=jpg&Role=Preview&reldt=2017-08-17T20:08:41GMT&authToken=eNoFwjEKADEIBMAXCcp6uhZ5jIQE0l15RR5%2fzNz1jUCAwTSUqkaBd57RGa67S9JNxakpbGvpp4k9EYTf8w4rJmBV%2fgPx0xNd", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "190817", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "id": "302944", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "303567", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "id": "304050", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}, "id": "304323", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"}, {"label": {"eng": "African American"}, "id": "304393", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"}, {"label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}, "id": "304754", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}, "id": "304757", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}, "id": "304965", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}, "id": "305157", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}, "id": "305919", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "George W.

The Post-Dispatch also reported that Chappelle-Nadal confirmed that she wrote the \"I hope Trump is assassinated\" message on her personal Facebook page. She told the newspaper that \"I didn't mean what I put up. Absolutely not. I was very frustrated.\"\n\n\"She made the comment in an exchange with a left-wing activist who claimed that his cousin is a Secret Service agent,\" The Daily Caller asserted.\n\nChappelle-Nadal has rejected demands for her to resign her political position and has refused to apologize for the Facebook entry. She told CBS St. Louis affiliate KMOX that \"When the president apologizes, I'll apologize. I'm not apologizing for being frustrated and angry at the bigot that we have in our White House.\"\n\nApparently the senator is very upset with Trump's comment that both sides, i.e., the far right and the far left, were to blame in the Charlottesville incident that led to a 32-year-old woman being killed, a controversy that continues to consume a lot of media oxygen. Trump's remarks have been very disturbing to her constituents in the St. Louis area, Chappelle-Nadal claims, giving rise to fears of white supremacists.\n\nChappelle-Nadal was elected to the state house of representatives in 2004 before winning a seat in the state senate in 2010. She unsuccessfuly ran for a seat in the U.S. Congress in 2014.\n\nReflecting the sentiments of the state's political hierarchy, Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, said that \"We can have differences in our country, but no one should encourage political violence. The Senator should resign,\" the Springfield News-Leader chronicled. Others joining in the condemnation of the Chappelle-Nadal Facebook post include U.S. Senator Clarie McCaskill, a Democrat, and Missouri Democratic Party chair Stephen Webber, as well as various state lawmakers.\n\nBack in June, actor Johnny Depp apologized for what he called a \"bad joke\" about a Trump assassination while attending the Glastonbury festival in England.\n\nThe firestorm over Maria Chappelle-Nadal's Facebook \"I hope Trump is assassinated\" message is a developing story.

Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City, wrote during a morning Facebook exchange, referring to Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nShe quickly deleted her post, but not quickly enough. By midafternoon, the political verdicts of her own party were rolling in:\n\nU.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.: \"I condemn it. It's outrageous. And she should resign.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis: \"(C)alling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime. ... (She is) an embarrassment to our state. She should resign immediately.\"\n\nMissouri Democratic Party Chair Stephen Webber: \"The ... Party will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the President. I believe she should resign.\"\n\nMissouri Senate Democratic Caucus leader Sen. Gina Walsh: \"(She) should be ashamed of herself for adding her voice to this toxic environment.\"\n\nRepublican Gov. Eric Greitens said in a statement: \"We can have differences in our country, but no one should encourage political violence. The senator should resign.\"\n\nLt. Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, and state Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat, also called for Chappelle-Nadal's resignation.\n\nIn an interview, Chappelle-Nadal acknowledged she wrote the offending line on her personal Facebook page in response to another commenter before deleting it.\n\n\"I didn't mean what I put up. Absolutely not. I was very frustrated. Things have got to change,\" Chappelle-Nadal told the Post-Dispatch. \"It was in response to the concerns that I am hearing from residents of St. Louis. I have deleted it, and it should have been deleted, but there is something way more important that we should be talking about.\"\n\nShe added later: \"I am not resigning ... What I said was wrong, but I am not going to stop talking about what led to that, which is the frustration and anger that many people across America are feeling right now.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal said her comment stemmed from frustration over the events in Charlottesville over the weekend, in which a white supremacist protester allegedly rammed his car into a group of counterprotesters, killing a 32-year-old woman.\n\nTrump's reaction to the tragedy, which included the assertion that \"both sides\" of the protests were to blame for the violence, has drawn criticism across the political spectrum.\n\n\"There are people who are afraid of white supremacists\" in the aftermath of Charlottesville, she said. \"There are people who are having nightmares. There are people who are afraid of going out in the streets. It's worse than even Ferguson.\"\n\nAccording to a screenshot of the now-deleted conversation obtained by the Post-Dispatch, another commenter named Christopher Gagn\u00e9 was writing about a cousin of his who he said was on Trump's Secret Service detail.\n\n\"But, what I posted earlier, I truly believe will happen, sooner ... not later,\" he wrote.\n\nIn a subsequent interview with the Post-Dispatch, Gagn\u00e9 said that wasn't a reference to assassination, but to his earlier-stated belief that Vice President Mike Pence will use the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to have Trump removed from office.\n\n\"Damn,\" Gagn\u00e9 then wrote, \"now I'll probably get a visit from the Secret Service.\" He followed that comment with \"smdh,\" an abbreviation for \"shaking my damn head.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal responded: \"No. I will. I hope Trump is assassinated!\"\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service's St. Louis field office \"is looking into this,\" the office confirmed Thursday.\n\nKristina Schmidt, special agent in charge, told the Post-Dispatch that \"hypothetically\" in such investigations, agents try to \"determine intent, to determine if there was a violation of federal law. If there is, then we refer it to the U.S. attorney.\"\n\n\"Our primary goal is to determine if there is intent and meaning behind it,\" Schmidt said.\n\nRichard Callahan, former U.S. attorney in St. Louis, said that generally in cases involving such threats, \"we try to distinguish between 'stupid' and (actual) intent.\" He said the \"bottom line\" is the question of whether the person was serious about making the threatened action happen.\n\nAnother factor, he said, is \"whether it's a person of influence. You look at the person's station in life, whether they might have influence over others.\"\n\nIn addition to partywide condemnation of Chappelle-Nadal's post, state Rep. Joshua Peters, D-St. Louis, issued a formal request Thursday to the Missouri Senate committee that deals with member ethics asking for Chappelle-Nadal's removal from office, calling her \"an embarrassment nationally for the Missouri General Assembly.\"\n\nThe furious responses from Chappelle-Nadal's own party might at least partly reflect her history of internal political strife as an outspoken critic of people on both sides of the aisle.\n\nFirst elected to the House in 2004, she served three terms before winning a four-way primary for the Senate's 14th District in 2010.\n\nIn January 2015, she filed a proposal in the Senate seeking the ouster of former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, for his actions in relation to the August 2014 death of a black teenager in Ferguson by a white police officer. In her proposal, she said Nixon \"seems only to acknowledge the existence of the African-American community on or about election day.\"\n\nThe measure went nowhere. But her attacks on Nixon never dimmed. In a tweet at the time of the protests in Ferguson, Chappelle-Nadal wrote: \"You don't know s*** because you never communicate. F* you, governor!\"\n\nShe's also tried to exert political payback against her foes. She spent nearly $20,000 on negative ads against Rep. Joe Adams, whom she had defeated in her race for the Senate five years previously.\n\nShe got into a fight with Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, at a Lil Wayne concert at Scottrade Center in 2011 over legislation regarding local control of the city police department.\n\nLast year, she unsuccessfully challenged Clay, the St. Louis-based congressman, in the Democratic primary.\n\nDuring the most recent legislative session, Chappelle-Nadal focused her efforts on a controversial buyout program for homeowners in the Spanish Village neighborhood of Bridgeton who have been impacted by pollution in the nearby Westlake Landfill.\n\nInitially, she wanted her colleagues to approve a $12 million program and threatened to shut down the Senate with a filibuster if it didn't move forward. She backed off when the Senate endorsed a $1 million pilot program.

LOUIS - A Missouri state senator is under fire after a post on social media where she said she hoped the president would be assassinated.\n\nMaria Chappelle-Nadal was replying to a comment on her personal Facebook page Thursday morning when she said \"I hope Trump is assassinated!\"\n\nThe comment was deleted a short while later, but not before KMOX's Mark Reardon took a screenshot and posted it to Twitter.\n\n5 On Your Side interviewed Chappelle-Nadal after the post was deleted. She told us the comment was \"inappropriate\" and that she regretted posting it, but said she will not apologize and refuses to resign.\n\n\"It was a bad decision that I made, and I made it out of frustration,\" she said. \"It was inappropriate.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post, Governor Eric Greitens called for Chappelle-Nadal to resign.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill released the following statement on Natal's comments:\n\n\"I condemn it. It's outrageous. And she should resign.\"\n\nCongressman Wm. Lacy Clay has also called for her resignation:\n\n\"Maria Chappelle-Nadal has a long and troubled history of making vulgar, obscene and completely irresponsible statements.\n\nBut calling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime.\n\nShe has repeatedly demeaned her office and she is an embarrassment to our state.\n\nShe should resign immediately.\"\n\nThe Senate Democratic Caucus says it is condemning the comment.\n\n\"I strongly condemn and disavow Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal's horrible comments. Promoting, supporting or suggesting violence against anyone, especially our elected leaders, is never acceptable. There is too much rancor and hate in today's political discourse, and Sen. Chappelle-Nadal should be ashamed of herself for adding her voice to this toxic environment. Sen. Chappelle-Nadal's unacceptable behavior has no place in our caucus, the Capitol, or the Democratic Party. Let me be clear, her views in no way represent the constituents of the 14th District or the great State of Missouri,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Gina Walsh.\n\nStephen Webber, the Missouri Democratic Party Chair, released the following statement:\n\n\"State Senator Chappelle-Nadal's comments are indefensible. All sides need to agree that there is no room for suggestions of political violence in America - and the Missouri Democratic Party will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the President. I believe she should resign.\"\n\nAnd State Rep. Joshua Peters -- a fellow democrat who has clashed with Nadal before -- wrote a letter to the Missouri Senate leadership calling for an ethics investigation. He said talk of \"assassination\" should be the end of her time in the Senate.\n\n\"There's a level of decorum,\" Peters said. \"There's a level of debate. There's a level of respect that comes with the office that we hold. If she can't understand that then she needs to step aside.\"\n\nAs for any ethics investigation, Peters says it could happen even before lawmakers go back to Jefferson City and would require a simple majority vote by senators to remove her from office.\n\nOne investigation we've confirmed is already underway is the secret service.\n\n\u00a9 2017 KSDK-TV\n\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST", "id": "9861902", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Missouri Senator Posts, Deletes Comment About Trump Assassination", "image": "http://content.ksdk.com/photo/2017/08/17/chappelle_nadal_1503002078073_10286656_ver1.0.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "191014", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}, "id": "302691", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "id": "302948", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "id": "304050", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}, "id": "304323", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethics"}, "id": "304535", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}, "id": "305157", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Talk radio"}, "id": "306009", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_radio"}, {"label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States Senate"}, "id": "307372", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Federal crime in the United States"}, "id": "311382", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_crime_in_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Caucus"}, "id": "322930", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eric Greitens"}, "id": "329128", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Greitens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Missouri Democratic Party"}, "id": "380112", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Democratic_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Claire McCaskill"}, "id": "385844", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_McCaskill"}, {"label": {"eng": "Missouri Senate"}, "id": "506774", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "KMOX"}, "id": "556796", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMOX"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate"}, "id": "705665", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Caucus_of_the_United_States_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Maria Chappelle-Nadal"}, "id": "758604", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Chappelle-Nadal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stephen Webber"}, "id": "885302", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Webber"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lacy Clay"}, "id": "1337113", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacy_Clay"}], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "01:43:00"}

During an abrasive press conference, he also attacked what he called the \"alt-left.\"\n\n\"What about the alt-left that came charging at, as you say, at the alt-right?\" Trump asked. \"Do they have any assemblage of guilt?

Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City, wrote during a morning Facebook exchange, referring to Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nShe quickly deleted her post, but not quickly enough. By midafternoon, the political verdicts of her own party were rolling in:\n\nU.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.: \"I condemn it. It's outrageous. And she should resign.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis: \"(C)alling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime. ... (She is) an embarrassment to our state. She should resign immediately.\"\n\nMissouri Democratic Party Chair Stephen Webber: \"The ... Party will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the President. I believe she should resign.\"\n\nMissouri Senate Democratic Caucus leader Sen. Gina Walsh: \"(She) should be ashamed of herself for adding her voice to this toxic environment.\"\n\nRepublican Gov. Eric Greitens said in a statement: \"We can have differences in our country, but no one should encourage political violence. The senator should resign.\"\n\nLt. Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, and state Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat, also called for Chappelle-Nadal's resignation.\n\nIn an interview, Chappelle-Nadal acknowledged she wrote the offending line on her personal Facebook page in response to another commenter before deleting it.\n\n\"I didn't mean what I put up. Absolutely not. I was very frustrated. Things have got to change,\" Chappelle-Nadal told the Post-Dispatch. \"It was in response to the concerns that I am hearing from residents of St. Louis. I have deleted it, and it should have been deleted, but there is something way more important that we should be talking about.\"\n\nShe added later: \"I am not resigning ... What I said was wrong, but I am not going to stop talking about what led to that, which is the frustration and anger that many people across America are feeling right now.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal said her comment stemmed from frustration over the events in Charlottesville over the weekend, in which a white supremacist protester allegedly rammed his car into a group of counterprotesters, killing a 32-year-old woman.\n\nTrump's reaction to the tragedy, which included the assertion that \"both sides\" of the protests were to blame for the violence, has drawn criticism across the political spectrum.\n\n\"There are people who are afraid of white supremacists\" in the aftermath of Charlottesville, she said. \"There are people who are having nightmares. There are people who are afraid of going out in the streets. It's worse than even Ferguson.\"\n\nAccording to a screenshot of the now-deleted conversation obtained by the Post-Dispatch, another commenter named Christopher Gagn\u00e9 was writing about a cousin of his who he said was on Trump's Secret Service detail.\n\n\"But, what I posted earlier, I truly believe will happen, sooner ... not later,\" he wrote.\n\nIn a subsequent interview with the Post-Dispatch, Gagn\u00e9 said that wasn't a reference to assassination, but to his earlier-stated belief that Vice President Mike Pence will use the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to have Trump removed from office.\n\n\"Damn,\" Gagn\u00e9 then wrote, \"now I'll probably get a visit from the Secret Service.\" He followed that comment with \"smdh,\" an abbreviation for \"shaking my damn head.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal responded: \"No. I will. I hope Trump is assassinated!\"\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service's St. Louis field office \"is looking into this,\" the office confirmed Thursday.\n\nKristina Schmidt, special agent in charge, told the Post-Dispatch that \"hypothetically\" in such investigations, agents try to \"determine intent, to determine if there was a violation of federal law. If there is, then we refer it to the U.S. attorney.\"\n\n\"Our primary goal is to determine if there is intent and meaning behind it,\" Schmidt said.\n\nRichard Callahan, former U.S. attorney in St. Louis, said that generally in cases involving such threats, \"we try to distinguish between 'stupid' and (actual) intent.\" He said the \"bottom line\" is the question of whether the person was serious about making the threatened action happen.\n\nAnother factor, he said, is \"whether it's a person of influence. You look at the person's station in life, whether they might have influence over others.\"\n\nIn addition to partywide condemnation of Chappelle-Nadal's post, state Rep. Joshua Peters, D-St. Louis, issued a formal request Thursday to the Missouri Senate committee that deals with member ethics asking for Chappelle-Nadal's removal from office, calling her \"an embarrassment nationally for the Missouri General Assembly.\"\n\nThe furious responses from Chappelle-Nadal's own party might at least partly reflect her history of internal political strife as an outspoken critic of people on both sides of the aisle.\n\nFirst elected to the House in 2004, she served three terms before winning a four-way primary for the Senate's 14th District in 2010.\n\nIn January 2015, she filed a proposal in the Senate seeking the ouster of former Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, for his actions in relation to the August 2014 death of a black teenager in Ferguson by a white police officer. In her proposal, she said Nixon \"seems only to acknowledge the existence of the African-American community on or about election day.\"\n\nThe measure went nowhere. But her attacks on Nixon never dimmed. In a tweet at the time of the protests in Ferguson, Chappelle-Nadal wrote: \"You don't know s*** because you never communicate. F* you, governor!\"\n\nShe's also tried to exert political payback against her foes. She spent nearly $20,000 on negative ads against Rep. Joe Adams, whom she had defeated in her race for the Senate five years previously.\n\nShe got into a fight with Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, at a Lil Wayne concert at Scottrade Center in 2011 over legislation regarding local control of the city police department.\n\nLast year, she unsuccessfully challenged Clay, the St. Louis-based congressman, in the Democratic primary.\n\nDuring the most recent legislative session, Chappelle-Nadal focused her efforts on a controversial buyout program for homeowners in the Spanish Village neighborhood of Bridgeton who have been impacted by pollution in the nearby Westlake Landfill.\n\nInitially, she wanted her colleagues to approve a $12 million program and threatened to shut down the Senate with a filibuster if it didn't move forward. She backed off when the Senate endorsed a $1 million pilot program. But the House didn't agree and she left the Capitol in May with nothing.\n\nKurt Erickson and Joe Holleman of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.\n\nPolitical Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nBe informed.

LOUIS (KMOX) updated at 2:45 p.m. - A Missouri state senator wrote on social media Thursday morning that she hopes the president is assassinated.\n\nResponding to someone's post on Facebook who said they'd probably get a visit from the secret service, Maria Chappelle-Nadal wrote, \"No I will. I hope Trump is assassinated.\"\n\nKMOX's Carol Daniel asked Chappelle-Nadal if she was going to apologize for her comments. Chappelle-Nadal replied, \"When the President apologizes, I'll apologize. I'm not apologizing for being frustrated and angry at the bigot that we have in our White House.\"\n\nListen to Carol Daniel's full interview with Maria Chappelle-Nadal\n\nWhen asked if she would resign her position as Missouri State Senator, Chappelle-Nadal passionately stated, \"Absolutely not. That's ridiculous.\"\n\nIn a statement issued Thursday, Missouri Democratic Party Chair Stephen Webber called for her resignation.\n\n\"State Senator Chappelle-Nadal's comments are indefensible. All sides need to agree that there is no room for suggestions of political violence in America - and the Missouri Democratic Party will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the President. I believe she should resign,\" Webber said.\n\nU.S. Senator Claire McCaskill agrees. In a statement released Thursday afternoon, McCaskill stated, \"I condemn it. It's outrageous. And she should resign.\"\n\nThe U.S Secret Service in St. Louis told KMOX News it is taking the comment very seriously. Special agent in charge of the Secret Service in St. Louis, Kristina Schmidt, says there is no forum on social media, in letters or in person, that make it okay to make threats against the President.\n\nSchmidt says in cases like this they will investigate the intent and the possibility that a remark may inspire others to take action. She says the next step in a case like what Chappelle-Nadal wrote on Facebook, is to investigate whether or not there is intent to act on the words.\n\nKMOX asked Schmidt if posting on Facebook to say, \"I hope the President is assassinated\" is against the law?\n\nSchmidt replied, \"So that's the Secret Service's job to find out if there was a federal violation committed. The Secret Service has to investigate all of these, whether it's that someone else should do it, that I will do it, the Secret Service will have to investigate to find out if there is intent there. If there is intent there then we will present the case to the United States attorney's office and it will be the United States attorney's office to deem whether or not it's a violation of law and whether or not they will file chargers.\"\n\nShe says there is no specific law concerning threats to the President made on social media.\n\n\"The law is, no matter where you say it, or what venue you say it in...it is against the law,\" Schmidt says.\n\nChappelle-Nadal told KMOX's Mark Reardon on Twitter, \"I put something on my personal Facebook page and it has now been deleted.\"\n\nBut it wasn't deleted before Reardon was able to get his hands on a screenshot of the post.\n\nShe also told Reardon, \"I'm frustrated with this Presdient for causing so much hate.\"", "id": "9773332", "details": {"liCnt": 29}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Maria Chappelle-Nadal: 'I Hope Trump Is Assassinated'", "image": "https://cbsstlouis.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/slp2014100116.jpg?w=1500", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "303567", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}, "id": "305157", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secret service"}, "id": "321691", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_service"}, {"label": {"eng": "Missouri Democratic Party"}, "id": "380112", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Democratic_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Claire McCaskill"}, "id": "385844", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_McCaskill"}, {"label": {"eng": "Missouri Senate"}, "id": "506774", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Senate"}, {"label": {"eng": "KMOX"}, "id": "556796", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMOX"}, {"label": {"eng": "Maria Chappelle-Nadal"}, "id": "758604", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Chappelle-Nadal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stephen Webber"}, "id": "885302", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Webber"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 123, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information"}], "time": "20:38:00"}

Maria Chappelle-Nadal's comment has since been deleted -- but it did not go unnoticed. \"The St. Louis Field Office of the Secret Service is looking into the comments,\" Secret Service spokesperson Cathy Milhoan said in a statement to CNN. \"The Secret Service investigates all threats against the President, Vice President, and other protectees, whether they be direct, implied or comments in passing.According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Chappelle-Nadal's comment said: \"I hope Trump is assassinated!\" She has since deleted the comment and apologized for the language she used, telling CNN affiliate KMOV that the comment arose from her frustration with the current political climate. Read More\"No, I don't want to see anyone assassinated, but he should not be president, he should be impeached,\" Chapelle-Nadal told KMOV. \"Someone wrote a statement on my Facebook and I responded with something that shouldn't have been put up there.\"Lawmakers in the state quickly spoke out against the remark and called for the General Assembly member's resignation. Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, a fellow Democrat, said in a statement: \"I condemn it. It's outrageous. And she should resign.\" Stephen Webber, chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party, said: \"State Senator Chappelle-Nadal's comments are indefensible. All sides need to agree that there is no room for suggestions of political violence in America -- and the Missouri Democratic Party will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the President.

Eric Greitens also demanded she resign in a statement, according to the Post-Dispatch. \"We can have differences in our country, but no one should encourage political violence. The senator should resign,\" Greitens said. Chappelle-Nadal's controversial comment comes amid a week of division and chaos in the US following a weekend of unrest in Charlottesville, Virginia surrounding a white supremacist rally. On Saturday, a car drove through a crowd of counter-protesters, resulting in the death of one woman and injuring several other people. Trump was criticized for his initial response, condemning violence on \"many sides,\" then on Monday he specifically condemned the white supremacist groups. But on Tuesday, when speaking with reporters, he echoed his initial comment and placed the blame again on \"both sides.\" \"I think there is blame on both sides,\" Trump said.Chappelle-Nadal posted her comment on Thursday morning, then was rejecting calls for her to resign by Thursday night.\n\nI am not resigning.

Maria Chappelle-Nadal wrote in a Facebook response \"I hope Trump is assassinated\" before deleting her comments. The post was in response to another user's comment and, despite calls for her to resign, she's blaming President Donald Trump.\n\n\"It was wrong for me to post that,\" Chappelle-Nadal told The Kansas City Star. \"But I am not going to shy away from the damage this president is causing.\"\n\nChappelle-Nadal stated that it was recently the 3-year anniversary of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man shot in Ferguson by Darren Wilson. She, along with a liberally biased media, repeatedly pushed the debunked \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\" narrative that crumbled under forensic and eyewitness scrutiny.\n\nHe was forced to resign from the Ferguson Police Department shortly after becoming a family man, and his life was destroyed. A grand jury, which included three African Americans, decided not to indict Mr. Wilson after spending more than three months reviewing evidence in the case.\n\nThey decided he was defending himself against Brown, a suspect in a strong arm robbery, who assaulted him and attempted to grab his gun. The decision led to widespread rioting by Black Lives Matter (BLM) and other so-called civil rights groups, during which dozens of businesses and cars were looted and burned to the ground.\n\nFerguson is a city Chappelle-Nadal represents in the Missouri Senate, one which suffered greatly from politicians like her using lies to foment hate. She personally held rallies that were precursors for violence later in the day, including one across the street from the fire department.\n\nShe once \"wildly\" accused Jeff Roorda of the St. Louis Police Officer Association of being a racist on CNN, a network that helped to push the hatred-breeding lie. The U.S. Secret Service field office in St. Louis is now investigating the University City Democrat.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill, one of the most vulnerable Red State incumbent Democrats, called on her to resign. Stephen Webber, chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party, agreed.\n\n\"State Sen. Chappelle-Nadal's comments are indefensible,\" Chairman Webber said. \"All sides need to agree that there is no room for suggestions of political violence in America -- and the Missouri Democratic Party will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the president. I believe she should resign.\"", "id": "9827754", "details": {"liCnt": 61}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Missouri Democrat Maria Chappelle-Nadal: 'I Hope Trump Is Assassinated'", "image":

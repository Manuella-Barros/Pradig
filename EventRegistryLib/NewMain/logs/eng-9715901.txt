Prosecutors said Hwang and Halligan lied to banks in order to obtain billions of dollars that they used to artificially pump up the stock prices of multiple publicly traded companies. The trial began in May.\n\nThe Archegos meltdown sent shock waves across Wall Street and drew regulatory scrutiny on three continents.\n\nHwang, 60, had pleaded not guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy, three counts of fraud and seven counts of market manipulation. Halligan, 47, had pleaded not guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and two counts of fraud. Halligan was the chief financial officer at Archegos.\n\nThey now face maximum sentences of 20 years in prison on each charge for which they were convicted, though any sentence would likely be much lower and would be imposed by the judge based on a range of factors.\n\nWhen the charges were brought in 2022, the U.S. Justice Department called the case an example of its commitment to hold accountable people who distort and defraud U.S. financial markets.\n\nThe trial centered on the implosion of Hwang's family office Archegos, which inflicted $10 billion in losses at global banks and, according to prosecutors, and caused more than $100 billion in shareholder losses at companies in its portfolio. Prosecutors said Hwang's actions harmed U.S. financial markets as well as ordinary investors, causing significant losses to banks, market participants and Archegos employees.\n\nHwang secretly amassed outsized stakes in multiple companies without actually holding their stock, according to prosecutors. Hwang lied to banks about the size of the derivative positions of Archegos in order to borrow billions of dollars that he and his deputies then used to artificially inflate the underlying stocks, prosecutors said.\n\nHalligan was accused by prosecutors of lying to banks and enabling the criminal scheme.\n\nDuring closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Thomas told jurors, \"By 2021, the defendants' lies and manipulation had ensnared nearly a dozen stocks and half of Wall Street in a $100 billion fraud, a fraud that came crashing down in a matter of days.\"\n\nHwang's defense team painted the indictment as the \"most aggressive open market manipulation case\" ever brought by U.S. prosecutors. Hwang's attorney Barry Berke told jurors in his closing argument that prosecutors criminalized aggressive but legal trading methods.\n\nArchegos head trader William Tomita and Chief Risk Officer Scott Becker testified as prosecution witnesses after pleading guilty to related charges and agreeing to cooperate in the case.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which brought the case, Hwang's positions eclipsed those of the companies' largest investors, driving up stock prices. At its peak, prosecutors said Archegos had $36 billion in assets and $160 billion of exposure to equities.\n\nWhen stock prices fell in March 2021, the banks demanded additional deposits, which Archegos could not make. The banks then sold the stocks backing Hwang's swaps, wiping out an alleged $100 billion in value for shareholders and billions at the banks, including $5.5 billion for Credit Suisse, now part of UBS, and $2.9 billion for Nomura Holdings.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market manipulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archegos_Capital_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Archegos Capital Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assistant United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomura_Holdings", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nomura Holdings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derivative (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit Suisse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Offshore_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Offshore Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108004196-17206438562024-07-09t181530z_688717635_rc2ur8azyurs_rtrmadp_0_archegos-fraud.jpeg?v=1720643933&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715901", "eventUri": "eng-9715901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 239, "relevance": 1}

Had the banks not lost money, Berke said, \"we would never be here, Mr. Hwang would never be charged with a crime.\"\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Thomas told jurors that Hwang manipulated stocks and worked with Halligan to lie to the banks with which they traded.\n\n\"By 2021, the defendants' lies and manipulation had ensnared nearly a dozen stocks and half of Wall Street in a $100 billion fraud, a fraud that came crashing down in a matter of days,\" Thomas said.\n\nTestimony in the trial, which began in May, showed that Hwang directed Archegos employees to lie to banks and trade in ways intended to drive up the price of stocks he had bet on, Thomas said. Hwang \"behaved as though the rules didn't apply to him,\" Thomas added. In fact, Thomas said, the two defendants \"made fraud their business.\"\n\nProsecutors have accused Hwang of secretly amassing outsized stakes in multiple companies without actually holding their stock.

Prosecutors said Hwang and Halligan lied to banks in order to obtain billions of dollars that they used to artificially pump up the stock prices of multiple publicly traded companies. The trial began in May.\n\nThe Archegos meltdown sent shock waves across Wall Street and drew regulatory scrutiny on three continents.\n\nHwang, 60, had pleaded not guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy, three counts of fraud and seven counts of market manipulation. Halligan, 47, had pleaded not guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and two counts of fraud. Halligan was the chief financial officer at Archegos.\n\nThey now face maximum sentences of 20 years in prison on each charge for which they were convicted, though any sentence would likely be much lower and would be imposed by the judge based on a range of factors.\n\nWhen the charges were brought in 2022, the U.S. Justice Department called the case an example of its commitment to hold accountable people who distort and defraud U.S. financial markets.\n\nThe trial centered on the implosion of Hwang's family office Archegos, which inflicted $10 billion in losses at global banks and, according to prosecutors, and caused more than $100 billion in shareholder losses at companies in its portfolio. Prosecutors said Hwang's actions harmed U.S. financial markets as well as ordinary investors, causing significant losses to banks, market participants and Archegos employees. Hwang secretly amassed outsized stakes in multiple companies without actually holding their stock, according to prosecutors. Hwang lied to banks about the size of the derivative positions of Archegos in order to borrow billions of dollars that he and his deputies then used to artificially inflate the underlying stocks, prosecutors said.\n\nHalligan was accused by prosecutors of lying to banks and enabling the criminal scheme.\n\nDuring closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Thomas told jurors, \"By 2021, the defendants' lies and manipulation had ensnared nearly a dozen stocks and half of Wall Street in a $100 billion fraud, a fraud that came crashing down in a matter of days.\"\n\nHwang's defense team painted the indictment as the \"most aggressive open market manipulation case\" ever brought by U.S. prosecutors.

The spectacular collapse left global banks nursing $10 billion in losses and, according to prosecutors, caused more than $100 billion in shareholder losses at companies in its portfolio.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Thomas told jurors that Hwang manipulated stocks and worked with his deputy, Patrick Halligan, to lie to the banks they traded with.\n\n\"By 2021, the defendants' lies and manipulation had ensnared nearly a dozen stocks and half of Wall Street in a $100 billion fraud, a fraud that came crashing down in a matter of days,\" Thomas said during closing arguments on Monday.\n\nProsecutors have accused Hwang of secretly amassing outsized stakes in multiple companies without actually holding their stock. Hwang lied to banks about the size of Archegos' derivative positions to borrow billions of dollars that he and his deputies then used to inflate the underlying stocks, according to prosecutors.\n\n\"Bill Hwang was a billionaire and yet he risked nearly everything because he wanted more: more money, more success, more power,\" prosecutor Alexandra Rothman said during opening statements.\n\nHwang, 60, has pleaded not guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and 10 counts of fraud and market manipulation. His lawyers have said the case is the \"most aggressive open market manipulation case ever\" brought by prosecutors.\n\nHalligan, 47, has pleaded not guilty to fraud and racketeering conspiracy.\n\nIf convicted, they face maximum sentences of 20 years in prison on each charge, though any sentence would likely be much lower and would be imposed by the judge based on a range of factors.\n\nRobert Frenchman, an attorney who has defended clients in market manipulation cases, said that while the prosecution's theory is an \"unorthodox\" one, former Archegos insiders who testified during the trial \"have been very effective in telling a troubling story about lying by Archegos.\"\n\nWitnesses testified about Archegos lying about the positions it held, the concentration of its portfolio and the extent of its borrowings, Frenchman said.\n\nArchegos head trader William Tomita and Chief Risk Officer Scott Becker testified after pleading guilty to related charges and agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which brought the case, Hwang's positions eclipsed those of the companies' largest investors, driving up stock prices. At its peak, prosecutors said Archegos had $36 billion in assets and $160 billion of exposure to equities.\n\nWhen stock prices in March 2021 fell, the banks demanded additional deposits, which Archegos could not do. The banks then sold the stocks backing Hwang's swaps, wiping out $100 million in value for shareholders and $40 billion at the banks, including $5.5 billion for Credit Suisse, now part of UBS , and $2.9 billion for Nomura Holdings.\n\nHwang's attorney Barry Berke told jurors during opening statements that his client staked his own cash on companies he believed in deeply, trading like he was prepared to lose it all.\n\n\"The reason he did it was because he had the courage of his convictions,\" Berke said.\n\nHalligan's attorney, Mary Mulligan, said her client was not a risk-taker, but a bean counter who saw the firm's financial position as solid.\n\nThe banks that Archegos traded with knew the risks and kept trading with the firm anyway to chase profit, Mulligan said.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York;

Hwang and his deputy Patrick Halligan face charges of racketeering conspiracy, fraud, and market manipulation, accused of inflating stock prices and deceiving banks.\n\nA jury in Manhattan federal court commenced deliberations on Tuesday in the criminal case against Sung Kook \"Bill\" Hwang, the founder of Archegos Capital Management, who stands accused of manipulating stock prices before his firm's dramatic 2021 collapse. Prosecutors and defense lawyers delivered their closing arguments on Monday for Hwang and his deputy, co-defendant Patrick Halligan.\n\nHwang's lawyer argued that the prosecution had criminalized aggressive but legal trading tactics, while a federal prosecutor countered with claims that Hwang and Halligan unlawfully inflated stock prices and misled banks about Archegos' holdings. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein provided jurors with legal instructions before deliberations began.\n\nHwang, aged 60, has pleaded not guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and ten counts of fraud and market manipulation. Halligan, 47, has similarly pleaded not guilty to fraud and racketeering conspiracy. If found guilty, they could face up to 20 years in prison for each charge, although the actual sentences may be lower based on various factors determined by the judge. The trial highlights the extraordinary collapse of Archegos, which led to global banks incurring billions in losses and shareholders suffering over $100 billion in damages.\n\nProsecutors allege that Hwang accumulated large stakes in multiple companies covertly without owning their stock, deceived banks about Archegos' holdings, and used borrowed funds to inflate stock prices. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, Hwang's leveraged positions outstripped those of companies' biggest investors, driving up stock values significantly. At its zenith, prosecutors said, Archegos held $36 billion in assets and $160 billion in stock exposure.\n\nThe crisis peaked in March 2021 when falling stock prices led banks to demand more deposits from Archegos, which the firm couldn't provide. Consequently, banks sold the stocks backing Hwang's swaps, erasing $100 billion in shareholder value and causing billions in losses for several banks, notably $5.5 billion for Credit Suisse and $2.9 billion for Nomura Holdings.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archegos_Capital_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Archegos Capital Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market manipulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hwang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Hwang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Hellerstein", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Hellerstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomura_Holdings", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nomura Holdings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit Suisse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Offshore_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Offshore Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_06_09_904154.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715901", "eventUri": "eng-9715901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

Halligan's attorney, Mary Mulligan, said her client was not a risk-taker, but a bean counter who saw the firm's financial position as solid.\n\nThe banks Archegos traded with knew the risks and kept trading with the firm anyway to chase profit, Mulligan said.\n\nIf convicted, the men face maximum sentences of 20 years on each charge, though any sentence would likely be much lower and would be imposed by the judge based on a range of factors.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Noeleen Walder and Matthew Lewis)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market manipulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archegos_Capital_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Archegos Capital Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hwang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Hwang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derivative (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomura_Holdings", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nomura Holdings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit Suisse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715901", "eventUri": "eng-9715901", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 237, "textEnd": 243}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Halligan, 47, pleaded not guilty to fraud and racketeering conspiracy. If convicted, they face maximum sentences of 20 years in prison on each charge, though any sentence would likely be much lower and would be imposed by the judge based on a range of factors. The trial, which began in May, centers on the implosion of Archegos - a spectacular collapse that left global banks nursing billions in losses and, according to prosecutors, caused more than $100 billion in shareholder losses at companies in its portfolio. Prosecutors have accused Hwang of secretly amassing outsized stakes in multiple companies without actually holding their stock. They have said Hwang lied to banks about the size of Archegos' derivative positions to borrow billions of dollars that he and his deputies then used to inflate the underlying stocks. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which brought the case, Hwang's positions eclipsed those of the companies' largest investors, driving up stock prices. At its peak, prosecutors said Archegos had $36 billion in assets and $160 billion of exposure to equities. When stock prices fell in March 2021, the banks demanded additional deposits, which Archegos could not make. The banks then sold the stocks backing Hwang's swaps, wiping out $100 million in value for shareholders and $40 billion at the banks, including $5.5 billion for Credit Suisse, now part of UBS, and $2.9 billion for Nomura Holdings.", "source": {"uri": "money.usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@money.usnews.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "crime@money.usnews.com", "name": "crime", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hwang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Hwang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Hellerstein", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Hellerstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market manipulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomura_Holdings", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nomura Holdings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derivative (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit Suisse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/1231a67/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F1f%2F30773d0f3e5c0d44318ae9365c6f8c%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK680CC%3A12024-07-09T100529Z_1_LYNXMPEK680CC_RTROPTP_3_ARCHEGOS-FRAUD.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715901", "eventUri": "eng-9715901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

He is being tried alongside former chief financial officer Patrick Halligan, who is charged with three counts including wire fraud.\n\nJurors are expected to begin their deliberations on Tuesday. If convicted, Hwang and Halligan could face years behind bars.\n\nOver the course of the trial, jurors heard testimony from Archegos' former head of risk Scott Becker and former head trader William Tomita, both of who have pleaded guilty to fraud charges.\n\nTomita told the jury that he had been ordered by Hwang to lie to banks about the concentrated positions within the fund's portfolio, which had been amassed using equity swaps that obscure the buyer's identity.\n\nTranscripts of calls with big investment banks showed Archegos' senior staff were \"working together to actively mislead counterparties\", Thomas said, adding that the firm was built on a \"culture of deception\".\n\n\"You have seen the Bloomberg [terminal] messages where Hwang directs his traders to move prices,\" he added. \"What happened here was fraud.\"\n\n\"No one could see that Archegos was placing simultaneous orders at multiple brokers,\" Thomas said, claiming that this was \"a little bit like sending two different people to an auction to bid on the same [item]\".\n\nBerke said the case had only been brought because \"two, three adverse events\" in March 2021 had led to a sell-off in some of Archegos' holdings, prompting unexpected margin calls from the fund's lenders.\n\nHwang \"made a long-term commitment\" to the stocks in question, Berke added, and the large stakes he built were \"a reflection of his conviction\".\n\n\"He invested because he believed in those stocks,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Discovery, CNN's parent company). His positions were so large that when the stocks started falling, it had a seismic effect on the market.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the collapse of Archegos (pronounced ar-KAY-gos) cost shareholders $100 billion and left major banks with $10 billion in losses.\n\nHwang and his CFO, Patrick Halligan, were later charged with racketeering conspiracy and securities fraud. And on Tuesday, after a two-month trial in New York federal court, the case was handed over to a jury that will decide their fate.\n\nThere are two official versions of the Archegos saga that emerged from the trial.\n\nProsecutors say that the firm used financial instruments called \"total return swaps\" to gain exposure to stocks without actually owning them (a legal but controversial strategy), all while lying to the banks it was borrowing from (not legal) to conceal its massive positions and artificially inflating the stocks' value (also not legal).\n\nHwang's attorneys counter that Archegos' aggressive trades were actually commonplace and perfectly legal, and that he believed in the stocks he was buying. It can't be a pump-and-dump scheme if the investor never dumps the shares, after all. What happened to Hwang and his firm was an aggressive bet that went south due to a perfect storm of market movements that left the firm unable to meet margin calls from its lenders.\n\nThat forced the banks to sell Hwang's holdings, which caused the stocks' value to plummet, and the chaos to ensue.\n\nIf found guilty, Hwang and Halligan could face as much as 20 years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines.\n\nThe details of the Archegos trial may appear arcane to outsiders. Even the judge admonished prosecutors for \"boring the jury to tears,\" according to Bloomberg.\n\nBut the Archegos episode is one of the more significant white-collar cases to emerge since the financial crisis.\n\nThe case has shown the world, once again, what happens when two giant market risks collide in a novel way, Josh Naftalis, a former prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, told me.\n\nBefore Archegos, market watchers knew unregulated family offices were a problem, and they knew that swaps going unreported was a problem. \"But I don't think anyone put two and two together to say you could just use these two and light a dumpster on fire,\" said Naftalis, now with the law firm Pallas Partners.\n\nRegardless of the verdict, the case also underscores the massive risks that Wall Street megabanks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley continue to pile on, said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of the non-profit Better Markets, in an interview.\n\nEven if Wang is convicted, he said, there's another culprit in the saga getting off easy: the taxpayer-backed banks that enabled the trading in the first place.\n\n\"Fifteen years after the global financial crash, we still have gross under-regulation of non-banks, and we have Wall Street megabanks engaged in high-risk activities that aren't properly regulated,\" Kelleher told me. \"We still have a long, long way to go.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n\nIn lower Manhattan, a jury is now weighing a case against a little-known investor who made it big, lost everything, and briefly brought Wall Street to its knees.\n\nBut the story of Bill Hwang and his trading firm's colossal failure is more than a rags-to-riches-to-rags tale -- it is also a giant red flag about the vulnerabilities of the financial system that persist more than 15 years after Wall Street's everyday dark arts ravaged the global economy.\n\nHere's the deal: In March of 2021, as most of us were lining up for Covid vaccines, Bill Hwang's so-called family office -- an unregulated firm that works like a hedge fund -- imploded in a matter of days, sparking a brief but acute freakout in financial markets.\n\nSeemingly without anyone noticing, Hwang had managed to amass huge positions in a handful of companies -- including ViacomCBS, Tencent and Discovery (now Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN's parent company). His positions were so large that when the stocks started falling, it had a seismic effect on the market.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the collapse of Archegos (pronounced ar-KAY-gos) cost shareholders $100 billion and left major banks with $10 billion in losses.\n\nHwang and his CFO, Patrick Halligan, were later charged with racketeering conspiracy and securities fraud. And on Tuesday, after a two-month trial in New York federal court, the case was handed over to a jury that will decide their fate.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThere are two official versions of the Archegos saga that emerged from the trial.\n\nProsecutors say that the firm used financial instruments called \"total return swaps\" to gain exposure to stocks without actually owning them (a legal but controversial strategy), all while lying to the banks it was borrowing from (not legal) to conceal its massive positions and artificially inflating the stocks' value (also not legal).\n\nHwang's attorneys counter that Archegos' aggressive trades were actually commonplace and perfectly legal, and that he believed in the stocks he was buying. It can't be a pump-and-dump scheme if the investor never dumps the shares, after all. What happened to Hwang and his firm was an aggressive bet that went south due to a perfect storm of market movements that left the firm unable to meet margin calls from its lenders.\n\nThat forced the banks to sell Hwang's holdings, which caused the stocks' value to plummet, and the chaos to ensue.\n\nIf found guilty, Hwang and Halligan could face as much as 20 years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines.\n\nBig picture\n\nThe details of the Archegos trial may appear arcane to outsiders. Even the judge admonished prosecutors for \"boring the jury to tears,\" according to Bloomberg.\n\nBut the Archegos episode is one of the more significant white-collar cases to emerge since the financial crisis.\n\nThe case has shown the world, once again, what happens when two giant market risks collide in a novel way, Josh Naftalis, a former prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, told me.\n\nBefore Archegos, market watchers knew unregulated family offices were a problem, and they knew that swaps going unreported was a problem. \"But I don't think anyone put two and two together to say you could just use these two and light a dumpster on fire,\" said Naftalis, now with the law firm Pallas Partners.\n\nRegardless of the verdict, the case also underscores the massive risks that Wall Street megabanks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley continue to pile on, said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of the non-profit Better Markets, in an interview.\n\nEven if Wang is convicted, he said, there's another culprit in the saga getting off easy: the taxpayer-backed banks that enabled the trading in the first place.\n\n\"Fifteen years after the global financial crash, we still have gross under-regulation of non-banks, and we have Wall Street megabanks engaged in high-risk activities that aren't properly regulated,\" Kelleher told me. \"We still have a long, long way to go.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "allison_morrow@cnn.com", "name": "Allison Morrow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hwang", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Hwang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lower Manhattan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Both will be sentenced at a later date.\n\nRelatively unknown outside financial districts in New York and Hong Kong, Hwang rose to international prominence in the spring of 2021, when his family office Archegos was revealed to be behind a fire sale of big stocks including Discovery, Viacom and Tencent.\n\nThe fund had managed to amass large stakes in specific companies by buying equity swaps, a method which at the time allowed the purchaser to conceal their identity.\n\n\"No participant in the market could track the trading back to a single buyer,\" assistant US attorney Andrew Thomas said in closing arguments on Monday. \"No one could see that Archegos was placing simultaneous orders at multiple brokers.\"\n\nOnce banks that had lent to Hwang began to realise that Archegos's portfolio consisted of outsized bets in a handful of companies, they demanded he deposit more funds into his accounts to cover the risk, and unwound their positions when he failed to pay up.\n\nThe ensuing sell-off left Archegos's lenders -- including Credit Suisse, Nomura, Morgan Stanley and UBS -- with combined losses of more than $10bn, and prompted a revamp of due diligence processes at some of Wall

The $36 billion investment fund's downfall has become a landmark case in financial fraud.\n\nJurors were presented with arguments from both sides, focusing on the spectacular collapse of Archegos, which left global financial institutions grappling with $10 billion in losses and inflicted over $100 billion in losses on shareholders of companies held by the fund. Hwang's attorney, Barry Berke, contended that a series of unforeseen events triggered the collapse, criticizing the criminalization of aggressive but lawful trading practices.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Thomas accused Hwang of manipulating stock prices and deceiving banks, leading to a massive $100 billion fraud.

That includes the often dramatic testimony of two top executives who turned against Hwang and a parade of managers from the banks that lost billions working with him.\n\nThough closely watched on Wall Street, the long trial got so granular at times that the seasoned jurist overseeing it, 90-year-old US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, sometimes lost his patience.\n\n\"I think you're wasting our time,\" he told the government at one point, suggesting the testimony it was eliciting from an Archegos staffer was \"marginal.\" He later told the defense it was \"boring the jury to tears.\"\n\nThe panel of New Yorkers, who the judge has wryly said would be getting a crash course in \"Finance 101,\" will weigh a raft of complicated exhibits and reams of testimony. The jurors must decide whether Hwang illegally pumped up the price of stocks he was investing in and duped such sophisticated players as UBS Group AG, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. about the sky-high risk to which he was exposing them.\n\nIn the end, the banks' role as Archegos' trading counterparties cost them more than $10 billion when the family office imploded in 2021, obliterating Hwang's own, sudden $36 billion wealth and contributing to the failure of Credit Suisse Group AG. The defense has argued it was an unforeseeable \"black swan\" event and that Hwang was just an aggressive investor who believed in his holdings.\n\n\"This is more complex than many other cases, and that's an issue,\" UCLA law professor James Park said in an interview. \"It will be challenging for the jury to distinguish between trading meant to artificially manipulate the price and trading of a stock you think is valuable.\"\n\nThe jurors, most of whom don't have any financial background, will now determine Hwang's fate. The 60-year-old protege of hedge fund billionaire Julian Robertson is facing as many as 20 years in prison on each count if he is convicted, although he would probably serve those terms concurrently. Former Archegos chief financial officer Patrick Halligan is also on trial and has pleaded not guilty to fraud and racketeering conspiracy.\n\nOne by one, bank insiders, former Archegos employees and market experts testified during the trial about the circumstances of Archegos' failure. Prosecutors elicited testimony that Hwang amassed huge positions in a handful of public companies using swaps and engaged in manipulative trading practices to artificially jack up the stocks. They claim he directed Archegos executives to lie to the banks to increase the family office's credit limits and fuel his prolific trading.\n\nOn cross-examination and during the presentation of their own case, Hwang's lawyers tried to show that many of the tactics the government calls nefarious were common industry practices. They pushed back on testimony about their client's care in keeping the concentration of his positions secret, probing witnesses on the importance of not tipping one's hand to short sellers and other competing investors.\n\nThe government's case was anchored by two cooperating witnesses. One was former chief risk officer Scott Becker, who testified that Archegos lied again and again to the banks about its positions. The other, former Archegos head trader William Tomita, spent about two weeks on the stand and told the jurors how he manipulated stock prices at Hwang's direction. He seemed especially effective at putting financial terms into plain English for the jury.\n\nStill, the defense appeared to land several blows during cross-examination. It tried to cast doubt on Becker's credibility, reminding him of a text he had sent wishing Halligan would die in a plane crash. As for Tomita, Hwang's lawyer Barry Berke told the jury during his closing that the trader had said \"I don't recall\" 451 times during cross.\n\nThrough it all, the challenge for the lawyers has been turning the sometimes arcane subject matter into digestible information for the jury. Some jurors appeared to nod off during the more detailed testimony, while others doodled on notepads or wrapped themselves in blankets to counter the air conditioning.\n\nOverall, though, they appeared alert and engaged, following share price charts on their individual screens and often asking the judge to keep the trial going when given the choice to finish for the day. One alternate juror shook his head when a spreadsheet was presented showing that Archegos suffered a $2.85 billion loss in a single day because the share price of ViacomCBS dropped $10.\n\nWhen the testimony grew too dense for his liking, the judge warned the lawyers that the jury was fading. But that periodic inattention needn't be fatal, according to Columbia Law School Professor Daniel Richman.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the fact that jurors looked bored is not necessarily bad for the government, so long as the jury doesn't hold it against them,\" Richman said. \"And it's less likely to do so if the government succeeded in its summation to explain how the dry spots really relate to the most interesting parts, to support a narrative.\"\n\nMost of the testimony was about the daily work of Wall Street. Clearly mindful of the need to make it real for the jury, one witness for the defense, investing expert Sunil Wahal, used a household staple to explain variations in algorithmic trading.\n\n\"I like whole yogurt. My kids like Greek yogurt. My wife likes low-fat yogurt,\" Wahal told the jurors. \"These are all algorithms. They are just different.\"\n\n--With assistance from Bob Van Voris and Chris Dolmetsch.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Prosecutors said Hwang and Halligan lied to banks in order to obtain billions of dollars that they used to artificially pump up the stock prices of multiple publicly traded companies. The trial began in May.\n\nThe Archegos meltdown sent shock waves across Wall Street and drew regulatory scrutiny on three continents.\n\nHwang, 60, had pleaded not guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy, three counts of fraud and seven counts of market manipulation. Hwang was convicted on 10 of the 11 counts.\n\nHalligan, 47, had pleaded not guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and two counts of fraud. Halligan was the chief financial officer at Archegos. Halligan was found guilty on all counts he faced.\n\nThey now face maximum sentences of 20 years in prison on each charge for which they were convicted, though any sentence would likely be much lower and would be imposed by the judge based on a range of factors.\n\nWhen the charges were brought in 2022, the U.S. Justice Department called the case an example of its commitment to hold accountable people who distort and defraud U.S. financial markets.\n\nThe trial centered on the implosion of Hwang's family office Archegos, which inflicted $10 billion in losses at global banks and, according to prosecutors, and caused more than $100 billion in shareholder losses at companies in its portfolio. Prosecutors said Hwang's actions harmed U.S. financial markets as well as ordinary investors, causing significant losses to banks, market participants and Archegos employees.\n\nHwang secretly amassed outsized stakes in multiple companies without actually holding their stock, according to prosecutors. Hwang lied to banks about the size of the derivative positions of Archegos in order to borrow billions of dollars that he and his deputies then used to artificially inflate the underlying stocks, prosecutors said.\n\nHalligan was accused by prosecutors of lying to banks and enabling the criminal scheme.\n\nDuring closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Thomas told jurors, \"By 2021, the defendants' lies and manipulation had ensnared nearly a dozen stocks and half of Wall Street in a $100 billion fraud, a fraud that came crashing down in a matter of days.\"\n\nHwang's defense team painted the indictment as the \"most aggressive open market manipulation case\" ever brought by U.S. prosecutors. Hwang's attorney Barry Berke told jurors in his closing argument that prosecutors criminalized aggressive but legal trading methods.\n\nArchegos head trader William Tomita and Chief Risk Officer Scott Becker testified as prosecution witnesses after pleading guilty to related charges and agreeing to cooperate in the case.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which brought the case, Hwang's positions eclipsed those of the companies' largest investors, driving up stock prices. At its peak, prosecutors said Archegos had $36 billion in assets and $160 billion of exposure to equities.\n\nWhen stock prices fell in March 2021, the banks demanded additional deposits, which Archegos could not make. The banks then sold the stocks backing Hwang's swaps, wiping out an alleged $100 billion in value for shareholders and billions at the banks, including $5.5 billion for Credit Suisse, now part of UBS, and $2.9 billion for Nomura Holdings.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy; Editing by Will Dunham)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market manipulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archegos_Capital_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Archegos Capital Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assistant United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomura_Holdings", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nomura Holdings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derivative (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit Suisse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Offshore_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Offshore Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715901", "eventUri": "eng-9715901", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 25, "textEnd": 32}], "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 458340794, "relevance": 2}

Its portfolio grew from $10 billion to $160 billion.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Here's what we know July Fourth festivities in Western New York: Fireworks, music and food\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Alexandra Rothman told jurors at the start of the case that Hwang, who was a billionaire, \"wanted to be a legend on Wall Street\" and engaged in a scheme involving trades of stock derivatives to secretly build extraordinarily large positions in just a few companies.\n\nHwang's attorney, Barry Berke, said in his opening statement that his client \"didn't live the life of a billionaire\" and didn't make any misrepresentations to any banks about his business.\n\nIn a closing argument earlier this week, Berke told the jury that his client was innocent, saying, \"Mr. Hwang bet big on stocks he believed in. That is not a crime.\"\n\nThe indictment said the investment public did not know Archegos had come to dominate the trading and stock ownership of multiple companies because it used securities that had no public disclosure requirement. At one point Hwang and his firm secretly controlled over 50 percent of the shares of ViacomCBS, prosecutors said.\n\nThe risky maneuvers, however, made the firm's portfolio vulnerable to price fluctuations in a handful of stocks.\n\nMargin calls in late March 2021 wiped out more than $100 billion in market value in just days, the indictment said.\n\nNearly a dozen companies as well as banks and prime brokers duped by Archegos lost billions as a result, according to the indictment.\n\nThe jury also convicted the company's former financial officer, Patrick Halligan.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

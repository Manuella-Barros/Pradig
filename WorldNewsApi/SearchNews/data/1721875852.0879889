{"id": 239767608, "title": "Yankees' Giancarlo Stanton Suffers Hamstring Injury vs. Braves; DH to Undergo Imaging", "text": "New York Yankees designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton exited the team's matchup against the Atlanta Braves early on Saturday night while dealing with left hamstring tightness, the Yankees announced on social media. New York also confirmed that Stanton will undergo imaging on Sunday. Before exiting the game, Stanton was 1-for-2 with a run scored, continuing a 10-game hit streak. During the fourth inning as Stanton rounded third base heading for home, he appeared to be grimacing while running the basepath. It's not clear whether he injured his hamstring during that play or before, but the pain was enough for him to end his night earlier than expected. Stanton has dealt with a handful of lower-body injuries in his career, including two in the last two seasons. He suffered a strained hamstring last April as well as a calf strain and Achilles tendonitis in 2022. He was limited to 110 games in 2022 and 101 games last season. The Yankees are hoping Stanton's injury is nothing serious and the power hitter will be able to return to the field shortly to continue what has been a strong season thus far. Stanton is top-10 in the majors in home runs this year with 18 and has 45 RBI with a .244 batting average. He's on pace to surpass his home run totals from the last two seasons and will dramatically improve his batting average from 2022 and 2023 if stays near where it is now. He's helped lead New York to the top record in the American League at 51-27 this year and the Yankees are hoping to continue their strong play through the second half of the season.", "summary": "New York Yankees designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton exited the team's matchup against the Atlanta Braves early on Saturday night while dealing with left\u2026", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10125721-yankees-giancarlo-stanton-suffers-hamstring-injury-vs-braves-dh-to-undergo-imaging", "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/v1719106082/mi5crnzapgo5jsavxnwf.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:33:55", "author": "Andrew Peters", "authors": ["Andrew Peters"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.128}

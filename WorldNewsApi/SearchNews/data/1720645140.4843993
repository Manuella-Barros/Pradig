{"id": 231393170, "title": "The Fur Flies: \u2018Bark Air\u2019 Offers First Class Animal Amenities, Complete With Tasting Menu and Doggie Champagne", "text": "Dogs can now embark on a first-class flight, fully tailored to their needs, with Bark Air, a new private jet company that focuses on dog-first, human-second travel. Flights run between Los Angeles and New York, as well as NYC and London. Once someone books a flight, a concierge reaches out to learn everything about their pup, from their energy levels to their allergies. Josh Groban and his dog George, a Westie, were two of the first passengers to fly Bark Air, and, according to the company, other celebrities and their dogs have flown, too, though they declined to share names. On the flights, dogs are treated to a tasting menu, doggie champagne (aka organic bone broth, which is said to help their ears adjust to altitude changes), blankets with calming pheromones, earmuffs and more. Prices are in line with the steep cost of private jet travel: $6,000 one way from New York to L.A. and $8,000 from New York to London. \u201cEvery little thing is thought of for the dog, both from a comfort standpoint and a safety standpoint,\u201d says Dave Stangle, vp brand marketing. He adds, \u201cAll our flight attendants are trained in dog and canine CPR and de-escalation.\u201d Stangle and BarkBox CEO Matt Meeker have been discussing the possibility of flights for dogs for more than 10 years, as Meeker searched for a way to travel with his massive Great Dane without having to crate him and put him in a plane\u2019s cargo hold. Entertainment figures aren\u2019t the only ones who have expressed interest in flying. Brands and high-end travel agencies have also reached out about the first-class flights, as well as \u201cevery influencer in the world,\u201d the marketing exec jokes. But the company is in no rush to get everyone on board as soon as possible. \u201cReally, what we\u2019re trying to do is, let\u2019s just get this experience down better and better every single time,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd then when we\u2019re ready to engage with big brands or celebrities or anything like that, then we\u2019ve got a rock-solid product, and we\u2019ve done this a bunch of times.\u201d Once the dogs and their humans arrive at the airport prior to their flight, the owner is treated to a chef-prepared meal while their four-legged friend gets to know their fellow passengers. How the dogs get along with each other helps the airline organize the best seating chart, putting more playful pups together toward the front of the plane and calmer ones toward the back. \u201cThe dogs are free to sit right next to you on the plane,\u201d says Stangle. \u201cThey can wander about and mingle with other dogs if they want. They can take a nap with you. We think dogs should have the amount of freedom that people have on planes because, ultimately, dogs are happier when they\u2019re right next to their person.\u201d In addition to the flights, Bark Air will send a free car service to pick up the dogs and people, as long as they are within a 30-mile radius of the airport. There are also cars waiting once the flights land at the final destination, complete with signs that have the dog\u2019s name instead of the human\u2019s. Bark Air launched with only two routes in an effort to connect a few of the longest distances that aren\u2019t practical \u2014 or even possible \u2014 to drive to with your dog, like NYC and L.A. and NYC and London. However, it won\u2019t be long before the airline begins flying to other parts of the world. Come October, Bark Air will have flights from NYC to Paris for $8,500, and as of May 29, the company had 22,000 other suggestions for routes people want to see them expand to. As the fall months grow closer, Stangle shares they\u2019re likely going to add a route between New York and Florida because of the snowbirds who go south for the colder months. They\u2019re also interested in expanding to Chicago and Dallas, with the hope of eventually being able to fly between all of those cities, instead of mostly taking off from New York. The Bark Air team is aware of how expensive their flights are and aims to one day bring prices down to be more on par with \u2014 or even cheaper than \u2014 a regular first-class ticket. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to stop until it\u2019s as easy to fly with your dog as it is with your child and in a lot of cases probably easier,\u201d he notes, adding that they have a business plan for it but didn\u2019t want to expand on what it was at this time. As for their ultimate goal with Bark Air, Stangle says they want to redefine what \u201cdog-friendly\u201d truly means when it comes to travel. \u201cWe care about your dog,\u201d says Stangle. \u201cOur thought was, \u2018Why don\u2019t we go way over the top with how dog-friendly this is? Like, let\u2019s not even think about the human because if you make a dog happy, you will make that dog\u2019s parent happy.\u2019 The person was an afterthought, and we knew they would be happy.\u201d A version of this story first appeared in the June 5 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

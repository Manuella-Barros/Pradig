He'll be in the spotlight Sunday after team owner Chip Ganassi gave him permission to go to Iowa on Saturday to race in the Knoxville Nationals.\n\nHENDRICK PROBLEMS\n\nHendrick Motorsports teammates Johnson and Kasey Kahne both are on to backup cars after going into the wall during practice Saturday. Johnson also had to go to the backup car in June at Michigan after a practice mishap.\n\n\"You have to run so hard here that if the car slips it's around and gone,\" Johnson said. \"I ran a half a second faster today in practice than I did in qualifying yesterday. So, with the grill open and tires on low pressure and all that, especially these morning sessions with overcast clouds you just run so hard that when something happens, it's gone.\"\n\nQUALIFYING SWEEP\n\nFord vs. Chevrolet is always a matchup to watch in Michigan.

Keselowski is winless in 16 career Cup races at Michigan. He does have eight top-10 finishes.\n\n\"I'm not really known as a great qualifier, so maybe over time I've probably put a little less stock in qualifying,\" Keselowski said. \"But I can tell you that when I saw that we were going to win the pole those last few seconds of qualifying, it put chills down my body.

Earnhardt described some of the comments as \"hurtful\" on Thursday.\n\n\"It wasn't anything personal. He had his opinion the week before on driver salaries and driver ages and those things, and I don't know that anybody in the garage agreed with those either,\" Harvick said. \"There's definitely opinions on a lot of things.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nBROOKLYN, Mich. - Dale Earnhardt Jr. was racing for the win in a 1999 IROC event at Michigan.\n\nProblem was, his opponent was in no mood to let him pass.\n\n\"Dad drove to the bottom so I just went around a little bit higher and it stuck, and I got along his outside,\" the younger Earnhardt recalled. \"I was going by and he hit me.\"\n\nDale Earnhardt won that race over Earnhardt Jr. by 0.007 seconds on one of many memorable days at Michigan International Speedway for Earnhardt Jr., whose farewell tour is passing through the track this weekend. Earnhardt Jr. would go on to win Cup races at MIS in 2008 and 2012, and he'll try to add another victory Sunday in his final race at the venue before he retires at the end of this season.\n\nThose wins in '08 and '12 were Earnhardt Jr.'s only Cup victories from 2007-13. The latter snapped a 143-race losing streak. But his memories at Michigan extend further back than that.\n\nThe exciting IROC finish in '99 included some contact between Earnhardt Jr.'s car and his father's -- a fun story line if there ever was one. Later that year, Junior pulled away from Jeff Gordon -- who was at that point the two-time defending Cup champion -- for a win in a Busch Series race at Michigan.\n\n\"It seemed like only me and him were racing each other for the win. I was very proud of that because I thought he was the best in the sport at the time,\" Earnhardt Jr. said. \"It was like beating Jimmie Johnson if he came down to the Xfinity Series. So, that was a big deal for us.\"\n\nBy 2012, Earnhardt Jr. was no longer an up-and-comer in his mid-20s. His victory at the 2-mile Michigan track that year ended his long drought. He'd go on to win four more Cup races in 2014 and three in 2015.\n\nEarnhardt Jr. is winless over the past two seasons, and he has only four top-10 finishes this year. Over the past week, he has been involved in a bit of a back-and-forth with Kevin Harvick, who suggested Junior's inability to achieve more success has hindered the sport's growth.\n\nBut Earnhardt Jr. has been plenty competitive in Michigan over the years. In fact, only two active drivers -- Kurt Busch and Matt Kenseth -- have more Cup wins at MIS.\n\n\"We've got some really good memories here. It's been a fun track,\" Earnhardt Jr. said. \"There has been some conversation about the 1.5-mile tracks with the words 'cookie cutter' and all that. That's been a conversation for a couple of decades now. But this place here is, to me, the standard for the 1.5-mile or 2-mile race track. This place is so much fun to race on for a driver. It's a great race track.\"\n\nMore things to watch in Sunday's race:\n\nGoing for three\n\nKyle Larson is trying for a third straight Cup win at Michigan after victories this June and last August. He'll be in the spotlight Sunday after team owner Chip Ganassi gave him permission to go to Iowa on Saturday to race in the Knoxville Nationals.\n\nHendrick problems\n\nHendrick Motorsports teammates Johnson and Kasey Kahne both are on to backup cars after going into the wall during practice Saturday. Johnson also had to go to the backup car in June at Michigan after a practice mishap.\n\n\"You have to run so hard here that if the car slips it's around and gone,\" Johnson said. \"I ran a half a second faster today in practice than I did in qualifying yesterday. So, with the grill open and tires on low pressure and all that, especially these morning sessions with overcast clouds you just run so hard that when something happens, it's gone.\"\n\nQualifying sweep\n\nFord vs. Chevrolet is always a matchup to watch in Michigan. Larson won for Chevy in June, but Ford swept the top three spots in qualifying Friday, with Team Penske's Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano going 1-2. Harvick was third.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Over the past week, he has been involved in a bit of a back-and-forth with Kevin Harvick, who suggested Junior's inability to achieve more success has hindered the sport's growth.\n\nBut Earnhardt Jr. has been plenty competitive in Michigan over the years. In fact, only two active drivers -- Kurt Busch and Matt Kenseth -- have more Cup wins at MIS.\n\n\"We've got some really good memories here. It's been a fun track,\" Earnhardt Jr. said. \"There has been some conversation about the 1.5-mile tracks with the words 'cookie cutter' and all that. That's been a conversation for a couple of decades now. But this place here is, to me, the standard for the 1.5-mile or 2-mile race track. This place is so much fun to race on for a driver. It's a great race track.\"\n\nMore things to watch in Sunday's race:\n\nGOING FOR THREE\n\nKyle Larson is trying for a third straight Cup win at Michigan after victories this June and last August. He'll be in the spotlight Sunday after team owner Chip Ganassi gave him permission to go to Iowa on Saturday to race in the Knoxville Nationals.\n\nHENDRICK PROBLEMS\n\nHendrick Motorsports teammates Johnson and Kasey Kahne both are on to backup cars after going into the wall during practice Saturday. Johnson also had to go to the backup car in June at Michigan after a practice mishap.\n\n\"You have to run so hard here that if the car slips it's around and gone,\" Johnson said. \"I ran a half a second faster today in practice than I did in qualifying yesterday. So, with the grill open and tires on low pressure and all that, especially these morning sessions with overcast clouds you just run so hard that when something happens, it's gone.\"\n\nQUALIFYING SWEEP\n\nFord vs. Chevrolet is always a matchup to watch in Michigan. Larson won for Chevy in June, but Ford swept the top three spots in qualifying Friday, with Team Penske's Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano going 1-2. Harvick was third.", "timeCrawl": "21:56:00", "sim": 0.8588235378265381, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8848057", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "id": 384, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "id": 392, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "id": 393, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "id": 1249, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

(AP) -- For Brad Keselowski, any victory at his home state's track is special.\n\nEven if it's only in qualifying.\n\nKeselowski won the pole Friday for this weekend's NASCAR Cup Series race, putting himself in good position to try for an elusive victory at Michigan International Speedway. Keselowski is winless in 16 career Cup races at Michigan. He does have eight top-10 finishes.\n\n\"I'm not really known as a great qualifier, so maybe over time I've probably put a little less stock in qualifying,\" Keselowski said. \"But I can tell you that when I saw that we were going to win the pole those last few seconds of qualifying, it put chills down my body. It's a great feeling. It's a special track for me to have any kind of success at.\"\n\nKeselowski's pole was his 14th on the Cup Series and first at Michigan. It was his second this year.\n\nJoey Logano was second, giving Team Penske a 1-2 showing in qualifying for Sunday's race. Kevin Harvick -- another Ford driver -- was third.\n\nKeselowski took the pole with a lap of 35.451 seconds (203.097 mph) in his No. 2 Ford. Logano was close behind at 35.457.\n\n\"Missed it by seven thousandths,\" Logano said. \"So close. But we've got to be proud of the effort that we put in as a team.\"\n\nKeselowski, who is from Rochester Hills, won at Michigan on the Nationwide Series but has never done so at the Cup level.\n\n\"Any success you have at your home track is right there with having success in the biggest races of the year,\" Keselowski said.\n\nOther noteworthy developments at MIS:\n\nEARNHARDT AND HARVICK\n\nHarvick talked a bit more about his comments from earlier in the week about Dale Earnhardt Jr. Harvick suggested on SiriusXM that NASCAR's growth has fallen short of its potential because Earnhardt -- the most popular driver -- hasn't been successful enough. Earnhardt described some of the comments as \"hurtful\" on Thursday.\n\n\"It wasn't anything personal. He had his opinion the week before on driver salaries and driver ages and those things, and I don't know that anybody in the garage agreed with those either,\" Harvick said. \"There's definitely opinions on a lot of things. There's nothing personal, and I didn't take anything that he said the week before personally either.\"\n\nEarnhardt said last weekend at Watkins Glen that there's been \"a major shift in how much drivers are getting paid.\" He said newcomers are making a fifth to a 10th of what veterans had been getting.\n\nEarnhardt said Friday he'd like to have a conversation with Harvick.\n\n\"I would certainly like to clear it up, but just probably between ourselves,\" Earnhardt said.\n\nKAHNE'S OUTLOOK\n\nKasey Kahne, who is being replaced next year by Hendrick Motorsports in the No. 5 Chevrolet, said the vibe was good within the team Friday.\n\n\"It was the first time I had seen my guys since the news,\" he said.\n\nKahne said he still wants to be in the Cup Series.\n\n\"I really think that I can come up with something good and come up with something that will be fun to be a part of and also try to work hard to make that team better than it's ever been and myself better than I've been,\" Kahne said. \"I still have that mindset and I really hope that something works out to where I can be in a strong car next year and enjoy racing in this series.\"", "timeCrawl": "03:41:00", "sim": 0.8549019694328308, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8739338", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "id": 392, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "id": 393, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "id": 1249, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

"isDuplicate": false, "body": "BROOKLYN, Mich. -- Dale Earnhardt Jr. was racing for the win in a 1999 IROC event at Michigan.\n\nProblem was, his opponent was in no mood to let him pass.\n\n\"Dad drove to the bottom so I just went around a little bit higher and it stuck, and I got along his outside,\" the younger Earnhardt recalled. \"I was going by and he hit me.\"\n\nDale Earnhardt won that race over Earnhardt Jr. by 0.007 seconds on one of many memorable days at Michigan International Speedway for Earnhardt Jr., whose farewell tour is passing through the track this weekend. Earnhardt Jr. would go on to win Cup races at MIS in 2008 and 2012, and he'll try to add another victory today in his final race at the venue before he retires at the end of this season.\n\nThose wins in '08 and '12 were Earnhardt Jr.'s only Cup victories from 2007-13. The latter snapped a 143-race losing streak. But his memories at Michigan extend further back than that.\n\nThe exciting IROC finish in '99 included some contact between Earnhardt Jr.'s car and his father's -- a fun story line if there ever was one. Later that year, Junior pulled away from Jeff Gordon -- who was at that point the two-time defending Cup champion -- for a victory in a Busch Series race at Michigan.\n\n\"It seemed like only me and him were racing each other for the win. I was very proud of that because I thought he was the best in the sport at the time,\" Earnhardt Jr. said. \"It was like beating Jimmie Johnson if he came down to the Xfinity Series. So, that was a big deal for us.\"\n\nBy 2012, Earnhardt Jr. was no longer an up-and-comer in his mid-20s. His victory at the 2-mile Michigan track that year ended his long drought. He'd go on to win four more Cup races in 2014 and three in 2015.\n\nEarnhardt Jr. is winless over the past two seasons, and he has only four top-10 finishes this year. Over the past week, he has been involved in a bit of a back-and-forth with Kevin Harvick, who suggested Junior's inability to achieve more success has hindered the sport's growth.\n\nBut Earnhardt Jr. has been plenty competitive in Michigan over the years. In fact, only two active drivers -- Kurt Busch and Matt Kenseth -- have more Cup wins at MIS.\n\n\"We've got some really good memories here. It's been a fun track,\" Earnhardt Jr. said. \"There has been some conversation about the 1.5-mile tracks with the words 'cookie cutter' and all that. That's been a conversation for a couple of decades now. But this place here is, to me, the standard for the 1.5-mile or 2-mile race track. This place is so much fun to race on for a driver. It's a great race track.\"\n\nHere are some additional things to watch in today's race.\n\nKyle Larson is trying for a third consecutive Cup victory at Michigan after victories this June and last August. He'll be in the spotlight today after team owner Chip Ganassi gave him permission to go to Iowa on Saturday to race in the Knoxville Nationals.\n\nHendrick Motorsports teammates Johnson and Kasey Kahne both are on to backup cars after going into the wall during practice Saturday. Johnson also had to go to the backup car in June at Michigan after a practice mishap.\n\n\"You have to run so hard here that if the car slips, it's around and gone,\" Johnson said. \"I ran a half a second faster today in practice than I did in qualifying yesterday. So, with the grill open and tires on low pressure and all that, especially these morning sessions with overcast clouds, you just run so hard that when something happens, it's gone.\"\n\nFord vs. Chevrolet is always a matchup to watch in Michigan. Larson won for Chevy in June, but Ford swept the top three spots in qualifying Friday, with Team Penske's Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano going 1-2. Harvick was third.\n\nWallace tops challenge\n\nDarrell Wallace Jr. made the most of his first NASCAR Truck Series race in three years, holding off a late challenge from Christopher Bell to win Saturday at Michigan International Speedway.\n\nWallace took the lead in his No. 99 Chevrolet with about 10 laps remaining in the 100-lap, 200-mile race. He had to contend with Austin Cindric and Bell toward the end, but Wallace was able to edge Bell by 0.18 seconds.\n\nKyle Busch finished third after winning the first two stages.\n\nWallace hadn't driven in a Truck race since 2014, when he won four times. He drove full time on the Xfinity Series in 2015 and 2016.\n\nHornish dominates\n\nLEXINGTON, Ohio -- Sam Hornish Jr. dominated in his home state to win the Xfinity Mid-Ohio Challenge on Saturday.\n\nHornish, from Defiance, Ohio, took the lead from rookie Daniel Hemric on lap 62 of 75 after the seventh caution at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course. He beat him by 1.335 seconds.\n\nRookie Matt Tifft, a Hinckley, Ohio, native was third, 2.373 seconds back of Hornish. James Davison and Andy Lally completed the top five.\n\nHornish led for 61 laps and avoided a 10-car pileup on lap 69 that resulted in the second red flag. There were also nine cautions.\n\nBlake Koch of Kaulig Racing from Akron, Ohio, won the first stage ahead of Brennan Poole. Hornish, who won the pole, easily took the second 20-lap stage by 4.645 seconds over Hemric.", "timeCrawl": "07:31:00", "sim": 0.8392156958580017, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8885215", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "id": 384, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "id": 392, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "id": 393, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "id": 694, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "id": 1249, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

(AP) -- For Brad Keselowski, any victory at his home state's track is special.\n\nEven if it's only in qualifying.\n\nKeselowski won the pole Friday for this weekend's NASCAR Cup Series race, putting himself in good position to try for an elusive victory at Michigan International Speedway. Keselowski is winless in 16 career Cup races at Michigan. He does have eight top-10 finishes.\n\n\"I'm not really known as a great qualifier, so maybe over time I've probably put a little less stock in qualifying,\" Keselowski said. \"But I can tell you that when I saw that we were going to win the pole those last few seconds of qualifying, it put chills down my body. It's a great feeling. It's a special track for me to have any kind of success at.\"\n\nKeselowski's pole was his 14th on the Cup Series and first at Michigan. It was his second this year.\n\nJoey Logano was second, giving Team Penske a 1-2 showing in qualifying for Sunday's race. Kevin Harvick -- another Ford driver -- was third.\n\nKeselowski took the pole with a lap of 35.451 seconds (203.097 mph) in his No. 2 Ford. Logano was close behind at 35.457.\n\n\"Missed it by seven thousandths,\" Logano said. \"So close. But we've got to be proud of the effort that we put in as a team.\"\n\nKeselowski, who is from Rochester Hills, won at Michigan on the Nationwide Series but has never done so at the Cup level.\n\n\"Any success you have at your home track is right there with having success in the biggest races of the year,\" Keselowski said.\n\nOther noteworthy developments at MIS:\n\nEARNHARDT AND HARVICK\n\nHarvick talked a bit more about his comments from earlier in the week about Dale Earnhardt Jr. Harvick suggested on SiriusXM that NASCAR's growth has fallen short of its potential because Earnhardt -- the most popular driver -- hasn't been successful enough. Earnhardt described some of the comments as \"hurtful\" on Thursday.\n\n\"It wasn't anything personal.

(AP) -- Dale Earnhardt Jr. was racing for the win in a 1999 IROC event at Michigan.\n\nProblem was, his opponent was in no mood to let him pass.\n\n\"Dad drove to the bottom so I just went around a little bit higher and it stuck, and I got along his outside,\" the younger Earnhardt recalled. \"I was going by and he hit me.\"\n\nDale Earnhardt won that race over Earnhardt Jr. by 0.007 seconds on one of many memorable days at Michigan International Speedway for Earnhardt Jr., whose farewell tour is passing through the track this weekend. Earnhardt Jr. would go on to win Cup races at MIS in 2008 and 2012, and he'll try to add another victory Sunday in his final race at the venue before he retires at the end of this season.\n\nSponsored Content: Sign up for a free webinar as the U.S. Trade and Development Agency and Small Business Administration explore the hybrid IT environment in government.\n\nThose wins in '08 and '12 were Earnhardt Jr.'s only Cup victories from 2007-13. The latter snapped a 143-race losing streak. But his memories at Michigan extend further back than that.\n\nThe exciting IROC finish in '99 included some contact between Earnhardt Jr.'s car and his father's -- a fun story line if there ever was one. Later that year, Junior pulled away from Jeff Gordon -- who was at that point the two-time defending Cup champion -- for a win in a Busch Series race at Michigan.\n\n\"It seemed like only me and him were racing each other for the win. I was very proud of that because I thought he was the best in the sport at the time,\" Earnhardt Jr. said. \"It was like beating Jimmie Johnson if he came down to the Xfinity Series. So, that was a big deal for us.\"\n\nBy 2012, Earnhardt Jr. was no longer an up-and-comer in his mid-20s. His victory at the 2-mile Michigan track that year ended his long drought. He'd go on to win four more Cup races in 2014 and three in 2015.\n\nEarnhardt Jr. is winless over the past two seasons, and he has only four top-10 finishes this year. Over the past week, he has been involved in a bit of a back-and-forth with Kevin Harvick, who suggested Junior's inability to achieve more success has hindered the sport's growth.\n\nBut Earnhardt Jr. has been plenty competitive in Michigan over the years. In fact, only two active drivers -- Kurt Busch and Matt Kenseth -- have more Cup wins at MIS.\n\nHouse minibus sets stage for fight over sequestration, civilian-defense parity\n\n\"We've got some really good memories here. It's been a fun track,\" Earnhardt Jr. said. \"There has been some conversation about the 1.5-mile tracks with the words 'cookie cutter' and all that. That's been a conversation for a couple of decades now. But this place here is, to me, the standard for the 1.5-mile or 2-mile race track. This place is so much fun to race on for a driver. It's a great race track.\"\n\nKyle Larson is trying for a third straight Cup win at Michigan after victories this June and last August. He'll be in the spotlight Sunday after team owner Chip Ganassi gave him permission to go to Iowa on Saturday to race in the Knoxville Nationals.\n\nHENDRICK PROBLEMS\n\nHendrick Motorsports teammates Johnson and Kasey Kahne both are on to backup cars after going into the wall during practice Saturday. Johnson also had to go to the backup car in June at Michigan after a practice mishap.\n\n\"You have to run so hard here that if the car slips it's around and gone,\" Johnson said. \"I ran a half a second faster today in practice than I did in qualifying yesterday. So, with the grill open and tires on low pressure and all that, especially these morning sessions with overcast clouds you just run so hard that when something happens, it's gone.\"\n\nQUALIFYING SWEEP\n\nFord vs. Chevrolet is always a matchup to watch in Michigan.

I don't know why. I was a screw-off when I was a teenager. I was late to work every day. I didn't put in the effort.

Because of changes in the cloud cover, and the fact his team had made last-second changes to the car, Keselowski was skeptical when he pulled onto the track for his final lap. But the changes made his car faster, and his time of 35.451 (203.097 mph) stood up as the best of the final 12. It is the 14th Coors Light pole of his career, his second of 2017 and his first in 17 tries at Michigan.\n\n\"A driver's home track, where his family and friends are all present, it just feels like a bigger event.

He is 18th in points and an insurmountable 95 points out of the 16th and final playoff spot.

Video by Ryan Ford/DFP Wochit\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nBROOKLYN, Mich. -- There's low-quality, grainy footage of Dale Earnhardt Jr. racing side by side with his father in the 1999 International Race of Champions series at Michigan International Speedway on YouTube.\n\nIn a dramatic finish, Earnhardt made two last-second attempts to pass his father, Dale Sr., on the last lap. He tried to pass him low, then he steered his Pontiac high on the final stretch. Neither maneuver worked.\n\nTo ensure father would beat son, Rusty Wallace nudged Dale Sr.'s car forward near the finish line, an unexpected move from a longtime rival.\n\nEarnhardt, who announced earlier this year he'll retire as a driver after this season, still can't believe he didn't beat his dad that day. He'll make what's expected to be his final run at MIS in the Pure Michigan 400 on Sunday. He told reporters Friday he often watches that YouTube clip and loses himself in the nostalgia of racing his dad, the seven-time Cup Series champion who died on the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500, and the success he's enjoyed in Michigan.\n\n\"Oh man, I've watched that a lot,\" he said. \"There is a YouTube clip of about the last five laps. I watch it and just think, 'Man, how in the hell did I lose that?' There was a lot that happened that day with me and dad running nose-to-nose, first and second, that whole race.\"\n\nMore NASCAR:\n\nThree things to watch in Sunday's NASCAR Pure Michigan 400\n\nChevy Camaro returning to NASCAR Cup Series in 2018: 'It's a monster'\n\nEarnhardt, 42, has 15 top-10 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series finishes at MIS, including wins in 2008 and 2012, when he finally broke through to end his four-year, 143-race winless streak. In the Xfinity Series, he had wins in 1999 and 2006, four finishes in the top five and never placed worse than seventh. He also had a pair of top-eight finishes racing IROC here.\n\nBut now, in the twilight of his racing career, he needs to replicate that success in what might be his best chance to secure a win and make a last-ditched push heading into the playoffs.\n\n\"We've still got a few races and hopefully something can get going,\" said Earnhardt, 23rd in Cup Series driver standings entering Sunday. \"We've got to find some speed.\"\n\nA finish similar to 1999 would help matters. The narrow defeat is his favorite memory at MIS.\n\n\"It was a very short race,\" he said. \"I don't remember how many laps or miles, but I got out of that car, and I've never been more tired in my life. I went to Victory Lane and just about passed out. I went to the infield care center and got two bags of IV fluids.\n\n\"I've never felt worse after a race for whatever reason. I must have held my breath the whole time. I don't know. But whatever it was, after I came down from the adrenaline that was pumping, I went to Victory Lane hoping that Tony (Eury) Sr. and all the guys are in the Xfinity garage and all excited, saying I about had him, and I did awesome. And I wanted my dad to say that.\"\n\nNope. Dale Sr. didn't acknowledge his son's competitive finish. He was too busy hoisting his trophy to the ceiling. Earnhardt longed for that feeling - and to make a name for himself.\n\nAs a teenager, Earnhardt set low expectations for himself after watching other drivers fail in their fathers' enormous NASCAR shadows. Dale Sr. had 428 top-10 Cup Series finishes and seven championships. Those marks looked impossible for Dale Jr. to match.\n\n\"I didn't put in much effort,\" Earnhardt said. \"I just didn't have my head on straight, so I shouldn't have amounted to much. ... I finally figured it out late, late in my career what I was supposed to be doing this whole time, as far as my job and being an asset and being accountable and applying myself. It took awhile, but some of us are late bloomers.\"\n\nEarnhardt relived the memory of his father and Wallace teaming up to beat him in 1999 on Friday. While he wanted a win, those memories still bring a smile to his face, especially remembering the actions of his father when they started the final five laps.\n\n\"He was motioning to me the whole time to stay right with him, to stay in line and not try to pass him,\" Earnhardt said. \"You could pull out and get alongside the guy in front of you pretty easily, but it was hard to pass on the bottom.\n\n\"He was like, 'Don't pull out, don't pull out.' I've got all these guys dogging me trying to pass and trying to pass. So, on the last lap, I got a run, went down into Turn 1 and got under him, and it didn't work, and I thought I was screwed.\"\n\nAnother car got behind Earnhardt and challenged him down the straightaway before they got to Turn 3. That forced Dale Sr. to take the turn from the bottom. Earnhardt thought he'd sneak into first by going high.\n\n\"I just went around a little bit higher, and it stuck, and I got along his outside coming out of turn four, and I was going by and he hit me,\" Earnhardt said. \"He was trying to side draft me, but he also hit me and that momentum I had going forward just stopped.\n\n\"His side draft started to work, and he started creeping forward, and Rusty was behind us. Rusty went behind dad for a second, which pushed dad a little farther. And then right at the last second, Rusty went low, low. That was all he needed to get back by me.\"\n\n\"I have always been ticked with Rusty for that whole thing,\" he added. \"He and dad were always one-upping each other. One would buy a plane, the other had to have the same plane. This one buys a farm, the other guy had to buy a farm. They did that their whole career. ... He had his one shot to really rub it in dad's face and push me to Victory Lane. He could have hung that over dad's head for so long.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "timeCrawl": "21:49:00", "sim": 0.800000011920929, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8847549", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "id": 392, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "id": 393, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "id": 594, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "id": 694, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

(AP) -- Dale Earnhardt Jr. was racing for the win in a 1999 IROC event at Michigan.\n\nProblem was, his opponent was in no mood to let him pass.\n\n\"Dad drove to the bottom so I just went around a little bit higher and it stuck, and I got along his outside,\" the younger Earnhardt recalled. \"I was going by and he hit me.\"\n\nDale Earnhardt won that race over Earnhardt Jr. by 0.007 seconds on one of many memorable days at Michigan International Speedway for Earnhardt Jr., whose farewell tour is passing through the track this weekend. Earnhardt Jr. would go on to win Cup races at MIS in 2008 and 2012, and he'll try to add another victory Sunday in his final race at the venue before he retires at the end of this season.\n\nThose wins in '08 and '12 were Earnhardt Jr.'s only Cup victories from 2007-13. The latter snapped a 143-race losing streak. But his memories at Michigan extend further back than that.\n\nThe exciting IROC finish in '99 included some contact between Earnhardt Jr.'s car and his father's -- a fun story line if there ever was one. Later that year, Junior pulled away from Jeff Gordon -- who was at that point the two-time defending Cup champion -- for a win in a Busch Series race at Michigan.\n\n\"It seemed like only me and him were racing each other for the win. I was very proud of that because I thought he was the best in the sport at the time,\" Earnhardt Jr. said. \"It was like beating Jimmie Johnson if he came down to the Xfinity Series. So, that was a big deal for us.\"\n\nBy 2012, Earnhardt Jr. was no longer an up-and-comer in his mid-20s. His victory at the 2-mile Michigan track that year ended his long drought. He'd go on to win four more Cup races in 2014 and three in 2015.\n\nEarnhardt Jr. is winless over the past two seasons, and he has only four top-10 finishes this year. Over the past week, he has been involved in a bit of a back-and-forth with Kevin Harvick, who suggested Junior's inability to achieve more success has hindered the sport's growth.\n\nBut Earnhardt Jr. has been plenty competitive in Michigan over the years. In fact, only two active drivers -- Kurt Busch and Matt Kenseth -- have more Cup wins at MIS.\n\n\"We've got some really good memories here. It's been a fun track,\" Earnhardt Jr. said. \"There has been some conversation about the 1.5-mile tracks with the words 'cookie cutter' and all that. That's been a conversation for a couple of decades now. But this place here is, to me, the standard for the 1.5-mile or 2-mile race track. This place is so much fun to race on for a driver. It's a great race track.\"\n\nMore things to watch in Sunday's race:\n\nGOING FOR THREE\n\nKyle Larson is trying for a third straight Cup win at Michigan after victories this June and last August. He'll be in the spotlight Sunday after team owner Chip Ganassi gave him permission to go to Iowa on Saturday to race in the Knoxville Nationals.\n\nHENDRICK PROBLEMS\n\nHendrick Motorsports teammates Johnson and Kasey Kahne both are on to backup cars after going into the wall during practice Saturday. Johnson also had to go to the backup car in June at Michigan after a practice mishap.\n\n\"You have to run so hard here that if the car slips it's around and gone,\" Johnson said. \"I ran a half a second faster today in practice than I did in qualifying yesterday. So, with the grill open and tires on low pressure and all that, especially these morning sessions with overcast clouds you just run so hard that when something happens, it's gone.\"\n\nQUALIFYING SWEEP\n\nFord vs. Chevrolet is always a matchup to watch in Michigan. Larson won for Chevy in June, but Ford swept the top three spots in qualifying Friday, with Team Penske's Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano going 1-2. Harvick was third.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: www.racing.ap.org .\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Video by Ryan Ford/DFP Wochit\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nBROOKLYN, Mich. -- There's low-quality, grainy footage of Dale Earnhardt Jr. racing side by side with his father in the 1999 International Race of Champions series at Michigan International Speedway on YouTube.\n\nIn a dramatic finish, Earnhardt made two last-second attempts to pass his father, Dale Sr., on the last lap. He tried to pass him low, then he steered his Pontiac high on the final stretch. Neither maneuver worked.\n\nTo ensure father would beat son, Rusty Wallace nudged Dale Sr.'s car forward near the finish line, an unexpected move from a longtime rival.\n\nEarnhardt, who announced earlier this year he'll retire as a driver after this season, still can't believe he didn't beat his dad that day. He'll make what's expected to be his final run at MIS in the Pure Michigan 400 on Sunday. He told reporters Friday he often watches that YouTube clip and loses himself in the nostalgia of racing his dad, the seven-time Cup Series champion who died on the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500, and the success he's enjoyed in Michigan.\n\n\"Oh man, I've watched that a lot,\" he said. \"There is a YouTube clip of about the last five laps. I watch it and just think, 'Man, how in the hell did I lose that?' There was a lot that happened that day with me and dad running nose-to-nose, first and second, that whole race.\"\n\nMore NASCAR:\n\nThree things to watch in Sunday's NASCAR Pure Michigan 400\n\nChevy Camaro returning to NASCAR Cup Series in 2018: 'It's a monster'\n\nEarnhardt, 42, has 15 top-10 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series finishes at MIS, including wins in 2008 and 2012, when he finally broke through to end his four-year, 143-race winless streak. In the Xfinity Series, he had wins in 1999 and 2006, four finishes in the top five and never placed worse than seventh. He also had a pair of top-eight finishes racing IROC here.\n\nBut now, in the twilight of his racing career, he needs to replicate that success in what might be his best chance to secure a win and make a last-ditched effort heading into the playoffs.\n\n\"This place is great,\" he said. \"This place is so much fun to race on for a driver. It's a great race track.\"\n\nYet that narrow defeat is his favorite memory at MIS.\n\n\"It was a very short race,\" he said. \"I don't remember how many laps or miles, but I got out of that car, and I've never been more tired in my life. I went to Victory Lane and just about passed out. I went to the infield care center and got two bags of IV fluids.\n\n\"I've never felt worse after a race for whatever reason. I must have held my breath the whole time. I don't know. But whatever it was, after I came down from the adrenaline that was pumping, I went to Victory Lane hoping that Tony (Eury) Sr. and all the guys are in the Xfinity garage and all excited, saying I about had him, and I did awesome. And I wanted my dad to say that.\"\n\nNope. Dale Sr. didn't acknowledge his son's competitive finish. He was too busy hoisting his trophy to the ceiling. Earnhardt longed for that feeling - and to make a name for himself.\n\nAs a teenager, Earnhardt set low expectations for himself after watching other drivers fail in their fathers' enormous NASCAR shadows. Dale Sr. had 428 top-10 Cup Series finishes and seven championships. Those marks looked impossible for Dale Jr. to match.\n\n\"I didn't put in much effort,\" Earnhardt said. \"I just didn't have my head on straight, so I shouldn't have amounted to much. ... I finally figured it out late, late in my career what I was supposed to be doing this whole time, as far as my job and being an asset and being accountable and applying myself. It took awhile, but some of us are late bloomers.\"\n\nEarnhardt relived the memory of his father and Wallace teaming up to beat him in 1999 on Friday. While he wanted a win, those memories still bring a smile to his face, especially remembering the actions of his father when they started the final five laps.\n\n\"He was motioning to me the whole time to stay right with him, to stay in line and not try to pass him,\" Earnhardt said. \"You could pull out and get alongside the guy in front of you pretty easily, but it was hard to pass on the bottom.\n\n\"He was like, 'Don't pull out, don't pull out.' I've got all these guys dogging me trying to pass and trying to pass. So, on the last lap, I got a run, went down into Turn 1 and got under him, and it didn't work, and I thought I was screwed.\"\n\nAnother car got behind Earnhardt and challenged him down the straightaway before they got to Turn 3. That forced Dale Sr. to take the turn from the bottom. Earnhardt thought he'd sneak into first by going high.\n\n\"I just went around a little bit higher, and it stuck, and I got along his outside coming out of turn four, and I was going by and he hit me,\" Earnhardt said. \"He was trying to side draft me, but he also hit me and that momentum I had going forward just stopped.\n\n\"His side draft started to work, and he started creeping forward, and Rusty was behind us. Rusty went behind dad for a second, which pushed dad a little farther. And then right at the last second, Rusty went low, low. That was all he needed to get back by me.\"\n\n\"I have always been ticked with Rusty for that whole thing,\" he added. \"He and dad were always one-upping each other. One would buy a plane, the other had to have the same plane. This one buys a farm, the other guy had to buy a farm. They did that their whole career. ...

About this time every year NASCAR takes all the cars and checks to make sure the competitive balance is where they want it to be,\" Keselowski said.\n\n\"You know, I think we've seen in the last two or three weeks that the Toyota cars are pretty dominant. So, we had a strong suspicion that those guys would kind of tune it down this weekend, so as not to post a pretty big number in inspection that didn't balance back out the competition.\n\n\"And, potentially that's right because our team hasn't done much differently, and those guys are just not as fast as they've been the last few weeks.\"\n\nThe proof of the pudding will be in the eating.\n\n\"We'll know for certain at the end of the week, based on whether NASCAR takes the cars after the race that day,\" Keselowski said.\n\n\"This is their last opportunity on a track that has the potential to showcase the important thing for the (playoffs), which is aerodynamics and horsepower. Because the (playoffs are) predominantly tracks of a mile and a half or of a similar high-speed nature to this.\n\n\"So, this is kind of the last opportunity for NASCAR to do that.\"\n\nKeselowski and the Penske Team anticipated the situation, he said.\n\n\"We came into the weekend thinking that some of those really strong cars would tune it down, and knowing that we'd probably be pretty close to what we had for the past few weeks,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not sure that's what happened, but it kind of looks that way, at the moment.\n\n\"But we'll still take what we can get.\"\n\nLogano seeks win\n\nGiven the points standings, Keselowski's Penske teammate Joey Logano almost certainly has to win one of the next four races, Michigan, Bristol, Darlington or Richmond, before the playoffs begin Sept. 17 in Chicago.\n\n\"We were able to make some good improvements on our race car and get to where we almost got the pole,\" Logano said. \"We missed it by seven-thousandths. So close!\"\n\nKeselowski and Logano have looked for more pace in their Fords for the stretch of races on the big tracks.\n\n\"Starting towards the front is a big deal here,\" Logano said, of MIS, where a repaving a half-dozen years ago has yet to yield an adequate race groove, to provide the side-by-side, multi-car action for which MIS had been noted for years.\n\n\"But anything can happen, the way the strategy is here, with the stages and the tires not falling off much.\n\n\"So, having speed in your car is always a big help, and it seems like we have that in our Shell/Pennzoil Ford this week.\"\n\nAfter a tough season, in which bad fortune arguably has thwarted his efforts more than the lack of pace, Logano said he would be thrilled to get a win.\n\n\"You have no idea,\" he said. \"Believe me, as you get closer to this thing, it becomes more and more real. But it is what it is. That's sports.\n\n\"As an athlete you have to learn how to handle pressure and that's not just the drivers in this situation, it's the whole team. Everybody has to do better in these occasions because the pressure is on.\n\n\"Let's be honest. The pressure is on, but a lot of items it's going to bring the best out of you, or sometimes the worst. You've got to make sure it's the best.\"\n\nCindric takes fifth in trucks race\n\nKeselowski is carrying on the family tradition of owning racing teams, and his NASCAR truck series driver, Austin Cindric, is hot.\n\nCindric, 18, drove like a 38-year-old after the start of the third stage of the LTi Printing 200 truck race Saturday, to hold the lead despite having a slower truck than his pursuers.\n\nLap after lap, Cindric -- son of Tim Cindric, the president of Team Penske and the crew chief for Will Power in the IndyCar Series -- held stubbornly to the lead before finishing fifth.\n\nIt is Cindric's fifth consecutive top-10 finish in the truck series, put him in 10th spot in the series and in a more comfortable playoff position.\n\nChase Briscoe, another driver for Brad Keselowski Racing (BKR) finished ninth.\n\nBriscoe is fourth in the series, heading towards the playoffs.\n\ngregg.krupa@detroitnews.com\n\ntwitter.com/greggkrupa\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "timeCrawl": "22:11:00", "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2800, "date": "2017-09-17", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2808}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8849123", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "id": 392, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "id": 393, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "id": 694, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "id": 1249, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

They sent him a photo of him later, for further proof.\n\n\"You know what's so cool?\" one fan jokingly asked Keselowski. \"That the winner of tomorrow's race is here right now.

It's a great race track.\"\n\nSome of Junior's fondest memories from his racing career came at Michigan. And they're not all wins. He won here twice in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series and twice in the NASCAR Xfinity Series. But one of his strongest memories comes from a race he lost -- the 1999 IROC race, the end of which he has rewatched numerous times. Alas, the outcome has not changed.\n\nComing out of Turn 4 toward the checkered flag, he and his father, Dale Earnhardt Sr., were battling for the win. Rusty Wallace came up behind them. Wallace could have pushed Junior to the win -- which would have been poetically perfect, Junior said.\n\nWallace and Earnhardt Sr. flipped between friends and rivals throughout their careers. That was true on and off the track. If one of them bought a plane, the other one bought a bigger plane. So Junior thought that if Wallace pushed the son past the father for the win, Wallace would have been able to hold that over Earnhardt Sr.'s head forever. But Wallace didn't get behind either one of them, and the elder Earnhardt won the race.\n\nJunior said, half-jokingly, that he's still mad at Wallace, 19 years later, for not helping him.\n\nKAHNE ON THE SEARCH FOR A RIDE NEXT SEASON\n\nKasey Kahne's job hunt started soon after it was announced that he would not return in 2018 to the No. 5 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet.\n\nKahne has won six races in his nearly six years at Hendrick Motorsports and 18 in his career. He is widely considered to have underperformed in his time at Hendrick. He hopes he will be able to land a ride in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series and that the new job will rejuvenate his career.\n\n\"I think that it's all about people,\" Kahne said. \"If you can get the people behind you and believe in you and then I believe in them, and we work together for the same goal to win races. It's a competitive series it is a super tough series to win in and so many things have to go right for the entire race weekend and then throughout the race.\"\n\nTeam owner Rick Hendrick shouldered the blame for the No. 5 team's subpar performance and says he will help Kahne get a new ride.\n\n\"To have him behind you is a really good thing,\" Kahne said. \"I respect him a ton. Yeah, I hope we can build something out of that, but I also have been working in my own direction as well on certain things to make sure I just check out everything that is out there for sure.\"\n\nDIBENEDETTO WILL RETURN TO GO FAS RACING IN 2018\n\nMatt DiBenedetto will return to the No. 32 Go Fas Racing Ford, he and team general manager Mason St. Hilaire announced on Saturday at Michigan International Speedway. Amid a flurry of silly season moves, this is the rare one that affords a driver and his team to build on consistency.\n\n\"Our business model in the beginning was be able to survive,\" St. Hilaire said. \"We had a revolving door of drivers for a long time, and it kept the doors open, and it kept people working, and I wouldn't take it back for anything.\"\n\nStill, working with DiBenedetto and crew chief Gene Nead has given the team stability, and with that stability has come improvement. The team's average finish this year (26.1) is more than six spots better than the team's historical average.\n\nThe team has its first two top 10s this season--in the season opening Daytona 500 and the Brickyard 400. \"We had some little growing pans and had a couple little issues happen a few (races) in a row, but we've had that speed there all year and the more we go along, the more that we're prepared and keep bringing better racecars to the racetrack,\" DiBenedetto said.\n\nHENDRICK TEAMMATES WILL GO TO BACKUP CARS\n\nHendrick Motorsports teammates Jimmie Johnson and Kahne will start the Pure Michigan 400 in backup cars after both were involved in separate incidents during the two practices on Saturday at Michigan International Speedway.", "timeCrawl": "19:58:00", "sim": 0.6313725709915161, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 587, "date": "2017-08-13", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 594}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8837596", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "id": 392, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "id": 393, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "id": 1249, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

He set the mark of 35.451-seconds (202.097mph). Keselowski, Logano, Harvick topped Kenseth with three minutes remaining in the session.\n\nErik Jones lap was sixth-quick initially, but he was a bumped by Kyle Busch and then Chase Elliott. Ryan Blaney, who led the first two rounds, could only muster the 12th-fastest lap -- 201.235mph when he took to the track with two minutes to go.

Twenty-three drivers completed laps with five minutes to go.\n\nTrevor Bayne was the last driver to make an attempt with just over two minutes on the clock. Austin Dillon returned to the track for a second attempt. With one minute remaining, Keselowski, Earnhardt and Busch took another shot. Keselowski jumped from 13th to second on the speed chart with a lap of 203.069mph.

He topped the chart with a lap of 201.292mph. Just before the five-minute mark, Jones (200.239mph) vaulted to third followed by Johnson (199.137mph). Moments later, Truex ran the fourth fastest lap but with 14 minutes to go, Ryan Blaney jumped to the top of the leader board with his lap of 201.686mph. Thirteen minutes in Bowyer bumped up to ninth. Hamlin's first lap of 199.839mph was fast enough for sixth -- until Larson cruised up to third-quick with a lap of 201.072mph.\n\nJust under 11 minutes, Logano claimed the sixth fastest speed of 200.228mph. His Penske teammate Brad Keselowski posted the 12th-quick lap of 198.890mph. He was knocked to 13th after Kyle Busch ran a lap of 199.784mph in his newly repaired No. 18 Toyota.\n\nThirty-six cars posted times with nine minutes remaining on the clock. Ty Dillon ran three laps but couldn't improve on his 31st-place spot. Almirola, who was 25th, made his second attempt with 7.5-seconds to go. He matched Ryan Newman, who was on the bubble, then moved up to 21st -- on his third lap with over six minutes to go.\n\nPaul Menard was one of the last cars on the track but couldn't break into the top 24. Newman and Landon Cassill made second attempts. Newman climbed up to 22nd and bumped Michael McDowell. Ricky Stenhouse Jr. shot up to seventh (200.161mph) on his first attempt and knocked Matt DiBenedetto out of the final transfer spot. Kahne's second attempt carried the No. 5 Chevy to 11th quick -- 199.275mph.", "timeCrawl": "01:23:00", "sim": 0.5529412031173706, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8729034", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "id": 69, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "id": 392, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "id": 393, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "id": 761, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

"body": "The 2017 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series has settled back into a familiar routine ahead of Sunday's Pure Michigan 400 at Michigan International Speedway.\n\nOver the last two weeks, shocking early-season performances due to the new stage-based format fell into the background as usual suspects like Martin Truex Jr. and Kyle Busch traded checkered flags at marquee summer events.\n\nSunday's affair at MIS is another of those major showdowns weeks ahead of the postseason, where this year's five multi-race winners will jockey for positioning and those on the outside looking in will put on aggressive performances while hunting for the required win.\n\nBelow, let's take a look at the information surrounding the showdown and outline some of the biggest drivers to watch, spanning the leaders and one notable driver still seeking to throw his name into the playoff race.\n\nIt seemed a matter of time before Truex inserted himself back into Victory Lane and bumped his playoff positioning.\n\nTruex, almost quietly, has been this year's hottest driver while suiting up for Furniture Row Racing. Four wins or not, almost every week of the season seemingly featuring a new winner has made it easy to overlook his run of dominance.\n\nLast week at Watkins Glen wasn't any exception, with Truex and crew chief Cole Pearn executing a fuel-management performance that will easily fall into the \"season's best\" category by the time everything is finalized.\n\n\"As slow as I felt like I was going, I felt like I could have run 10 more laps,\" Truex said, according to Geoffrey Miller of the Ledger Dispatch. \"I literally was like, 'You've got to be kidding me, I need to go even slower?' It's excruciating to go that slow here and to try to save that much fuel.\"\n\nSavvy maneuvering on Truex's part isn't a surprise after his other three wins this year. He didn't lead a huge amount of laps in a win at Las Vegas (150-of-267), nor at Kansas City (104-of-267) or Kentucky (152-of-274).\n\nFans can expect Truex to once again be one of the top drivers to watch because he won't stop practicing this efficiency now while trying to make Busch's climb all the more difficult.\n\nKyle Larson is one of a handful of drivers putting on a dominant performance this year, though it isn't necessarily capturing all the headlines thanks to the general chaos of the developments thus far.\n\nStill, Larson has two wins to his name entering Michigan this weekend, where he's a top candidate to put himself in a great position heading into the playoff. After all, he's the defending winner at this event.\n\nLarson only lead 41 laps a year ago at this event, yet he came away with the checkered flag in a much-needed triumph. He's not as desperate as this season, though he does seem ready to cash in on a turnaround ahead of the postseason:\n\nOne of the reasons Larson has dropped out of the usual conversation is because of three consecutive finishes of 23rd or worse during a forgettable July that bled into the first week of August, with the latest coming at Watkins Glen as he started second and finished 23rd.\n\nAs Larson himself noted, though, he's back to his usual preferred tracks. And what better place to turn things around than at MIS, where he won a year ago?\n\nIt was easy to think Busch finally getting his first win of the season signaled a return to normalcy that would see Dale Earnhardt Jr. also grab his first checkered flag.\n\nInstead, Earnhardt dropped out at 37th place a week ago, stifling what looked like solid momentum gained after a 12th-place slotting at Pocono the week prior.\n\nNow? Earnhardt has had to deflect widely circulated comments by fellow driver Kevin Harvick, who suggested No. 88 has hurt the growth of the sport over the years.\n\n\"I certainly hope that's not the case,\" Earnhardt said, according to ESPN.com's Bob Pockrass. \"I put a lot into this sport, and I know that I might not have met everyone's expectations, but I certainly exceeded my own and I'm super proud of what I've been able to accomplish.\"\n\nSaid expectations continue to chase Earnhardt this season as he mostly waves goodbye. One of his lone top-10 performances this year came at MIS, so there's an air of slight optimism around his performance this weekend with the season winding down.\n\nIf Earnhardt can tune out the noise and rediscover his form at one of the summer's biggest events, it'll make for one of this thrilling season's top moments.", "timeCrawl": "21:49:00", "sim": 0.5372549295425415, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8847548", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "id": 392, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "id": 393, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "id": 694, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

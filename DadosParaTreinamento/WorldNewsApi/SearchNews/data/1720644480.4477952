{"id": 231204030, "title": "Wildest soap cameos from Boris Johnson to Ed Sheeran", "text": "A good or bad day for casting directors? The jury is out! Picture: Metro.co.uk/Getty) Neighbours is set to welcome an unexpected new resident later this year, when none other than Selling Sunset star Chrishell Stause rocks up on Ramsay Street. The much-loved reality TV realtor \u2013 who is actually a seasoned soap star, having cut her teeth on US soaps All My Children and Days of Our Lives before starring in the Netflix property series \u2013 is set to join the Neighbours cast as mysterious businesswoman Yasmine Shields. It\u2019s fair to say her casting announcement came as somewhat of a surprise to both Neighbours and Selling Sunset fans alike. However, it\u2019s certainly not the first time a familiar face has randomly popped up in Soapland, as this lot prove\u2026 Ed Sheeran in Home & Away If you don\u2019t keep up with the action in Summer Bay, chances are this might have passed you by, but we can assure you Ed Sheeran really did make a cameo in Home & Away back in 2015. The Thinking Out Loud singer dropped by The Diner to be reunited with his former nanny, Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons), who \u2013 in universe \u2013 looked after \u2018Teddy\u2019 when he was a kid and she lived in England. However, Marilyn hadn\u2019t quite realised how big of a star he\u2019d become in the intervening years. Ed said of his appearance at the time: \u2018I got asked to do it and it sounded like it could be fun\u2026 I\u2019m sure if Emmerdale or EastEnders ever ask me, I would do that as well.\u2019 Eight years later, however, he\u2019s still to set foot in Walford or The Woolpack\u2026 Boris Johnson in EastEnders Long before Boris Johnson took up residence in No 10 (simpler times, eh?), he swung by The Queen Vic for a pint in 2009, much to the excitement of a peacocking Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). The iconic landlady had vowed to give the then-London Mayor a piece of her mind after he if she ever clapped eyes on him. But just moments later, when a bicycle puncture coincidentally led him to take refuge in the east end boozer, she was fawning over him. At the time, Labour raised concerns about whether the BBC should have been portraying the Tory MP \u2018as pretty straight guy on such a popular show\u2019, but the broadcaster insisted his cameo was \u2018compatible both with BBC editorial guidelines and the principle of due impartiality\u2019. Lorraine Kelly in Coronation Street It might once have been claimed that Lorraine Kelly presents a persona of herself on her ITV show daytime show Lorraine, but her acting skills were a little less convincing when she made an appearance in Coronation Street. The 2019 scene saw Corrie regulars Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) and Gail Platt (Helen Worth) doing a spot of archery, but when they got distracted, Gail ended up shooting the telly legend in the leg. What they were all doing at an archery club in the first place, we\u2019re still not quite sure, but who are we to pick holes in this masterpiece of storytelling. Earlier this year, Lorraine admitted to Graham Norton that her performance was \u201cas wooden as a forest of trees\u201d. Torvill and Dean in Emmerdale Another spot of ITV cross promotion saw Dancing on Ice judges Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean quite literally slide into the Dales, after being enlisted to help Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper) propose to Tom King (James Chase) in 2022. Sinitta in Neighbours Sinitta was just one of a number of random stars, including Emma Bunton, Sir Michael Parkinson, Neil Morrissey and Jo Whiley, who featured in scenes when Neighbours filmed a set of special episodes in London back in 2007. Sadly for us, however, the So Macho singer\u2019s outfit was a lot more low-key than the ones she famously sported during her various appearances on The X Factor. Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man in EastEnders Easties superfan Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man ticked joining the soap off his bucket list in 2022. The storyline saw Rocky Cotton (Brian Conley) pulling in a favour from the Human hitmaker to perform a carol concert fundraiser in Albert Square as a wedding gift to Queen Vic landlord Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) and Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). Perhaps better than Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man\u2019s cameo, though, was the social media content featuring Jessie Wallace and Linda Henry (aka Walford\u2019s Kat Slater and Shirley Carter) we were treated to as a result. Take a look at the video below to see what we mean\u2026 @ragnboneman I\u2019m sorry that I made you cry Linda ? #eastenders #ragnboneman #skin #walford #christmas #fyp #foryou #festiveseason \u266c Skin \u2013 Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man Janet Street Porter in Neighbours As part of our 20 challenges before our 20th birthday in September, our Janet will be starring as herself in @neighbours on 19 April! #LooseWomen20 pic.twitter.com/CNg7TWJTZt\u2014 Loose Women (@loosewomen) January 30, 2019 As part of a series of challenges set to celebrate Loose Women\u2019s 20th anniversary in 2019, Janet Street Porter achieved one of her biggest life ambitions by starring in Neighbours. The former tabloid editor was seen at The Waterhole grabbing a drink, but while she was on set, she realised she had a connection Sheila Canning actress Colette Mann, having worked together on a daily Australian TV show Janet hosted back in the 80s. Recalling the moment on Loose Women, she said: \u2018When I went on the set she went, \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t seen you for a few years!\u201d \u2018I was thinking what\u2019s her name, what\u2019s her name, what\u2019s her name!\u2019 Awkward. AJ and Curtis Pritchard in Hollyoaks It\u2019s fair to say Hollyoaks fans had a lot of thoughts when former Strictly Come Dancing professional AJ and his Love Island brother Curtis joined the Hollyoaks cast as a pair of dancing brothers in 2021. While the pair didn\u2019t have to exactly stray too far from reality in their roles, their acting skills \u2013 or perhaps lack thereof \u2013 saw them immortalised in meme form forever more, thanks to this scene in particular\u2026 Agreeing with much of what was said on social media at the time, Curtis later admitted on Straight To The Comments! podcast: \u2018Our acting on that was GCSE grade quality.\u2019", "summary": "EastEnders, Coronation Street, Hollyoaks and Neighbours have had their share of unexpected famous faces popping up.", "url": "https://metro.co.uk/2024/06/08/wildest-soap-cameos-boris-johnson-ed-sheeran-20993817/", "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SEC_207598278-edff.jpg?quality=90&strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:00:00", "author": "Ash Percival", "authors": ["Ash Percival"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.144}

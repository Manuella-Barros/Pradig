The Okaloosa County Sheriff\u2019s Office has released the deputy\u2019s body camera video of the May 3 shooting and redacted 911 calls and reports, but not the deputy\u2019s name. The agency also has not said if the deputy has made any statement to investigators. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating, but since its probe is ongoing, it won\u2019t comment. Fortson was Black. The deputy\u2019s race has not been released. Fortson, 23, had no criminal record, and there is no evidence he was involved in the disturbance that led to the deputy being called to the apartment complex. Fortson was alone in his apartment, and his girlfriend has said she and Fortson were having a normal video conversation when the deputy began pounding on the door. Ben Crump, the family\u2019s attorney, has called the shooting \u201can unjustifiable killing,\u201d and Matt Gaetz, the area\u2019s staunchly Republican congressman, said Fortson did nothing wrong. Here are some of the key issues surrounding the case: ___ Why was the deputy at Fortson\u2019s apartment? Just before 4:25 p.m. on May 3, a female employee of the Elan Apartments in the Florida Panhandle community of Fort Walton Beach called the sheriff\u2019s office, saying a resident had reported a loud argument that had been going on for 20 minutes. It was said that it \u201csounded like it was getting physical\u201d and that \u201cit happens often.\u201d She gave Fortson\u2019s fourth-floor apartment as the location of the disturbance, but he was home alone. At the operator\u2019s suggestion, the employee walked near Fortson\u2019s unit and reported that she didn\u2019t hear anything. The deputy arrived about three minutes later, according to body camera video. He went into the office, where a man directed him to the parking lot. A woman met him there. On video she sounds like the employee who told the operator she would meet the deputy. Her face has been blurred out in the video. \u201cAre they fighting or something?\u201d the deputy asked. She responded that there was an apparent argument in one of the apartments and it \u201cis getting out of hand.\u201d He asked which apartment. \u201cI don\u2019t know. So I\u2019m not sure,\u201d she responded. She then told the deputy that two weeks earlier she heard someone yelling and cursing in the apartment, followed by a noise that sounded like a slap, but she hadn\u2019t reported it. The deputy again asked which apartment, and this time the woman gave Fortson\u2019s apartment number. The deputy repeated the number. She confirmed the apartment was on the fourth floor and gave the deputy directions. Fortson lived alone and had no visitors at the time of the shooting. That has raised questions over whether the deputy was directed to the wrong apartment. County 911 dispatch records show deputies had never been called to his apartment before. However deputies had been called to another fourth-floor apartment 10 times in the previous eight months, including once for a family disturbance. A 911 call made by a resident apparently just after the fatal shooting referenced arguing between a man and woman in an apartment where a child lives. Crump has said he believes police were sent to the wrong apartment. It\u2019s not clear if he is referencing the apartment where police had previously been called. ___ What happened when the deputy arrived at Fortson\u2019s door? The deputy arrived outside Fortson\u2019s door less than three minutes after he got to the complex. He listened silently for 20 seconds outside, but no voices inside are heard on his body camera. He then pounded on the door, but didn\u2019t identify himself. He then moved to the side of the door, about 5 feet away (1.5 meters). He waited 15 seconds before pounding on the door again. This time he yelled, \u201cSheriff\u2019s office \u2014 open the door!\u201d He again moved to the side. Less then 10 seconds later, he moved back in front of the door and pounded again, announcing himself once more. Fortson opened the door, his legally purchased gun in his right hand. It was at his side, pointing to the ground. The deputy said \u201cStep back\u201d then immediately began firing. Fortson fell backward onto the floor. Only then did the deputy yell, \u201cDrop the gun!\u201d Fortson replied, \u201cIt\u2019s over there.\u201d The deputy called for paramedics, but Fortson died a short time later at the hospital. What happened after the shooting? In the hours after the shooting, the sheriff\u2019s office issued a short press release that offered few details. It said the deputy had responded to a call about a disturbance and had heard it himself, which is not corroborated by the body camera audio. \u201cHe reacted in self defense after he encountered a 23-year old man armed with a gun and after the deputy had identified himself as law enforcement,\u201d the statement said. The shooting gained little media attention for several days. It wasn\u2019t until Fortson\u2019s family questioned how an airman with no record could be shot by a deputy in his doorway and hired Crump that it gained national notice. \u201cOne thing is clear from the body cam and should be stated unequivocally: Roger did not deserve to die. He did nothing wrong,\u201d Rep. Gaetz said in a statement. Hundreds attended Fortson\u2019s funeral near his family home in suburban Atlanta, with fellow airmen filing past his flag-draped coffin as they paid their respect. The apartment where Fortson lived is about 8 miles (13 kilometers) from Hurlburt Field, where Fortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator serving on an AC-130J Ghostrider gunship. One of his roles was to load the plane\u2019s 30mm and 105mm cannons during battles.", "summary": "The fatal shooting of Roger Fortson by a Florida sheriff\u2019s deputy when the Air Force senior airman opened his door armed with a handgun pointed down happened almost a month ago, but the information released so far hasn\u2019t clarified why the officer was directed to his apartment.", "url": "https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/05/29/what-to-know-about-airman-roger-fortsons-fatal-shooting-by-a-florida-sheriffs-deputy/", "image": "https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Police_Shooting_Airman_What_We_Know_53273.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:11:08", "author": "Tara Copp,Terry Spencer", "authors": ["Tara Copp", "Terry Spencer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.888}

Nick Chubb is expected to return in the 2024 season after contract adjustments and a major injury. The Browns are optimistic that Watson will return to peak performance in the upcoming season.\n\nCleveland Browns general manager Andrew Berry took some time to update the press on Deshaun Watson's recovery from his shoulder injury recently.\n\nWatson initially picked up the injury in Week 10 of the 2023 season, when he began complaining of discomfort in his right shoulder.\n\nUpon medical checkup, he was diagnosed with a displaced fracture to the glenoid of his right shoulder. The surgery that followed saw him ruled out for the remainder of the season. The 28-year-old was feared to take a longer time before returning to action. However, Berry has given a reassuring update on Watson's recovery, describing his return as \"ahead of schedule\" (via NFL.com):\n\nFirst and foremost, Deshaun has really worked his tail off during the rehabilitation process over the last several months. He's really actually ahead of schedule. He's really chomping at the bit to take the governor off so to speak, but really he's had a really nice spring. He's thrown the ball well.\n\nDid a really nice job during our 7-on-7 and team periods during this veteran minicamp. So, we're excited as he gets into training camp and gets the pads on. He's making excellent progress. Honestly, if you didn't know he got hurt last year, you really wouldn't be able to tell the difference. We're very excited once camp starts.\n\nThe Browns' general manager also gave updates on Nick Chubb, who was knocked out of the 2023 season following a devastating knee injury in Week 2.\n\nRelated Browns Will Set Another Dubious NFL Record If DeShaun Watson Struggles in 2024\n\nCleveland needs its franchise quarterback to earn his paycheck, lest they find themselves stuck in mediocrity and cap hell.\n\nWatson Must Pay Dividends in 2024 Browns paid a high price for a former Pro Bowler, but he has underperformed in Cleveland\n\nThe Browns, however, were quick to readjust the star RB's contract to keep him for the 2024 season:\n\nOne of the moments that we're all most looking forward to is the first time he runs out of that home tunnel for his debut of the 2024 season. So we're really excited to have him back and can't wait to get going with him.\n\nBerry, however, refused to give concrete insight into Amari Cooper's contract. He only described Cooper as 'a big part of the team'.\n\nSince the $230 million contract handed to Watson by the Browns in 2022, there has been much to be desired about his performance. In the 2020 season, Watson delivered 33 touchdowns for the Houston Texans, with a total of 4,823 passing yards, which led the NFL. However, he only managed about a fourth of that in each of his first two seasons for the Browns.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: Deshaun Watson never averaged fewer than 240 yards per game, less than a 5.1 TD rate, less than a 46 percent success rate, under 7.8 yards per attempt, or under 98.0 passer rating while with the Texans. He has gone below all of those marks in both seasons with the Browns.\n\nDespite the dip in form, his quality is not to be questioned. His coach, fans, and everyone at the Browns believe his five-year contract will eventually pay off -- but if it doesn't start paying dividends in 2024, the whole lot of them might have to rethink their investment in Deshaun Watson.\n\nSource: NFL.com\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise.\n\nRelated DeShaun Watson Has Injury Scare At Celebrity Softball Game\n\nThe Browns' QB escaped unscathed from a collision during David Njoku's softball game.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_XFL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2023 XFL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Berry_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Berry (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_XFL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 XFL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-Football-Reference.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro-Football-Reference.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Njoku", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Njoku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amari Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Fastpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Fastpitch", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/mixcollage-19-feb-2024-09-56-am-8454.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660084", "eventUri": "eng-9660084", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

The Browns' $230 million quarterback suffered a displaced fracture to the glenoid in his right shoulder in November. So far, Watson has been able to dispel any concern that the injury will hold him back next season.\n\n\"First and foremost, Deshaun has really worked his tail off during the rehabilitation process over the last several months,\" Browns GM Andrew Berry said during an appearance on The Insiders on Monday, June 18. \"He's really actually ahead of schedule. He's really chomping at the bit to take the governor off so to speak, but really he's had a really nice spring. He's thrown the ball well. Did a really nice job during our 7-on-7 and team periods during this veteran minicamp. So, we're excited as he gets into training camp and gets the pads on.\n\n\"He's making excellent progress. Honestly if you didn't know he got hurt last year, you really wouldn't be able to tell the difference. We're very excited once camp starts.\"\n\nThe Browns have invested a significant amount of their cap space and draft capital in Watson as their franchise quarterback. That hasn't worked out, mostly because he's not been on the field. Watson has played just 12 games since landing with the Browns in 2022 via a blockbuster trade.\n\n\"We'd all love to have him on the field more often,\" Berry said in January. \"I think that's safe to say, himself included. Do feel really good about him, happy with the progress that he's made within our organization, both on the field and off the field.\n\n\"And we're looking forward to getting him back next year. We think he's going to have a really big year and have a ton of confidence in him as our starting quarterback.\"\n\nThe Browns added some depth to their quarterback room this offseason, bracing for a worse-case situation where Watson misses more time. The most notable addition was former No. 1 overall pick Jameis Winston. He's taken on a veteran leadership role within the group of passers.\n\n\"Every day, he comes in, very respectful. He wants to lead and learn from everybody,\" Watson said on his \"QB Unplugged\" show on June 7. \"He wants to be able to serve and that's the key word for Jameis.

For quarterback Deshaun Watson though there's more work to do.\n\nWatson shared a series of videos to his Instagram story on Wednesday, showing the star QB going through some personalized passing drills at the Wasserman Football Center at UCLA. The 28-year-old signal caller said during his most recent media availability that he'd be continuing a designated throwing program during his time away from the facility. It's all part of a plan laid out by team doctors and Dr. Neal ElAttrache, who performed surgery on Watson's fractured shoulder nearly seven months ago.\n\nThroughout the spring, Watson has taken a conservative approach to his rehab, gradually increasing his workload throughout voluntary OTAs and mandatory minicamp. When camp broke last week, Watson's routine had him throwing every other day at practice, including during the team's seven-on-seven drills.\n\nHe has yet to participate in full team drills, but that is expected to come during training camp later this summer. During the team's final practice of minicamp Watson even pushed the ball down the field a few times, more so than he had at any other point in the spring.\n\nAs things stand, Watson is on track to be ready for the start of the season, something he'd been adamant about since arriving in Berea for the start of the offseason program back in April.

Based on Watson's spring performance, the team is encouraged. Despite coming off a season-ending 2023 shoulder injury, Cleveland.com's Mary Kay Cabot noted Watson's impressive showing during minicamp.\n\n\"One was a heat-seeking 50-yard strike on a bootleg left to Elijah Moore that went off of his hand,\" Cabot wrote. \"The bomb was his longest attempt in the four days he threw in front of the media, including two in organized team activities and two in minicamp.\"\n\nOf course, the pass was still incomplete so perhaps Watson isn't all the way back yet. But the framing of the article highlighted Watson's impressive arm strength. Another passage noted that he showed \"more zip on the ball than in any other practice, Watson demonstrated that he can make any throw on the route tree.\"\n\nThat reporting tracks with what head coach Kevin Stefanski said earlier in the month, noting that Watson looks like his prime-quarterback self. Later, he told reporters that Watson was ahead of schedule after undergoing right shoulder surgery to fix a fractured glenoid.\n\nCleveland will have to hope Watson carries that over into the fall. Trading the farm and handing him a monster fully guaranteed contract, 2024 is a critical season. He spent most of 2022 suspended and most of 2023 injured, leaving the Browns with little to show for their all-in move. He's started just 12 games for Cleveland, completed less than 60 percent of his throws, and has only 14 touchdowns to nine interceptions with far too many sacks.\n\nThe Browns added more weapons for Watson to throw to, acquiring Denver WR Jerry Jeudy in an early offseason trade. The offensive line will hopefully be healthier while the eventual return of RB Nick Chubb will stabilize a running game that missed him a year ago.\n\nAfter seeing Deshaun Watson early last year, the Steelers will wait to play the Browns this season. Pittsburgh is slated to see Cleveland in Week 12 and Week 14, the former a Thursday night contest. The latter contest will be part of NFL Films \"Hard Knocks\" coverage as they follow all four AFC North teams down the stretch of the season. All six of Pittsburgh's divisional games take place over the final eight weeks, including four during that six-week TV span.\n\nWatson has yet to beat the Steelers in his career, going 0-3 versus them. Predictably, his output has been poor, Watson throwing five touchdowns with four interceptions and getting sacked 18 times.\n\nRelated Items:Cleveland Browns, Deshaun Watson, Mark Kay Cabot Recommended for you Report: Amari Cooper, Browns At Contract Impasse, Cleveland Unwilling To Extend Beyond One Year Deshaun Watson: 'I Must Be Pretty Damn Good' If People Are Debating About Me Depot After Dark: Heyward Golf Outing, Lee Family Expecting, Browns Player Has No Chill", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_kozora@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Alex Kozora", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stefanski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stefanski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Knocks_(2001_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hard Knocks (2001 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jeudy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jeudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Films", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL Films"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amari Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Throws", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Throws", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Performance_and_Capacity/Capacity_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Performance and Capacity/Capacity Planning", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives/Activities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives/Activities", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Deshaun-Watson-pass-throw.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660084", "eventUri": "eng-9660084", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

A healthy Deshaun Watson is expected to lead a dynamic offense for the Browns. Elijah Moore adds explosive playmaking ability to the Browns' receiving corps.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns traded for Deshaun Watson in March 2022 and immediately gave him a massive contract extension.\n\nThings haven't worked out that well since then, as the quarterback has only started 12 games over two years thanks to suspension and injuries. Watson is expected to be healthy this year, though, and the receivers he's throwing to are excited.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Daniel Oyefusi, Elijah Moore, the team's WR2 in 2023 and a New York Jets second-round pick from 2021, recently remarked:\n\nI just feel like it's going to be a lot more explosive.\n\nWatson started six of the team's first nine games of the 2023 season, leading the Browns to a 5-1 record in those outings. However, he broke a bone in his shoulder during a Week 9 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, forcing him to miss the rest of the season.\n\nDespite this injury, the Browns still made the playoffs, thanks to strong play from Comeback Player of the Year Joe Flacco that had some whacky Browns fans calling for a Flacco coup under center.\n\nRelated\n\nBrowns' Pro Bowler Becomes Latest Star WR To Holdout During Mandatory Minicamps\n\nAmari Cooper is about to play the last season of a five-year deal he signed in 2020 and the star wideout is looking for an extension.\n\nBrowns Have a Dynamic Group of Wide Receivers\n\nA healthy Browns offense will be hard to stop\n\nThe Browns' best receiver is Amari Cooper, a true number one. The team acquired him in 2022, and he has rewarded them with two 1,000-yard seasons, 14 touchdown receptions, and a 2023 Pro Bowl nod. Cooper is currently seeking a new contract from the team, however, and is holding out of mandatory minicamp.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat : While he is entering his 10th season, Amari Cooper has shown no signs of slowing down. He averaged 17.4 yards per catch last season, the best mark of his career.\n\nCleveland made another move to improve their receiver room in 2024 by trading for former Denver Broncos wideout Jerry Jeudy.\n\nDue in part to trade rumors right up until the deadline, the 25-year-old had a bit of a down season by his standards in 2023, but should bounce back nicely catching passes from Watson. He's shown he can do it, as in 2022, he set career highs with 67 receptions for 976 yards and six touchdown catches despite QB Russell Wilson having a career-worst year.\n\nElijah Moore was a 2023 trade addition, and he plays out of the slot for the Browns. A talented player who has dealt with injuries, he played in all 17 games last year, catching a career-high 59 balls for 640 yards.

The Browns are hoping they won't have to go to those lengths in 2024.\n\nOn paper, Cleveland looks like a terrific ballclub. It has big-time pieces on both sides of the ball, especially defensively, where it ranked No. 1 in the league last year. But the game isn't played on paper, and the Browns unfortunately reside in the NFL's toughest division in the AFC North.\n\nBut what does Cleveland have to do to make it back to the playoffs and potentially make a deeper run? Better yet, what can stop the Browns from doing that?\n\nHere are three huge questions Cleveland must answer heading into 2024.\n\nSince landing in Cleveland through a blockbuster trade with the Houston Texans in March 2022, Deshaun Watson has played in just 12 games. He served an 11-game suspension in his debut campaign, and this past year, a shoulder injury knocked him out after six contests. He underwent surgery to repair the issue and should be ready for Week 1.\n\nEven when Watson has been on the field for the Browns over his first couple of years with the club, he hasn't looked promising. Realistically, it has been four years since Watson had a great season.\n\nWill he be able to rebound in 2024?\n\nHe must if Cleveland wants to have any chance of contending for a Super Bowl. The Joe Flacco story was nice last season, but we saw what happened in the playoffs. The Browns did sign Jameis Winston in free agency, and while he is a very capable backup, they probably don't want him starting.\n\nDoes Watson need to be his 2020 self where he led the NFL in passing yards? No, but he does need to be a heck of a lot better than he was in 2022 and 2023, where he amassed 14 passing touchdowns and 11 interceptions. That isn't going to get it done.\n\nNick Chubb suffered a devastating knee injury in Week 2 of last season, tearing his ACL and MCL. Not only is his 2024 season in flux, but his career may be in jeopardy.\n\nChubb is on the mend, but there is no timetable for his return. He could come back in November. He could come back for the last couple of weeks of the campaign. Or, he may not take the field in 2024 at all.\n\nWhen healthy, Chubb is one of the NFL's best running backs. After all, he racked up 1,525 yards and 12 touchdowns on the ground in 2022. But thanks to the horrific knee injury, he may never be that type of rusher again. The Browns need to be prepared for that.\n\nJerome Ford will likely be the lead back, and free-agent signing D'Onta Foreman will serve as his backup. It isn't exactly Chubb, but the Browns don't have much of a choice here.\n\nWe'll see if Chubb can return at some point this coming season, but it isn't looking very likely that he will be able to have much of a role even if he does.\n\nThe Browns acquired Jerry Jeudy in a trade with the Denver Broncos earlier this season and are clearly hoping he will fill the No. 2 receiver role behind Amari Cooper.\n\nIn 2023, Elijah Moore played the part, catching 59 passes for 640 yards and a couple of touchdowns. Definitely solid numbers, especially given Cleveland's quarterback situation last year. But the Browns are obviously aiming for a higher ceiling.\n\nJeudy could provide them with that. Operative word: could.\n\nThe 25-year-old has actually been a major disappointment since being drafted 15th overall back in 2020. He has yet to register a 1,000-yard campaign, topping out at 972 in 2022. In Jeudy's defense, he missed two games that season, so he probably would have hit 1,000 if he were healthy.\n\nBut close only counts in horseshoes, and the fact that he only registered 758 yards in 16 games this past season doesn't exactly help his case.\n\nIf Jeudy can realize his potential or at least play the way he did in 2022, the Browns will suddenly have an impressive stable of wide receivers, not to mention a terrific tight end in David Njoku. Watson will absolutely have no shortage of weapons at his disposal in that case.\n\nOf course, Jeudy actually needs to go out on the field and prove himself.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medial collateral ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Flacco", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Flacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameis_Winston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jameis Winston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jeudy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jeudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Onta_Foreman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D'Onta Foreman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Njoku", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Njoku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amari Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3231,h_1817,x_0,y_141/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/browns_digest/01j0p1kjs7w9cjavkff1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660084", "eventUri": "eng-9660084", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-06-", "textStart": 86, "textEnd": 93}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

That came after the 2022 leading rusher Chubb suffered a season ending knee injury in Week 2 against the Steelers.\n\nDespite having both players back for much, if not all of the season, the team is viewed to finish with a worse record than last season, mainly due to the schedule. Cleveland faces both NFC East playoff teams from a year ago, the Cowboys and Eagles, as well as the Dolphins and Chiefs in addition to the competitive division slate.\n\nHowever, despite the tricky schedule, the Browns are looked at as a more than capable team of beating anyone. The team is a 1.5-point underdog (-104 on the monyeline which translates to 50.98% implied probability) in Week 1 at home against the Cowboys.\n\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press_NFL_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Garrett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Garrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Flacco", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Flacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berea,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FanDuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stefanski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stefanski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFC East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2789,h_1568,x_0,y_512/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j0rkb3f597c6kwz8wa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660084", "eventUri": "eng-9660084", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-06-", "textStart": 82, "textEnd": 89}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Given the severity of his injury, it may be a while before he factors into the Browns' running back rotation. Jerome Ford and D'Onta Foreman are likely candidates to shoulder the bulk of the workload while Chubb recovers. Pierre Strong Jr. could emerge as an excellent check-down option for Watson, as he boasts exceptional hands and 4.37 speed in the 40-yard dash, presenting a matchup problem for linebackers. Nyheim Hines, if recovered from an ACL injury sustained last July following a boating accident, could also provide a solid receiving option out of the backfield for the Browns, sharing similar attributes with Strong.\n\n2024 NFL Draft class RndPickPlayerPosCollege254Michael HallDTOhio St.385Zak ZinterOLMichigan5156Jamari ThrashWRLouisville6206Nathaniel WatsonLBMississippi St.7227Myles HardenDBSouth Dakota7243Jowon BriggsDECincinnati Browns 2024 schedule WKDATEOPPTIMETVVENUE1Sep 8, 2024vsDallas4:25 pmFOXCleveland Browns Stadium2Sep 15, 2024@Jacksonville1:00 pmCBSEverBank Stadium3Sep 22, 2024vsN.Y.

As long as Watson is ready for Week 1, he should be considered a high-end No. 2 Fantasy quarterback worth drafting with a late-round pick in all one-quarterback leagues. In Superflex and two-quarterback leagues, Watson is worth a mid-round selection. In 2023, Watson appeared in six games, and he scored at least 22.6 Fantasy points in three of them. When healthy, he still has the potential to be among the best Fantasy quarterbacks, but no one is going to draft him as a No. 1 option. The good news for Watson is the Browns added Jerry Jeudy this offseason to an already quality receiving corps with Amari Cooper, Elijah Moore and David Njoku. And Watson can still be a decent rusher with at least 22 rushing yards in four of six games in 2023. If Watson can stay healthy all season, he could emerge as a potential starter in all leagues, and he's a cheap investment this year with a late-round pick in one-quarterback formats.\n\nQB Jameis Winston\n\nWinston signed with the Browns this offseason and will back up Deshaun Watson. The former No. 1 overall pick threw for an NFL-high 5,109 yards in 2019, but his league-leading 30 interceptions were enough reason for the Buccaneers to move on, leaving Winston to see sporadic playing time with the Saints over the last four years while continuing to be responsible for big plays on both sides of the ball. He is not worth rostering in most leagues but makes for an interesting handcuff option in two-QB and Superflex leagues given Watson's injury history.\n\nRB Nick Chubb\n\nChubb has two significant things working against him this season. The first and most important is his recovery from last year's left knee injury suffered in Week 2, which was his ACL, MCL and meniscus. He's also 28, and Father Time is not on his side. But if he's healthy and ready for Week 1 then it's hard to bet against Chubb, and he's worth drafting as a high-end No. 3 running back as early as Round 6. Chubb's status will be worth monitoring in training camp, and hopefully he'll be close to 100 percent by then. The Browns have insurance for Chubb with Jerome Ford and D'Onta Foreman, and both could be factors in Cleveland even when Chubb is healthy. While Chubb might not return to his status pre-injury -- he averaged at least 15.4 PPR points per game in four seasons in a row prior to 2023 -- he can still be a starter in most leagues. Just don't overvalue Chubb because of his name and history, and keep an eye on his recovery prior to your Draft Day.\n\nRB Jerome Ford\n\nFord was the best running back for the Browns in 2023, and he could once again be the best running back in Cleveland in 2024 as well. Ford is worth drafting with a mid-round pick in all leagues, especially if Nick Chubb (knee) is limited in his recovery in training camp. Last year, Ford took over for Chubb in Week 2 and averaged a career-best 12.4 PPR points per game. He did that while sharing touches with Kareem Hunt, and Ford showed he can be productive in tandem. This season, Ford could share touches with Chubb or D'Onta Foreman if Chubb is limited to open the year, but the worst-case scenario for everyone in Cleveland would be if all three running backs get touches. Most likely, Ford and Chubb will be the main two options in the Browns backfield, and Ford could help Fantasy managers get off to a good start this season if Chubb is still limited. Ford has plenty of sleeper appeal in 2024.\n\nRB D'Onta Foreman\n\nForeman signed with the Browns this offseason, and he's expected to be a reserve running back in Cleveland this year. Foreman is not worth drafting in the majority of leagues. Now, Foreman could have a bigger role than expected if Nick Chubb (knee) is limited to open the season, but Foreman would still have to contend with Jerome Ford in that scenario. And if Chubb is ready for Week 1 then Foreman would be third on the depth chart at best. However, keep in mind that Foreman has been buried on the depth chart in previous stops in Tennessee in 2021, Carolina in 2022 and Chicago in 2023, but he's found a way to get significant touches due to injury. And in two of those seasons (2021 and 2023), Foreman averaged at least 10.1 PPR points per game. Most likely, Foreman will go undrafted in most leagues, but he could be someone to add off the waiver wire if Chubb misses any time early in the season.\n\nRB Pierre Strong Jr.\n\nStrong returns to the Browns backfield in 2024 as a reserve running back, but he's not worth drafting in the majority of leagues. Strong will open the season behind Nick Chubb, Jerome Ford and D'Onta Foreman, and it's hard to envision Strong getting much playing time unless there are multiple injuries. In 2023, Strong didn't have much of an impact for the Browns and Fantasy managers even when Chubb (knee) was injured, and he likely won't make much of an impact again this season. At best, you can add Strong off the waiver wire if he starts off the season playing well.\n\nWR Amari Cooper\n\nCooper should once again be the best receiver for the Browns, and we'll see if he can be among the best Fantasy receivers as well. We view him as a high-end No. 3 Fantasy receiver this season, and he's worth drafting as early as Round 5 in all leagues. In 2023, Cooper set a career-high with 1,250 yards, and he also added 72 receptions and five touchdowns on 128 targets in 15 games. He did this despite playing with four different quarterbacks in Deshaun Watson, Joe Flacco, Dorian Thompson-Robinson and P.J. Walker. Watson (shoulder) will return as the starter this season, and that's good news for Cooper. But he also turns 30 in June, and the Browns added Jerry Jeudy this offseason to go with Cooper, Elijah Moore and David Njoku. There's a lot to like about Cooper at the right price, but don't reach for him on Draft Day just because of his history. He's entering the point in his career where he could start to see a downturn in production.\n\nWR Jerry Jeudy\n\nAfter four tough years with the Broncos, Jeudy was traded to the Browns this offseason. He'll attempt to put together his second season with at least 10 PPR points per game, though it won't be easy. The Browns already have Amari Cooper as their primary threat (7.8 targets per game with Deshaun Watson last year) and got an outstanding season from tight end David Njoku. Jeudy would have to carve out a role larger than what he had in Denver and then rediscover the kind of efficiency he had in 2022 in order to be a good Fantasy choice. That feels unlikely, even with the quarterback upgrade, which is why Jeudy is best viewed as a bench receiver worth taking in the double-digit rounds.\n\nWR Elijah Moore\n\nMoore enters this season competing for targets in what has become a crowded Cleveland receiving corps. Moore is only worth drafting with a late-round pick in the majority of leagues. The Browns added Jerry Jeudy this offseason, which should negatively impact Moore, especially since Amari Cooper and David Njoku should also command plenty of attention. In 2023, Moore's first season in Cleveland, he dealt with five different quarterbacks in Deshaun Watson, Joe Flacco, Dorian Thompson-Robinson, P.J. Walker and Jeff Driskel, and Moore averaged just 7.8 PPR points per game. Hopefully, with a full season of Watson, Moore can perform at a higher level. But he has to prove he should be among the team's target leaders this season, and that could be difficult with all the mouths to feed for the Browns. Most likely, we could see Moore on the waiver wire early in the season, and if he starts out playing well then add him where available.\n\nWR Cedric Tillman\n\nTillman is expected to be the No. 4 receiver for the Browns this season, but he has minimal Fantasy value in that role. He's not worth drafting in the majority of leagues. Cleveland has a crowded receiving corps with Amari Cooper, Jerry Jeudy and Elijah Moore, and Tillman could struggle for targets. As a rookie, the 2023 third-round pick recorded a 21-224-0 line on 44 targets in 14 regular-season games, but hopefully better quarterback play could help with Deshaun Watson (shoulder) back at 100 percent. There's a chance Tillman could surprise us and be more of a factor on offense, but let him prove himself first. He could be someone to add off the waiver wire during the year.\n\nWR David Bell\n\nBell is expected to be the No. 5 receiver for the Browns this season, but he has minimal Fantasy value in that role. He's not worth drafting in the majority of leagues. Cleveland has Amari Cooper, Jerry Jeudy, Elijah Moore and Cedric Tillman ahead of Bell on the depth chart, and David Njoku is also a significant factor as well. Bell has struggled to produce in two years, averaging 3.3 PPR points per game or less in each season, and that's unlikely to change in 2024. At best, you can add Bell off the waiver wire if he starts off the season playing well.\n\nWR Jamari Thrash\n\nThe Browns selected Thrash in the fifth round of the NFL Draft, and he should provide some depth for Cleveland this season. Thrash is not worth drafting in most redraft leagues, and he's a flier at best in rookie-only drafts for Dynasty leagues. The Browns have a crowded receiving corps with Amari Cooper, Jerry Jeudy and Elijah Moore, and Cedric Tillman and David Bell are also expected to be ahead of Thrash on the depth chart. We'll see if he can make plays when he gets on the field, and the Louisville product had 63 catches for 858 yards and six touchdowns in 2023. At best, you can add Thrash off the waiver wire if he starts off the season playing well.\n\nTE David Njoku\n\nNjoku had a career season in 2023, and we'll see if he can produce at a high level once again this year. He's worth drafting as a low-end No. 1 Fantasy tight end in all leagues with a mid- to late-round pick. Njoku averaged a career-best 12.6 PPR points per game last season, but you have to look at his 2024 campaign in two parts. He was great with Joe Flacco to end the season, but Njoku struggled with Deshaun Watson, who will be the starter in 2024. Njoku scored 6.8 PPR points or less in three of five games with Watson, but he scored at least 16.4 PPR points in each of his final four games with Flacco. We're hopeful Njoku can be more productive with Watson this year, and a full season together should help. Njoku is a good tight end to wait for on Draft Day in all leagues, but don't reach for him based solely on last year's success.\n\nTE Jordan Akins\n\nAkins is expected to be the No. 2 tight end for the Browns this season, but he has minimal Fantasy value in that role. He's not worth drafting in the majority of leagues. David Njoku is the No. 1 tight end for the Browns, and he's the primary receiving threat at the position. Cleveland also has Amari Cooper, Jerry Jeudy and Elijah Moore as the top receivers, and Akins should struggle to earn targets. In 2023, he averaged just 1.7 PPR points per game, and the best season of his career was 7.7 PPR points per game in 2022 with Houston. At best, you can add Akins off the waiver wire if he starts off the season playing well.\n\nK Dustin Hopkins\n\nHopkins is the starting kicker for the Browns, and he should be considered a low-end No. 1 Fantasy option. He's worth drafting with a last-round pick in all leagues. Hopkins had a solid season in 2023 with 33 made field goals on 36 attempts, including going 8-of-8 on kicks from 50-plus yards. And he made 24-of-26 PATs. The Browns offense should give Hopkins plenty of chances to score, and he should have the chance for another quality campaign in 2024.\n\nBrowns DST\n\nThe Browns defense should be considered one of the best in the NFL this season, and the Browns DST is worth drafting with a late-round pick in all leagues. Defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz has plenty of tools at his disposal, including one of the NFL's best pass rushers in Myles Garrett. Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah is one of the top linebackers in the league, and Denzel Ward is a top corner. Last year, the Browns were No. 6 in sacks (49), tied for third in interceptions (18) and No. 1 in yards against (4,593). It should be another standout season for the Cleveland defense, and the Browns DST has top-five upside in all leagues.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandon_howard@cbssports.com", "name": "Brandon Howard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Ford", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Ford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jeudy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jeudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Onta_Foreman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "D'Onta Foreman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Njoku", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Njoku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amari Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medial collateral ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Flacco", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Flacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Strong_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Strong Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyheim_Hines", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nyheim Hines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_of_schedule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strength of schedule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M&T_Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M&T Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bye (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "P.

Watson is the quarterback for the Cleveland Browns. He will be gearing up for his first full season with the Browns after sitting through an 11-game suspension to start the previous season. Nevertheless, we will be focusing in on Deshaun Watson's net worth in 2023.\n\nWhat is Deshaun Watson's net worth in 2024?: $60 million (estimate)\n\nDeshaun Watson's net worth in 2024 is $50 million. This is according to numerous reputable outlets, including the forever useful Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nDeshaun Watson was born in Gainesville, Ga., where he played high school football for Gainesville High School. He became the school's quarterback in his freshman year.\n\nIn his high school career, Watson set state records for total yards, total touchdowns, career passing yards, and career passing touchdowns en route to a state championship and a Junior All-American selection in his third year.\n\nHe was the 2014 Player to Watch and 2014 Top 100 Recruit. Watson had numerous scholarship offers but eventually verbally agreed to join Clemson University as the top quarterback recruit for the 2014 class.\n\nDeshaun Watson plays football for Clemson\n\nWatson played three years of college football with the Clemson Tigers. He threw for 10,168 yards with 90 touchdowns and rushed for 1,934 yards with 26 touchdowns.\n\nDeshaun Watson was selected with the 12 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft by the Houston Texans. He signed a four-year $13.85 million rookie contract with an $8.21 million signing bonus.\n\nUnfortunately, Watson only played for 7 games in his rookie season after he suffered a torn ACL on a non-contact play in practice. Despite that, he was still ranked No. 50 by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018. He was also named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team.\n\nThe following season, Watson bounced back strongly as he started all 16 regular-season games for the Texans as he threw for 4,165 yards with 26 touchdowns and only 9 interceptions. He also rushed for 551 yards with five touchdowns. Watson was named to his first-ever Pro Bowl, replacing the Super Bowl-bound Tom Brady.\n\nPrior to the 2020 season, Deshaun Watson signed a lucrative four-year $156 million contract with a $27 million signing bonus and up to $111 million guaranteed upon signing. Deshaun Watson led the NFL in passing yards with 4,823 yards as he became the first player to lead the league in passing yards on a team with 12 losses since 1997. He was also named to his third straight Pro Bowl.\n\nDeshaun Watson embroiled in controversy\n\nUnfortunately, prior to the 2021 season, Deshaun Watson requested a trade after changes in the front office and coaching staff left him disgruntled. Aside from that, he also has off-field controversies that he is going through. Despite that, he still participated in team practices and training and was included in the 53-man roster to start the season.\n\nThe off-field controversy included numerous women accusing Watson of lewd sexual behavior and even assault. Police conducted an investigation, and no charges were filed. However, there were over 20 civil lawsuits filed against Watson, which were settled privately.\n\nDeshaun Watson is traded and suspended\n\nIn March 2022, the Cleveland Browns traded three first-round picks to acquire Watson. The Browns also signed Watson to a fully guaranteed five-year, $230 million contract. All this came about despite the NFL was still investigating the accusations against Watson.\n\nJust before the start of the season, the NFL handed Watson an 11-game suspension, which included a fine of $5 million. Ironically, Watson's first game with the Browns after the suspension came against the Texans in Houston. Watson struggled with injuries in his first season before finally having to have season-ending surgery on his throwing shoulder.\n\nWatson only played in six games in his first season in Cleveland. He is expected to be ready for the start of the 2024 season.\n\nDeshaun Watson's endorsement earnings\n\nDeshaun Watson earns an estimated $8 million from endorsements alone. He has deals with Beats by Dre, DraftKings, Epix, Gillette, Miller Lite, Nike, Oikos, Raising Cane's, Reliant Energy, Rocket Mortgage, Samsung, Verizon, Zurvita, H-E-B, and Rolex.\n\nHowever, due to the sexual allegations against Watson, Nike, Beats by Dre, Reliant Energy, and H-E-B suspended their endorsement deals with Watson -- the latter two stating that they do not plan to renew their deals with Watson in the future. According to Forbes, Watson is only making $500,000 in endorsements in 2023.\n\nNevertheless, were you at all surprised by Deshaun Watson's net worth in 2024?", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com",

It doesn't take much guts to say that Cleveland Browns QB Deshaun Watson has not been good since joining the team. Given that, his injury history and time away from the game, it also is easy to predict a mediocre season for Watson in 2024.\n\nThere are also reasons for optimism starting with the addition of WR Jerry Jeudy to an offense that already has Amari Cooper, David Njoku and Elijah Moore catching passes. The potential return of RB Nick Chubb is also encouraging.\n\nHow the Browns offense will look as HC Kevin Stefanski and new OC Ken Dorsey work together is still a bit of a mystery. According to Albert Breer, things seem to be coming together:\n\nWord I've gotten is it's been pretty cool to see the whole thing coalesce. Turning the page allowed the team to tailor the scheme a little more for Deshaun Watson, something the Browns started on during the 2023 offseason...\n\nFor his part, Dorsey brings experience working with athletic dynamos at quarterback, in Cam Newton and Josh Allen, and the work he did with the guys who were able to build offenses for them. So, the Browns are optimistic here. Or at least cautiously so.\n\nInterestingly, last year's offense led the league in air yards (amount passes traveled in the air):\n\nMany will assume big-armed Joe Flacco was the reason for the number but he only played in five of 17 games for the Browns last year.\n\nThe addition of Juedy and the new offense catered around Watson has Emory Hunt, a national analyst for CBS Sports, betting the over for Cleveland's quarterback this year:\n\nFor Browns fans, Watson's \"touchdown to check down\" mindset, according to Hunt, is something that could be frustrating at times but leads to the type of big plays necessary in the NFL these days. That mindset also often leads to a few more sacks taken as the quarterback waits for things to develop.\n\nAt this point in Cleveland's Super Bowl window, competing against Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs (among a slew of other great team/QB combos) requires high risk/high reward not playing it safe.\n\nFor now, the safe assumption is that Watson will not return to the player he was with the Houston Texans. It takes courage, as Hunt shows above, but you can see a way for the Browns QB to explode in 2024 if everything goes right.", "source": {"uri": "dawgsbynature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawgs By Nature"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jared_mueller@dawgsbynature.com", "name": "Jared Mueller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jeudy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jeudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stefanski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stefanski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Dorsey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ken Dorsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Njoku", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Njoku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amari Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Newton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cam Newton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Flacco", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Flacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ReMydSKc0tAubHL_uT0h10c5rg=/0x0:4422x2211/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25496126/2156786774.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660084", "eventUri": "eng-9660084", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

They could be legitimate Super Bowl contenders, or they could miss the playoffs entirely.\n\nSure, that is the case for many ballclubs, but I'm not sure there are many teams with as much of a differential between their ceiling and their floor than the Browns.\n\nCleveland is extraordinary talented, as evidenced by the fact that it won 11 games last season in site of employing five different starting quarterbacks. Not only that, but the Browns play in the league's toughest division in the AFC North.\n\nWith such high expectations for Cleveland this coming season, here are three Browns players facing make or break campagins in 2024.\n\nThe Browns acquired Jerry Jeudy in a trade with the Denver Broncos earlier this offseason. It was for the cheap cost of fifth and sixth-round draft picks, so it was certainly a low-risk, potentially high-reward move for Cleveland.\n\nJeudy will step into the No. 2 receiver role behind Amari Cooper for the Browns, which will slide Elijah Moore down to third on the depth chart.\n\nBut many are wondering: is Jeudy really that big of an upgrade over Moore?\n\nThe 25-year-old was selected by the Broncos with the 15th pick of the 2020 NFL Draft, but has been a rather significant disappointment thus far. He has failed to crack 1,000 yards in any of his first four NFL seasons, topping out at 972 in 2022. This past year, Jeudy actually took a step back, catching 54 passes for 758 yards and a couple of touchdowns.\n\nCleveland handed the University of Alabama product a three-year contract extension worth up to $58 million upon acquiring him, so Jeudy has a live to up to in 2024 and beyond.\n\nWe'll see if Jeudy can flourish in his new surroundings come September.\n\nGreg Newsome II has been a fine contributor in the Browns' secondary since being taken with the 26th pick of the 2021 NFL Draft.\n\nThis past year, Newsome registered 49 tackles, a half of a sack, a pair of interceptions, 14 passes defended and a defensive touchdown in 14 games. He also earned himself a solid 69.6 grade from Pro Football Focus. Plus, he still has two years remaining on his rookie deal.\n\nWhy, then, did Newsome make this list?\n\nWell, the Chicago native had been the subject of trade speculation earlier this offseason, as he became eligible for a contract extension and doesn't seem incredibly likely to land one given that Cleveland is already paying fellow cornerback Denzel Ward big money. Plus, Martin Emerson Jr. may be an emerging star.\n\nEssentially, Newsome is playing for his future with the Browns. If he ends up having an off year in 2024, Cleveland could very well jettison him to avoid paying his fifth-year option in 2025, which would run the club $13.4 million.\n\nThis is an absolute no-brainer.\n\nDeshaun Watson is entering his third season with the Browns, but he has only played 12 games since his arrival. He served an 11-game suspension during his debut campaign, and last season, he bowed out after just six contests due to a season-ending shoulder injury that would ultimately require surgery.\n\nWatson is in line to be ready for Week 1, but how much rust will he have? Remember: Watson also sat out all of 2021, which was his final year with the Houston Texans. He was traded to Cleveland that ensuing March. That means Watson has only participated in 12 games total in three seasons.\n\nThe 28-year-old was brilliant in 2020, leading the NFL with 4,823 passing yards to go along with 33 touchdowns and seven interceptions. But does Watson still have that in him? After all, that was four years ago, which is essentially a lifetime in professional football.\n\nThis may very well be Watson's last chance in Cleveland. If he delivers and resembles his former Texans self, the Browns may very well be Super Bowl contenders. If not? Cleveland may have to seriously consider going to the Denver Broncos route, which would mean cutting ties with Watson and his expensive contract -- like the Broncos did with Russell Wilson -- and finding a new quarterback.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Newsome_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greg Newsome II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jeudy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jeudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amari Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Ward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Ward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2633,h_1481,x_0,y_298/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/browns_digest/01j0rqq52zqf95ykvs4b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660084", "eventUri": "eng-9660084", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-06-", "textStart": 86, "textEnd": 93}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

He cares so little that he blocks all the sheep who chirp (bleat?) him -- or whom he perceives to be chirping/bleating -- on social media. And he alludes to the sheep's lion power rankings during an offseason interview, not that he's ever read the rankings or put any stock into them.\n\n\"... I don't get involved with people trying to rate me places where they think I'm at the bottom of the list,\" Browns lion, er, quarterback Deshaun Watson said last week at minicamp. \"It is what it is. If I was at the bottom, no one would talk about me. So obviously if anyone is talking about me and going to continue to talk about me, then I must be pretty damn good.\"\n\nOne sheep's opinion? Watson cares plenty about his place in the NFL's passing hierarchy, as evidenced by his answer to a question that did not allude to any quarterback list or his ranking therein. He also seems to know where he stands on your favorite internet QB list, because most of them do feature him toward the end.\n\nThe Ringer ranked him 25th exiting the 2023 season, which is four spots behind Giants QB Daniel Jones. Pro Football focus ranked him 23rd (four spots behind Bears rookie Caleb Williams) as of last month. And the 33rd Team slotted Watson 27th, one spot behind Cardinals backup Desmond Ridder, entering the offseason.\n\nIf Browns fans think those beliefs are ridiculous, wait 'til they hear this one: I think it's a good thing that Watson's profile has fallen so far since he joined the Browns two years ago, to the point where it could help him play better in 2024.\n\nYou could call this false hope for a fan base desperate for its highest-paid player to play well. Or you could call it a belief in the power of underselling and overdelivering. But I think we can all agree that the pressure Watson has felt in Cleveland to deliver on the promise he showed with the Texans has hindered his ability to recreate it, which is why he could benefit from lower, more tempered expectations in 2024.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Watson should and will feel an urgency to perform given that the Browns (quite literally) can't afford to wait on his resurgence much longer. And the quarterback's play will be dissected both locally and nationally regardless of the numbers he produces. But after 12 games and fourteen touchdown passes in two years, the outside standards for Watson's success feel lower and more manageable heading into next season. And though he'll be chasing his own goals, it might help to earn more grace during his return from shoulder surgery, even if that grace is rooted in doubt that he can become the player Cleveland traded and paid for two years ago.\n\nRemember that guy? Browns fans expected Watson to play like the man who made three straight Pro Bowls from 2018-20 when he first arrived. They expected to see the quarterback who led the league in passing yards while throwing to Brandin Cooks, Will Fuller and Randall Cobb in 2020. They expected a top-five quarterback because that's how NFL.com viewed him after his last season in Houston.\n\nSounds like a heavy standard to shoulder, even for a healthy quarterback with a reputation that doesn't need repairing. In fact, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is the only passer who has made three Pro Bowls over the last three seasons. And only future legends and superstars should be compared to Mahomes, the two-time MVP and three-time Super Bowl champion.\n\nThe Browns once thought (and perhaps still think) Watson belonged in that company. And along with their fans, they hope he can play his way into that conversation again. But the best news for Cleveland's lion is that most sheep don't believe he will.\n\nWatson can say he cares not about public perception, just like he can block every social media hater he perceives. But the more Watson proclaims his indifference to both, the more he sounds to me like he cares. The more a player considers his reputation, the more I believe it hinders the freedom with which they play. And the more Watson diverges from the free-flowing playstyle he showcased in Houston, the more Cleveland worries about its investment at quarterback.\n\nSo the less bleating he hears from the sheep, the better off he'll be this offseason. Watson has fallen out of top quarterback conversations since 2022, but that might be the perfect place to find him entering a crucial third year in Cleveland.

It heads into a big season waiting for Watson to fully recover from surgery to repair a fractured glenoid in his throwing shoulder, a rare and serious injury for a quarterback.\n\nThe Browns have spent big to build a team they believe is ready to become a real AFC contender, and when Watson engineered a big comeback in Baltimore last November, the Browns seemed ready for a leap. But that turned out to be Watson's last game of 2023, and the Browns then went through two more quarterbacks before Joe Flacco and their defense pushed them to the playoffs.\n\nAmari Cooper is back for the final year of his contract. Myles Garrett is the reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year and has shown that he can change games in multiple ways. The Browns think they have the pieces, the coaches and the continuity to make another big late-season run. But they need Watson to deliver to prevent this window from closing quickly.\n\nOFFENSE\n\nWatson won't be fully cleared until the summer. The Browns added Jameis Winston and Tyler Huntley as veteran backups and insurance policies, but it's Watson who will either deliver or miss when it comes to this team's high hopes and expectations. Flacco saved the Browns last December, but the Browns didn't offer Flacco a new contract, and they know they can't count on any backup to replicate what Flacco did.\n\nNick Chubb has arguably been the NFL's best running back when healthy, but Chubb is recovering from two surgeries to repair the torn ACL and MCL he suffered last September. The Browns expect Chubb back but won't rush him, so they added veterans Nyheim Hines and D'Onta Foreman to compete for snaps with Jerome Ford, who became the No. 1 back in Chubb's absence last year. Hines is also recovering from a torn ACL, and speedy third-year player Pierre Strong Jr. could also make the roster again after emerging as a top special teams performer last season.\n\nThe receiving corps still has Cooper as the clear-cut No. 1, but the Browns also view tight end David Njoku as a top-level playmaker after his big 2023 season. Njoku didn't really take off until after Watson's injury, so getting them connected is another area on which the Browns will focus this summer. Jerry Jeudy was acquired via trade then given a big extension, which seems a risky bet given his rather unremarkable time in Denver. But the Browns believe that Jeudy gives them speed they didn't previously have and that the fifth-year wideout will be in a better offensive environment in Cleveland.\n\nRelated: Athlon Sports 2024 NFL Team Previews\n\nThe team hopes to see a second-year leap from Cedric Tillman, who's a big target on the perimeter. The arrival of Jeudy presumably means fewer snaps for Elijah Moore, who's entering the final year of his rookie contract. Moore had an up-and-down first year in Cleveland, but the Browns think he's explosive enough to contribute from the slot. Others fighting for jobs and snaps at wide receiver include James Proche II, David Bell and rookie Jamari Thrash.\n\nThough longtime offensive line coach Bill Callahan departed, the Browns are in the rare spot of returning six starters to their offensive line. The biggest questions are at tackle, where left tackle Jedrick Wills Jr. is only under contract for 2024, and the right tackle spot remains uncertain. Jack Conklin has guaranteed money on his contract that runs through 2026, but Conklin is trying to work his way back from a second torn ACL. Dawand Jones took over for Conklin and was outstanding for much of his rookie season, but Jones also missed the final month of the season with a knee injury. Jones has rare size and talent, and the Browns have high hopes assuming he can stay healthy.\n\nPro Bowl guards Joel Bitonio and Wyatt Teller are also back, but probably only for one more year given the amount of money the Browns have spent on the offensive line. Bitonio has long been one of the league's best left guards and heads to his 11th NFL season. Teller, who turns 30 this summer, is a mauler in the run game. Conklin might or might not be ready to return by the start of the season, and there will be a camp battle for interior backup roles involving veterans Michael Dunn and Brian Allen and two young players, Luke Wypler and third-round rookie Zak Zinter.\n\nDEFENSE\n\nLast year's defense was inconsistent overall, but the pass rush consistently delivered. Coordinator Jim Schwartz wants his players to attack first, and he believes that constantly pressuring opposing quarterbacks pays dividends even when it doesn't directly result in sacks or turnovers.\n\nWith Schwartz's style and Garrett's talents in mind, bringing back veteran front-line players Za'Darius Smith and Shelby Harris topped the team's offseason priority list. Veteran linebacker Jordan Hicks was added, too, in large part because he previously played under Schwartz in Philadelphia. Linebacker Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah is coming off of his best season, and he has the range and instincts to continue to develop.\n\nAt its best, this group is hard to block. Dalvin Tomlinson commands enough attention on the interior to allow the linebackers to take chances, while Garrett, Smith and Ogbo Okoronkwo loom as a nightmare for opposing quarterbacks, offensive tackles and play-callers.\n\nThe Browns have arguably the league's best cornerback trio in Denzel Ward, Martin Emerson Jr. and Greg Newsome II. Schwartz asks his cornerbacks to play a lot of man coverage and take big-play chances when appropriate, so it's no surprise that Ward had arguably his best season.\n\nSafety Grant Delpit was good enough last year to earn a contract extension, but the team needs more from veteran safety Juan Thornhill in his second year with the team.\n\nSPECIALISTS\n\nThe Browns feel that their special teams units will be good enough to swing games. Kicker went from a concern to a spot of confidence after the team added Dustin Hopkins last August, but he didn't finish the season due to a hamstring injury. Hopkins has been good when healthy and tied a franchise record for made field goals last season, but his injury history remains a concern.\n\nPunter Corey Bojorquez had another strong season in 2023 and got a new contract in March 2024, and the Browns count on Bojorquez to flip the field and to deliver in what can be difficult Cleveland weather. The return jobs will be settled in training camp, but the Browns added Hines in large part because of his history as a kickoff returner and the new rules changes designed to make kickoff returns a more important part of the game. Also in the return mix will be Ford, Moore, Proche and Strong.\n\nFINAL ANALYSIS\n\nThe Browns have spent big to build (and retain) this roster. A year after winning 11 games under wild circumstances and then no-showing in the playoffs, expectations are high. But the Browns will only meet them if their key players can stay healthy and Watson can finally deliver over the course of an entire season.\n\nRelated: Athlon Sports 2024 NFL Preview Magazine Now

Mandatory Credit: Jessica Rapfogel-USA TODAY Sports / Jessica Rapfogel-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAdd the Madden rating creators to the list of people doubting Deshaun Watson's chances of returning to a top 10 quarterback this season.\n\nThe go-to football video game recently rolled out their player ratings for this year's games and Browns fans certainly won't like to see where their star QB showed up among the rest of the NFL's signal callers. With an overall grade of 74, Watson is the 24th rated QB in the game.\n\nThat put him behind all the other AFC North quarterbacks, including both of the Steelers new QBs in Russell Wilson and Justin Fields. That duo actually came in a couple slots ahead of Watson, with Wilson being ranked 21st with an overall rating of 75. Meanwhile, Fields' 76 overall rating earned him the 20th spot, one ahead of his new teammate who is expected to at least start the season under center.\n\nSharing a rating of 74 with Watson, the Colts young QB Anthony Richardson comes in at No. 23. 10-year veteran Derek Carr of the Saints falls in at No. 22 with a rating of 75. Meanwhile, Pittsburgh's 2022 first-round pick Kenny Pickett - who they traded to the Eagles this offseason - is just one spot behind Watson with a rating of 73.\n\nAs for the other two AFC North QBs, both Lamar Jackson of the Ravens and Joe Burrow of the Bengals are part of a star-studded top three quarterbacks, headlined by the No. 1 overall rated player in the game, Patrick Mahomes.\n\nEntering year three of his five-year deal with the Browns, Watson apparently has a lot to prove on an actual football field and a virtual one in 2024.\n\nAndrew Berry On Nick Chubb: \"He's The Heartbeat And Pulse Of Our Team\"\n\nBrowns' Wide Receiver Amari Cooper is a \"Big Part of Our Team\"\n\nRemembering The Best Moments From The Browns Last Appearance On Hard Knocks\n\nBrowns To Be Part Of \"Hard Knocks\" In Season Series Featuring AFC North", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M&T_Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M&T Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Pickett", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Pickett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Knocks_(2001_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hard Knocks (2001 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Carr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derek Carr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amari Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3202,h_1801,x_0,y_28/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/browns_digest/01j0p6trwgn4bbhbrzg8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660084", "eventUri": "eng-9660084", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-11-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports / Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports\n\nCleveland Browns wide receiver Amari Cooper is currently embroiled in a contract dispute with the team. He skipped organized team activities (which were voluntary) and also did not attend mandatory minicamp (which was not voluntary, hence the word \"mandatory\"), which has some wondering if Cooper will also hold out of training camp next month.\n\nIf the Browns aren't able to reach a new deal with Cooper by then, there probably is a good chance that Cooper will miss training camp, as well.\n\nThe good news is that Cleveland may be motivated to get something done before then to avoid that potential mess.\n\nDuring an appearance on 92.3 The Fan on Thursday morning, Browns insider Mary Kay Cabot said she feels the two sides will be able to strike a pact.\n\n\"Both sides should be able to find a path forward here,\" Cabot said. \"I think there is a number that should work for both sides. I think there is a length of contract that they can both feel comfortable with.\"\n\nCabot added that Deshaun Watson placing his stamp of approval on Cooper may really push Cleveland to come to terms with the star pass-catcher.\n\n\"When your quarterback, when Deshaun Watson goes to bat for a player like that, and says he's the best in the game, I think that's telling,\" Cabot said. \"He's putting his two cents in for the Browns to get this thing done. ... That was his vote of confidence in Amari Cooper, saying we need him on this football team to get done what we want to.\"\n\nSome have expressed some concern over the idea of handing Cooper a lucrative long-term extension given the fact that he is 30 years old. Plus, while Cooper is certainly very good, he isn't on the same level as fellow receivers like Justin Jefferson, A.J. Brown and Amon-Ra St. Brown, all of whom secured new deals this offseason.\n\nThat being said, Cooper is clearly the Browns' No. 1 receiver. Jerry Jeudy and Elijah Moore represent solid secondary and tertiary options for Watson, but they absolutely are not top-tier wide outs.\n\nIf this standoff between Cooper and Cleveland continues into the regular season, the Browns could be in some trouble.\n\nCooper is entering the final year of his current deal and hauled in 72 receptions for 1,250 yards and five touchdowns in 2023.

However, in back-to-back seasons, he has been disappointing and has dealt with injury issues.\n\nWinston needs to be ready to play this season. Even though the team would rather see Winston sit on the bench the entire season, because it would mean that Watson is performing well, they need to prepare for the possibility that Winston will end up on the field.\n\nThat has led to Factory of Sadness writer Sayre Bedinger to list Winston getting plenty of reps with the starters as a major priority for Cleveland.\n\n\"This may seem like a little bit of a hot take, but if the last two years have shown us anything, it's that the Cleveland Browns need to be overly prepared in case Deshaun Watson doesn't play much this coming season.

Injuries took that opportunity away from him.\n\nDuring that season, Winston played in seven games. He completed just 59 percent of his pass attempts, but threw for 1,170 yards, 14 touchdowns, and just three interceptions.\n\nWhile his momentum did not carry on with the Saints, he's still an above average backup quarterback. He's more than capable of stepping in and starting if the Browns need him.\n\nMaking sure that he receives some reps with the starters should be a priority.

That hasn't been by accident either. Playing in a cold-weather city and on the shores of Lake Erie, football in the Hardland is typically described as \"ground and pound.\"\n\nHead coach Kevin Stefanski and general manager Andrew Berry have attempted to change this since the NFL is such a pass-happy league, but they're still at their best when they control the clock with the ground game. Having said that, the teams that have the best quarterbacks typically win the most Super Bowls, which is why they gambled on Deshaun Watson.\n\nCleveland, who has yet to win a Super Bowl, has still had its share of solid quarterbacks during its storied existence. These 10 quarterbacks are proof of that as they have each made a name for themselves as the best to ever suit up for the Browns.\n\nThe top 10 quarterbacks in Cleveland Browns history\n\nDespite going 10-3-1 and making it to the Championship Game with Bill Nelson under center, the Browns swung a huge trade for a premium quarterback in the 1970 NFL Draft. They even traded a fan favorite in the process.\n\nWide receiver Paul Warfield was sent to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for the third overall selection. That pick was used on Mike Phipps out of Purdue.\n\nPhipps spent two seasons behind Nelson, finally taking over as the full-time starter in 1972. He led Cleveland to a record of 10-3 and then 7-5-2 in 1973. Those were the only two winning seasons he had as the starter. Phipps also struggled in his lone playoff start, going 9-for-23 for 131 yards with a touchdown and five picks.\n\nIn 1977, he was traded to the Chicago Bears. Phipps finished his time in Cleveland with 51 starts in seven seasons, leading the Browns to a record of 24-25-2. He still stands ninth in team history with 7,770 yards and 11th with 40 touchdown passes.\n\nTim Couch will forever be known as the leader of the Browns' re-birth. In 1999, the franchise returned to the NFL, and as an expansion team, it had the No. 1 pick in the draft. That selection was used to bring in Couch, who had a stellar career at Kentucky.\n\nFacing the impossible task of leading a roster devoid of depth, Couch has been unfairly labeled a bust by pundits outside of Cleveland. The truth, however, is that he was a good quarterback who took a beating behind a poor offensive line.\n\nDespite a 2-12 record as the starter during his rookie campaign, Couch had several memorable moments to prove he had the talent. None were more memorable than when he delivered the city its first NFL win in 1,409 days. Dramatically, Couch threw a Hail Mary to Kevin Johnson to knock off the New Orleans Saints on Halloween.\n\nThe Browns continued to move in the right direction with Couch, who led them to a 7-9 mark in 2001 and then 8-6 in 2002. They made the playoffs that season, but Couch was sidelined and Kelly Holcomb was under center. He had a heroic effort of his own, but the Browns still fell short.\n\nCouch is sixth in franchise history with 11,131 yards and eighth in touchdowns with 64. He deserves praise for the work he did during his short five seasons.\n\nDespite having some success during his short tenure with Cleveland, Vinny Testaverde is often remembered for pushing one of the more beloved players in franchise history out the door.\n\nThe 1987 No. 1 overall pick out of Miami, Testaverde spent six seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He hit free agency in 1993 and was signed by Bill Belichick. Originally the backup to Bernie Kosar, a former teammate at Miami, Testaverde was moved into the starting lineup after six games.\n\nFollowing a 3-3 record as the starter in 1993, Testaverde and the Browns improved in 1994. That year, they won 10 games and were 9-4 with the veteran quarterback starting. That was enough to make it into the postseason, where they secured a win over the New England Patriots on the road. Testaverde was impressive in that victory, throwing for 268 yards and a touchdown on 20-for-30 passing.\n\nIn just 37 games (31 starts) with the franchise, Testaverde made it into the top 10 with 7,255 passing yards and was ninth with 47 touchdowns. Still, the most impressive stat on his resume was the road win in the postseason, which was the final one the franchise had until January 2021.\n\nJust a couple of years after Otto Graham rode off into the sunset, the Browns added Milt Plum in the second round of the NFL Draft. There were fewer teams in the 1950s, so Plum was still just the 17th overall selection.\n\nOriginally, Plum split snaps with Tommy O'Connell but took over in 1958. He led the Browns to a record of 9-2 in his 11 starts but leaned heavily on Jim Brown and Bobby Mitchell in the run game.\n\nBy his third season, he had become a refined passer and led the NFL in completion percentage in 1959, 1960, and 1961. He played just five years with the Browns but finished eighth in team history with 8,914 yards while boasting an impressive 66-to-39 touchdown-to-interception ratio.\n\nPlum was traded to the Detroit Lions in 1962 ,and his numbers dropped. It was clear he benefited from the ground attack in Cleveland since he never recaptured the magic.\n\nTaken first overall out of Oklahoma, Baker Mayfield joined the Browns ready to help them turn their image around. They were coming off a 1-31 stretch and needed a shot in the arm. He provided that in his first appearance, coming in to replace an injured Tyrod Taylor in Week 3. The rookie led his team to a comeback win over the New York Jets on Thursday Night Football.\n\nIt was the first win the franchise had in 600 days, and it helped them go from a team that couldn't find a win to one that had the confidence to go toe-to-toe with anyone.\n\nCleveland was 6-8 in games Mayfield started (plus the win when he came in off the bench), and he set a new rookie record with 26 touchdown passes.\n\nBy 2020, he led the Browns to an 11-5 record and their first playoff berth since 2002. Cleveland even handed the Pittsburgh Steelers a loss in the Wild Card Round -- their first road playoff win since Vinny Testaverde got it done against the Patriots following the 1993 campaign.\n\nThings soured for Mayfield in 2021, and he was traded to the Carolina Panthers after the Browns landed Deshaun Watson. Despite the way things ended, Mayfield went 29-30 as a starter for a team that was struggling to find a single win every season. He should be recognized for the way he helped improve the image and confidence.\n\nA former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, Bill Nelsen was traded to Cleveland ahead of the 1968 campaign. The Browns landed him and defensive back Jim Bradshaw in exchange for defensive tackle Frank Parker and quarterback Dick Shiner.\n\nBoth teams were thrilled with the move as they each ended up with a new starting signal-caller. Nelson, who began as a backup to Frank Ryan, took over after three games. He quickly asserted himself by leading his new team to a massive upset over the then-undefeated Baltimore Colts.\n\nIn 1969, Nelsen again shocked the league by taking out an undefeated team. This time, it was the Dallas Cowboys as he threw five touchdowns in the Browns' 42-10 victory.\n\nNelsen's time with Cleveland was short-lived as injuries began to slow him down. A pinched nerve in his throwing arm and a knee injury both took a toll on him. By 1972, he found himself benched in favor of Mike Phipps. The 31-year-old started just one game that year, which was his last in the NFL.\n\nHe finished with an impressive record of 34-16-1 in the regular season and was 2-3 in the playoffs. He's also seventh in team history with 9,725 yards passing.\n\nAfter spending the first four seasons of his career as a backup with the Los Angeles Rams, Frank Ryan was traded to the Cleveland Browns in 1962. He was the No. 2 quarterback once again but didn't sit behind Jim Ninowski for long before being forced into action.\n\nNinowski suffered a broken collarbone in late October, and Ryan took the reins. He started seven games that year, leading Cleveland to a 3-3-1 record. He didn't fill up the stat sheet but had a respectable 1,541 yards with 10 touchdowns and seven picks.\n\nWhile those numbers were fine, it was the leadership he showed that kept him under center. Ryan went on to start the following five seasons, twice leading the Browns to double-digit wins while making four playoff appearances.\n\nNone were as memorable as his first run, however, as Ryan took Cleveland all the way to the championship game, where he threw three touchdowns in a 27-0 shutout win over Baltimore.\n\nRyan, who earned his doctorate while playing football, is fifth all-time in franchise history with 13,361 passing yards and third in touchdowns.\n\nTo this day, the Cleveland Browns are looking for their first trip to the Super Bowl. While they were a dominant franchise in the early days of the NFL -- as well as the short existence of the AAFC -- they haven't been in the title game during the Super Bowl era.\n\nThat nearly changed in 1980.\n\nThe Browns boasted one of the best teams in the NFL -- and the most resilient. Nicknamed the Kardiac Kids, the Browns defense was lights out, and their offense had a knack for pulling off game-winning drives under quarterback Brian Sipe (they orchestrated 11 in 1979 and 1980).\n\nSipe guided them to the playoffs following the 1980 season after winning the NFL MVP Award on the heels of a 4,132-yard, 30-touchdown campaign. They were on their way to another victory, but disaster happened in the playoffs. Facing the Oakland Raiders, Sipe and the Browns trailed 14-12 with 49 seconds remaining. Looking for a touchdown, they called the infamous \"Red Right 88\" play, which was supposed to be thrown out of the end zone if no one was open.\n\nThat's not what happened as Sipe threw an ill-advised ball that was intercepted by Mike Davis to seal the game. Oakland went on to win it all, but it's hard not to think the Browns couldn't have done so if they had kept the ball and kicked the field goal.\n\nWhile Sipe is often remembered for this moment, he should get more credit for the work he did on the field. He remains first in franchise history with 23,713 yards and second with 154 touchdowns.\n\nThe hometown kid who became the face of the franchise, Bernie Kosar was born in Youngstown, Ohio, and made no secret of his desire to play for the Browns. He even found an interesting way to make that happen.\n\nIn 1985, the NFL wouldn't allow underclassmen to enter the NFL Draft, so Kosar got his degree after the season ended but didn't declare for the draft. The Minnesota Vikings had moved up to the No. 1 spot in order to land Kosar, but he ended up in the supplemental draft instead.\n\nCleveland traded its first- and third-round picks in 1985 and its first and sixth in 1986 to the Buffalo Bills in order to get the top pick in that supplemental draft, and Kosar wound up being the most popular selection in the oft-forgotten process.\n\nHis desire to play in Cleveland helped him become the most popular player in recent memory. He spent nine seasons at the helm, leading the Browns to a record of 53-51-1 with four playoff appearances. Kosar was 3-4 in the postseason, and while he never led them to a title, they had a shot whenever he was under center.\n\nKosar was uncerimoniously released by Bill Belichik in 1993 in favor of Vinny Testaverde. It was disheartening to see him leave, but he did at least get a Super Bowl ring with the Dallas Cowboys as their backup quarterback. As for his time in Cleveland, he's third in the record books with 21,904 yards passing and fourth with 116 touchdowns.\n\nIt's impossible to debate who belongs at No. 1 in any Cleveland Browns quarterback ranking. The legendary Graham was the first superstar this organization ever had. Originally selected by the Detroit Lions in the 1944 NFL Draft, the Northwestern product spent two years in the Coast Guard before returning to football, where he signed with Cleveland.\n\nHe was late to arrive to camp once the Coast Guard discharged him, which left him behind Cliff Lewis on the depth chart. Graham was sprinkled into the offense, and after a few games, they were unable to keep him off the field.\n\nHe started nine games as a rookie and led the league with 17 touchdown passes while throwing just five picks. A league dominated by the run wasn't ready to defend Graham, who continued to air it out. He was the yardage leader in his second season, an honor he held onto from 1947 through 1949 in the AAFC. He was also a four-time AAFC MVP and led his team to the title four years in a row.\n\nWhen Cleveland moved to the NFL, Graham continued to dominate. He won the NFL MVP three times (1951, 1953, and 1955) and led the squad to three titles (195, 1954, and 1955). None meant as much as the 1950 win, however, since it flew in the face of the narrative the Browns didn't belong in the NFL.\n\nGraham retired following that year and left with an impressive resume. He lost just 13 games in 71 appearances in the NFL and never missed the playoffs, where he was 10-3. He made the All-Pro First-Team eight times and had seven championships and five MVPs between the two leagues. A statue of Graham cam be found in front of Cleveland Browns Stadium, reminding us all how great he was.", "source": {"uri": "dawgpounddaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawg Pound Daily"},

Because so many of the team's best and most experienced players were mostly absent from the optional (and instruction-based) practices for various reasons, it was hard to gauge much in terms of positional progress or potential roster sleepers.\n\nEven in a controlled environment, there was football. And there will be more competitive football starting in late July when the Browns reconvene for training camp. It would be difficult and disingenuous to give a projection on the team's initial 53-man roster based on the six open practices in May and June. But what follows is a mix of observations, educated guesses and potentially crowded roadways on the path to Cleveland navigating training camp and three preseason games before trimming its roster.\n\nThis is going to be a hard roster to make. The Browns basically return the entire top of the roster from last year's 11-win team, plus a bunch of players in the middle and lower tiers who were pressed into action last season by various injuries. The defensive tackle and cornerback groups are especially deep. There's a rare case of having six offensive line starters (plus top backups at guard and tackle) who will likely return, and the running back group has returnees and new players who have significant experience.\n\nThe offseason closed with the roster at the capacity of 91, and with practice squad sizes still at 16, most players who make it to camp will be around in some capacity -- and at least on the fringe of the team's plans. But the race for the 53 protected spots in late August will be an interesting one with the team in win-now mode and new kickoff rules potentially affecting the thinking at the bottom of the roster.\n\nThe Browns will probably create a rotation of potential game-day call-ups from the practice squad with young linebackers and safeties for special teams purposes. But with no clear answer on whether star running back Nick Chubb will be ready for the start of the season and potential third-down back and kickoff returner Nyheim Hines also recovering from a torn ACL, you can't go too far down the list of perceived roster locks before encountering some uncertainty.\n\nPierre Strong Jr. is going to make the team. He might be the fifth running back, and he might not play running back at all. In May and June, we saw Strong's impressive straight-line speed, and that's probably enough. That speed is a major reason the Browns traded for him last August, and it showed up with Strong playing as a punt gunner early last season before getting reps as a kickoff returner and part-time running back.\n\nBefore we get into sorting through a running back rotation that probably starts with Chubb and Jerome Ford and also includes Hines and D'Onta Foreman in some capacity, I'm guessing Strong is going to be on the game-day active roster. Just based on spring observations, Strong and newly signed backup cornerback Justin Hardee Sr. are near the top of the list of players in line to make the roster for special teams reasons.\n\nThe two locks at quarterback are obvious: Deshaun Watson and Jameis Winston. From there, it's hard to say where things go -- or even if the Browns are certain to keep a third quarterback on the active roster assuming the top two are fully healthy. For most of the spring, Winston was up first in seven-on-seven and Tyler Huntley was second. In minicamp, Watson progressed to seven-on-seven participation and Dorian Thompson-Robinson was also throwing. The Browns got Huntley on a minimum contract in late March, and the team mostly liked what it saw from Thompson-Robinson before a late November injury ended his rookie season.\n\nMaybe either Huntley or Thompson-Robinson ends up getting traded to help Cleveland address something at the back of the roster. Maybe Huntley makes it and serves as the designated quarterback sneak runner. Maybe Thompson-Robinson will have an impressive summer and becomes the inexpensive, long-term backup option the team hoped he could be. Regardless of when Watson is fully cleared, Huntley and Thompson-Robinson figure to get plenty of August chances to audition for Cleveland first, but also the rest of the league.\n\nIt would probably be fair to say the Browns learned from last year's wild and ever-changing quarterback situation that depth should be built and protected, and that should be taken into account in any quarterback and roster projection. But the reality is Watson either plays something close to a full season at a high level or the team isn't reaching its goals.\n\nAssuming health, the thinnest spots on the current roster are probably linebacker and tight end. Add the injury situations, and running back and offensive tackle seem to also be areas that could end up seeing some shuffling or additions at the bottom. Unless there's a veteran addition the Browns have long been discussing, any moves between now and the start of camp would probably be made for practice purposes and ensuring the team has enough healthy players at every position group for the training camp grind.\n\nEspecially on a top-heavy roster like this one, availability will drive any early-camp decisions on the roster. At linebacker, there's room for young players to make the team behind Jordan Hicks and Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah. David Njoku is firmly the top tight end, and top backup Jordan Akins is 32, so that's a spot that could see a summer addition.\n\nIt's hard to know what to make of the receiving group with Amari Cooper away from the team in June, Jerry Jeudy only spotted at one spring practice and a group of players who have little experience with the team such as Michael Woods II, James Proche II and Jaelon Darden. Another name to watch headed to August is Matt Landers, who's been bouncing around practice squads but made an impression in spring practices with the Browns after being signed in mid-May.\n\nIt's my belief that the Browns plan to open the season with Jeudy in the slot and Cooper and Cedric Tillman out wide. Jeudy can play outside, too, and Elijah Moore will also see snaps inside and outside. David Bell probably is the No. 5 wide receiver, and anyone else wanting to get in the immediate mix would need a combination of a big summer and special teams ability.\n\nThe good news for players in what's now the second and third tier of the receiver group is they'll get plenty of summer chances, even if Cooper and Jeudy are involved for all of training camp. Jeudy's spring injury is believed to be minor. The Browns have 12 receivers on their current roster, a pretty standard number for training camp. Woods is back after missing all of 2023 with a torn Achilles tendon, and rookie Jamari Thrash will also try to push for a roster spot.\n\nThe Browns brought back safety Rodney McLeod Jr. (34 this month), guard Michael Dunn (30 in August) and defensive tackles Shelby Harris (33 in August) and Maurice Hurst II (29) on one-year deals. They also signed 31-year-old defensive tackle Quinton Jefferson to a one-year deal and retained Za'Darius Smith (32 in September) on a two-year deal. Those players are in the plans to varying extents, and it's too early to know if age will be a factor should the Browns end up facing complicated roster decisions in late August.\n\nSome younger players have to be involved, which is why it's fair to guess some of the eventual decisions will at least be somewhat complicated. The Browns have made nine third-day draft picks over the last two years. Offensive tackle Dawand Jones is obviously in the plans, and so is cornerback Cameron Mitchell. Second-year defensive end Isaiah McGuire should make the team as the fifth pass rusher, but neither McGuire nor 2023 third-round defensive tackle Siaki Ika played much as rookies. Luke Wypler will compete with Dunn, Brian Allen and potentially Germain Ifedi for a backup interior offensive line job.\n\nFrom this year's draft class, defensive tackle Mike Hall Jr. and guard Zak Zinter are obvious roster locks. Sixth-round linebacker Nathaniel Watson seems slated for special teams duty and a roster spot, but nothing seems guaranteed for Thrash, seventh-round cornerback Myles Harden or seventh-round defensive tackle Jowon Briggs. The Browns value their depth at cornerback and across the defensive line and should be commended for building it, but difficult decisions must be made later this summer.\n\nLast year, linebacker Mohamoud Diabate and safety Ronnie Hickman made the initial roster as undrafted rookies. Hickman looks like a keeper, while Diabate again could make the team as a special teams player. In the spring, we only got a quick glance at the new kickoff rules, and with no contact allowed, it was basically just instructional. Keep an eye on the preseason games and the Browns' mid-August joint practices with the Minnesota Vikings for a better gauge of which young players might be earning special teams roles and which have a shot to follow Hickman and Diabate as potential long-shot success stories.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

While we may have a month to wait, there is much to stew on from the announcement of in-season \"Hard Knocks,\" to the inevitable return of running back Nick Chubb, and more.\n\nOne piece to stew on is ESPN's new article where they graded every team's offseason. And for the Cleveland Browns, they gave them pretty high marks! While the Browns spent most of their energy re-signing their own standout players from a year ago, there were some upgrades made to the roster.\n\nThis was capped off with the 2024 NFL draft, where Ohio State defensive tackle Michael Hall Jr. and guard Zak Zinter headlined their haul of rookies. The extensions of general manager Andrew Berry and head coach Kevin Stefanski put a bow on their offseason.\n\nSo what did ESPN's Seth Walder have to say about the offseason that Cleveland put together? Find out here!\n\n[affiliatewidget_smgtolocal] ESPN's identified biggest move: Trade for and extension of WR Jerry Jeudy\n\nBrowns wide receivers Elijah Moore (8) and Jerry Jeudy (3) share a laugh with a coach during minicamp, Wednesday, June 12, 2024, in Berea.\n\nFirst off, Walder named the Browns' biggest move this offseason as their trade for former first round receiver Jerry Jeudy (and his subsequent extension). Here is what Walder had to say on the move:\n\n\"Though Jeudy has not lived up to his pre-draft promise, he still offers upside beyond the production he has shown. In 2021 and 2022, he recorded open scores of 79 and 80, indicating route-running ability that could unlock a higher level of play, especially for someone entering his age-25 season. And it's not like the Browns are giving him superstar compensation: His $17.5 million APY lags far behind the price of stars.\"\n\nESPN's most liked move: Trading for WR Jerry Jeudy\n\nDec 11, 2022; Denver, Colorado, USA; Denver Broncos wide receiver Jerry Jeudy (10) reacts to his third touchdown reception of the game in the fourth quarter against the Kansas City Chiefs at Empower Field at Mile High. Mandatory Credit: Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWalder continued to heap praise upon Jeudy, stating how he thinks we may \"look back on this trade and contract as a bargain for Cleveland...\" Ending his sermon on Jeudy, Walder adds:\n\n\"I think it's a great bet for a team that needed another receiver, especially one with Jeudy's upside.\"\n\nESPN's most disliked move: Not trading for QB Justin Fields\n\nPITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA - JUNE 6: Justin Fields #2 of the Pittsburgh Steelers throws a pass during the Pittsburgh Steelers OTA offseason workout at UPMC Rooney Sports Complex on June 6 2024 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Joe Sargent/Getty Images)\n\nWalder went on to add his most disliked move for the Browns, and it was that they did not give up the Day 3 compensation it took to acquire quarterback Justin Fields from the Chicago Bears. The Browns, of course, opted to let Joe Flacco walk this offseason, signing Jameis Winston instead. Here are Walder's thoughts:\n\n\"While the Browns are heavily invested in Deshaun Watson, he has played poorly enough in Cleveland that the team ought to look at alternatives rather than run out the clock on a talented roster. Not trading for Fields, who was eventually dealt for a conditional sixth-round pick, was a misstep, in my view.\"\n\nOther notes mentioned: The Za'Darius Smith extension\n\nNov 5, 2023; Cleveland, Ohio, USA; Cleveland Browns defensive end Za'Darius Smith (99) sacks Arizona Cardinals quarterback Clayton Tune (15) during the fourth quarter at Cleveland Browns Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Scott Galvin-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe ESPN analyst then went on to single out the move to extend defensive end Za'Darius Smith to a two-year deal as well:\n\n\"The Browns also re-signed defensive end Za'Darius Smith after a season when he recorded only 5.5 sacks but, according to advanced metrics, still disrupted the quarterback, as his 21% pass rush win rate ranked 12th among all qualifiers.\"\n\nIt sure sounds like Walder is a fan of that move as well.\n\nFinal thoughts on Walder's grading of the Browns' offseason\n\nAug 26, 2023; Kansas City, Missouri, USA; A general view of a Cleveland Browns helmet during the second half against the Kansas City Chiefs at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAll in all, Walder gave the Browns a B+ for their offseason moves. Again, most of their energy was focused on retaining their own free agents with additions like the trade for Jeudy sprinkled in. It is worth mentioning that Walder is an analytics guy at ESPN as well, so it makes sense that he would value the separation and yards after the catch metrics shown from Jeudy (he's one of the best in those categories) as well as pressure data put on tape from Smith.\n\nA B+ is probably a bit gracious from Walder, but the Browns do not deserve lower than a B- for their offseason either. It is worth mentioning that the Browns were given the highest grade of any AFC North team in Walder's piece.", "source": {"uri": "brownswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Browns Wire"},

Even with three of the four starting quarterbacks dealing with injuries, the division had the highest combined win-loss percentage (.632) in the league. Joe Burrow and Deshaun Watson appear to be on track or even ahead of schedule for a Week 1 return, and the Steelers brought in Russell Wilson as the presumed starter to keep up with the competition.\n\nThe best division in football figures to be even better this upcoming season.\n\nFormer NFL scouts Daniel Jeremiah and Bucky Brooks gave their quarterback rankings for each division in football and they had slightly different views when it comes to the AFC North.\n\nBrooks:\n\n1. Joe Burrow\n\n2. Lamar Jackson\n\n3. Russell Wilson\n\n4. Deshaun Watson\n\nJeremiah:\n\n1. Lamar Jackson\n\n2. Joe Burrow\n\n3. Russell Wilson\n\n4. Deshaun Watson\n\nEither way you slice it, Burrow and Jackson are in a tier of their own at the top of the division. When healthy and at the top of his game, Burrow has proven he can be among the league's best, and Jackson now has two MVP trophies under his belt as one of the most dynamic players in the league. But what is interesting is that they both agreed on Wilson being ranked ahead of Watson.\n\n\"I don't know if I had on the bingo card that you and I would both rank Russell Wilson over Deshaun Watson,\" Brooks said on the latest episode of Move The Sticks. \"It just kinda shows how far, I would say, the shine has come off Deshaun Watson. But then, when you look at the numbers, he's played 12 games for the Browns. He's completed less than 60 percent of his passes. And at 14:9 touchdown interception ratio, that's significant. I just find it surprising that we have maybe the top-paid quarterback, Deshaun Watson, at the bottom of the list.\"\n\nEven with Wilson coming off two of the worst seasons of his career, they have reached the same conclusion about him being placed over Watson. The argument has less to do with what they think of Wilson's potential and more to do with how down they are on Watson.\n\nThe last time that Watson played a full season was in 2020 for the Houston Texans. He threw for 4,823 yards with a 70.2 completion percentage and 33 touchdown passes. Coincidentally, that was also Wilson's last stellar season. With the Seattle Seahawks, he threw for 4,212 yards with a 68.8 completion percentage and 40 touchdown passes.\n\nWilson is seven years older than Watson, but given the recent track record -- even with Wilson's struggles -- he has outperformed Watson. Both quarterbacks will be looking for a bounce-back season in 2024. Which has a better chance of realizing that goal?\n\n\"I just feel more confident that if Russell Wilson at his peak was an A, I feel more confident that Russell Wilson can get back to being a B, B-plus player,\" Jeremiah said. \"Whereas I'm not as confident that Deshaun Watson can get anywhere close to his A game. He doesn't resemble himself.\"\n\nWhere would you rank the AFC North quarterbacks?\n\nRelated Items:AFC North, Bucky Brooks, Daniel Jeremiah, Deshaun Watson, Move The Sticks, Russell Wilson\n\nRecommended for you\n\nAnalyst Claims Steelers Signed Russell Wilson Because They Were In 'Crisis Mode' At Quarterback\n\nESPN's Seth Walder Picks Steelers Last In AFC North, Questions Roster Overcoming Average QB Play\n\nDeshaun Watson Making 'Heat-Seeking' Throws During Spring Practices", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ross_mccorkle@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Ross McCorkle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_Brooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bucky Brooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Jeremiah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Jeremiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/StockRussellWilson20.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660084", "eventUri": "eng-9660084", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

And I think he got better in the weight room, got better in the meeting room, definitely got better on the grass.\"\n\nThe Browns went through much of the offseason workout program without their top two projected wide receivers. Amari Cooper was away from the facility amid an apparent contract dispute and Jerry Jeudy didn't participate in minicamp because of a minor injury. But coaches have been impressed with the team's depth at the position, which could make it a position of strength in 2024.\n\n\"I just feel like it's going to be a lot more explosive,\" wide receiver Elijah Moore said.\n\nCleveland has made multiple moves over the past few years to add talent at wideout. Before the 2022 season, the team traded a fifth-round pick to the Dallas Cowboys and swapped sixth-rounders for Cooper. Last offseason, the team traded a second-round pick to the New York Jets for Moore and a third-rounder. And in March, the Browns sent fifth- and sixth-round picks to the Denver Broncos for Jeudy; Cleveland later signed Jeudy to a three-year extension.\n\nEven with limited draft capital because of the Watson trade, the Browns have used early picks on wide receivers, selecting Tillman in the third round of the 2023 draft and David Bell in the third round of the 2022 draft.\n\nWith a revamped offense installing drop-back concepts from new coordinator Ken Dorsey, the Browns are expected to introduce more spread looks, which would mean more opportunities for their wide receivers. The Cooper-Jeudy tandem wasn't on the practice field in the spring, but the team was pleased with the progress of its unheralded pass-catchers.\n\nStefanski and wide receivers coach Chad O'Shea praised the growth of Tillman, who caught 21 passes as a rookie. Sixth-round pick Jamari Thrash frequently got open in team drills and O'Shea said Thrash has picked up the playbook quickly after lining up at one spot at Louisville.\n\nMoore, who caught a career-high 59 passes in 2023, said he's more comfortable in Year 2 with the Browns, and the team plans to keep on leaning into his versatility.\n\nThe Browns place a premium on separation, a skill that was appealing to them when they made the trade for Jeudy. While Jeudy, a 2020 first-round pick, hasn't eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards in a season, he finished top-12 in ESPN's open score metric in 2021 and 2022. The open score metric assesses the likelihood a receiver would be able to complete a catch if he were targeted. Moore finished 37th among 153 qualifying wide receivers and tight ends in 2023.\n\nCreating separation will be necessary in an offense that will feature more choice routes, a concept in which receivers can break in multiple directions depending on the leverage of defenders.\n\nTiming is key for the choice routes to be successful, however. While Watson didn't get a ton of reps with Cooper and Jeudy, he believes they have enough time to get on the same page in training camp.\n\n\"It takes reps, it takes them talking about it, it takes watching film,\" Dorsey said. \"There's so many different aspects of not only those routes, but a lot of different routes within the system. ... There's a lot of communication there. When we had Cole [Beasley] in Buffalo, there was an adjustment period there, and getting on the same page like that first year was like, 'Oh, is this going to work?' Because it just takes time for quarterback and receiver to get on the same page on some of those field routes.\"\n\nCooper's situation still lingers over the team, however, with a month until players report back to begin preparations for the 2024 season. He's entering the final year of his contract while many of his peers, including Jeudy, have received new deals. Cooper, who turned 30 on Monday, recorded a career-high 1,250 yards in 2023 and remains the team's undisputed WR1. Watson called him \"the best in the game\" during minicamp.\n\nGeneral manager Andrew Berry, speaking during an appearance on NFL Network's \"The Insiders\" on Monday, declined to comment specifically on Cooper's contract status but affirmed him as an integral part of the team's plans.\n\n\"Sometimes all teams will have periods where they go through these types of situations,\" Berry said. \"But it doesn't change our affinity for Amari. We'll navigate, call it, the business considerations and the business aspects as it goes. But he is a big part of our team. And just as importantly, he's a big part of our culture.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jeudy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jeudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stefanski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stefanski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amari Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berea,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bell_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Bell (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Dorsey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ken Dorsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_O'Shea", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chad O'Shea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Berry_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Berry (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Cooperatives", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0619%2Fr1347865_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660084", "eventUri": "eng-9660084", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

He was the 2023 AP SEC Defensive Player of the Year winner and All-SEC first-team selection as well as a finalist for The Butkus Award, given to college football's best linebacker. He led the SEC with 137 tackles and 10 sacks.\n\nAt 6-foot-2, 233 pounds, he played six total seasons at Mississippi State and turns 24 on Sept. 1.\n\n\"He's played a lot of football,\" Tarver said last week. \"He's experienced, so he sees things pretty well for a rookie, but like you said, a slightly older rookie in the NFL. So, we like where he's going. I'm excited to see him in pads. Yeah, I want to see him in pads. \"\n\nThat's a high compliment for any rookie to get this early in their first year.\n\nBut you definitely saw Watson's football acumen throughout the spring. He certainly passed the eyeball test, and never looked lost or out of place throughout OTAs or minicamp when the veterans arrived.\n\nHe also made plays.\n\nDuring the first week of OTAs, Watson ended the second day of practice when he picked off a Tyler Huntley pass intended for running back Jerome Ford, and ran it back the length of the field. He was mobbed by his teammates after the play, and they posed for a photo.\n\nNot only did Watson obviously benefit from having played a lot of college football, he's proven to be extremely coachable for one reason in particular.\n\n\"He's very experienced, and what Nathaniel does a really good job of is not making the same mistake,\" Tarver said. \"And if you're a rookie and you can learn from your mistakes and not make the same mistake twice, he got better and better and better. Like, he had a play today that was the same as one yesterday, and he corrected it.\n\n\"So, if he keeps going on that's what rookies need to do is don't be the guy that's making mistakes over and over, be the guy that's fixing things.\"\n\nAfter spring Watson seems to be thoroughly in the mix in a linebacker room that also include Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah, who's coming off his best year yet, Jordan Hicks, Devin Bush, Tony Fields II and Mohamoud Diabate.\n\nNo matter how the linebacker depth chart turns out in the fall, though, Watson seems in perfect position to make an impact with the NFL's new kickoff rules, even though he didn't have a ton of special teams experience in college.\n\nThe new rules will have 10 members of the kicking team lining up on the receiving team's 40-yard line and a minimum of nine members of the receiving team lining up between the 30 and 35-yard line. The play doesn't begin until the ball is either caught or hits the ground in the landing zone between the 20 and the goal line -- and any ball that lands in the landing zone has to be returned.\n\nWhile the Browns have been working and drilling the new rules in the spring, the fact remains that no one really knows just what the new kickoff will look like yet -- not until we at least get some preseason games in the books.\n\n\"I don't know how it works either, but I know we're close together so that means it's just a better impact,\" Watson said during rookie minicamp in May. \"Like I said, I'm a physical person, I just love hitting somebody, so I mean I just can't wait to get out there on special teams.\"\n\nBased on his performance in the spring, he seems poised to show off that physicality wherever the Browns need him.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Owusu-Koramoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference_football_individual_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference football individual awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butkus_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butkus Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_State_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi State Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berea,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Ford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Ford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Huntley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Huntley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Fields_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Fields II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Bush_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Bush Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickoff_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kickoff (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/W7RLQQ7VM5BK3CFCPMSW6BXJ3Y.JPG?auth=116dfa336952098ce3f6613d8dbba74803c1471a6385a07f26bcda4a769c4a22&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660084", "eventUri": "eng-9660084", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-01", "textStart": 923, "textEnd": 930}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

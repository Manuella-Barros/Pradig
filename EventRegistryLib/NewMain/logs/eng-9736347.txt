Warns of Potential Slowdown Amidst Password Sharing Crackdown ~ My Mobile India", "body": "Advertising business grows 34% but not a primary revenue driver until 2026\n\nNetflix reported a better-than-expected addition of over 8 million subscribers in its second quarter, surpassing analyst predictions of 5 million.\n\nThe streaming giant attributed this growth to its password-sharing crackdown and popular titles like \"Bridgerton\" and \"The Roast of Tom Brady\".\n\nThe company's diluted per-share earnings reached $4.88, exceeding consensus forecasts of $4.74.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was in line with estimates at $9.56 billion.\n\nNetflix's total global subscribers now exceed 277 million.\n\nDespite the positive results, Netflix issued a cautious guidance for the third quarter.\n\nThe company expects subscriber gains to be lower than the same period in 2023 when it had just initiated its password-sharing restrictions.\n\n\"Netflix is still the best and most profitable streaming company out there, but with technology stocks generally retreating over the last several days, some investors may sell on the generally good news and taking profits now while waiting for a possible better re-entry point for the stock,\" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital.\n\nNetflix's advertising business grew 34% from the previous quarter.\n\nHowever, the company stated that advertising would not be a primary driver of revenue growth until at least 2026.\n\nThis cautious stance on advertising growth led to the departure of Peter Naylor, the vice president of ad sales.\n\nThird Bridge analyst Jamie Lumley said Netflix's advertising business \"has yet to prove itself from a revenue standpoint.\" Lumley also noted, \"Our experts highlight that Amazon has made a much bigger splash in the ad market and that Netflix needs to continue working on scale in this segment if it wants to be a major player.\"\n\n\"By combining its ad-supported model with live sports streaming, Netflix not only attracts a dedicated viewer base but also creates new monetization opportunities through dynamic ad placements and exclusive content,\" says Sabya Das, president and chief operating officer at AI video company Magnifi. \"This dual approach underscores Netflix's ability to turn what I would have deemed a survival strategy to retain subscribers into a massive growth opportunity, solidifying itself as an entertainment hub and paving the way for innovation in personalized advertising and user experience.\"\n\nNetflix shares initially dipped but later rose 1% in after-hours trading.\n\nThe stock has seen a nearly one-third increase so far this year.\n\nHowever, some analysts suggest investors might sell on the good news, waiting for a better re-entry point amidst a general retreat in technology stocks.\n\nAs Netflix faces market saturation in the US, it plans to stop regularly reporting new subscriber additions next year.\n\nThe company's focus appears to be shifting towards its advertising business and gaming initiatives as potential sources of future growth.\n\nNetflix's foray into live sports, marked by a significant 10-year $5 billion deal with WWE Raw and a three-year agreement to stream NFL games on Christmas Day, is expected to enhance its revenue by attracting more advertisers.\n\nThe company's strategic combination of ad-supported models with live sports streaming is anticipated to create new monetization opportunities through dynamic ad placements.\n\nThis move, alongside the success of live events like \"The Roast of Tom Brady,\" positions Netflix to leverage its growing ads business for substantial revenue growth.\n\nIn response to strong Q2 growth, Netflix has revised its annual revenue growth forecast to 14%-15% and expects an operating margin of 26%.\n\nMoving forward, the company plans to focus on revenue and operating margin as primary financial metrics, shifting from its previous emphasis on subscriber numbers and average revenue per user.\n\nBeyond its ads business, Netflix is enhancing its original content and gaming offerings.\n\nStarting this month, the company will release a new game each month, many based on popular Netflix titles like \"Selling Sunset\" and \"Squid Game.\"\n\nAdditionally, Netflix is revamping its home screen interface with a 'My Netflix' section to highlight recently watched or saved content.\n\nDespite a slight dip in stock prices, Netflix remains well-positioned for continued success as it adapts to the changing media landscape.\n\nNetflix added over 8 million new subscribers in the second quarter, surpassing analyst expectations of 5 million.\n\nNetflix reported diluted per-share earnings of $4.88, exceeding the consensus forecast of $4.74.\n\nNetflix has issued a cautious guidance for the third quarter, expecting subscriber gains to be lower than the same period in 2023.\n\nNetflix's advertising business grew 34% from the previous quarter, but it is not expected to be a primary revenue driver until at least 2026.\n\nNetflix plans to release a multiplayer game based on \"Squid Game\" later this year, along with developing games tied to \"Emily in Paris\" and \"Selling Sunset.\"\n\nAlso Read: How Does Netflix Gaming Work?", "source": {"uri":

It initially leaned on Microsoft to build the backbone of the ad tier.\n\n\"Despite this progress, we continue to view advertising as a longer term story and do not expect a material revenue contribution until 2025,\" BofA Global Research analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said in a note on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@indianexpress.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfinity", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xfinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Product bundling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey's_Anatomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grey's Anatomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCIS (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Broadcasting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Broadcasting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free_Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free Classifieds", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Netflix-Reuters-File-photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 1290, "textEnd": 1297}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The streaming giant had already stopped accepting new customers for the Basic plan, which costs $11.99 per month, last October. But existing Basic plan subscribers were still able to continue with their current plan.\n\nBut now Netflix has said it is fully retiring the tier - and existing customers, in the tens of millions, will have to move over to another plan. Basic plan users seeking an ad-free experience on Netflix will now have two options: the Standard plan at $15.49 per month or the Premium plan that has 4K at $22.99 per month.

If Netflix follows that time scale for the US, customers in America will get warnings later this year or early next year. Customers have reacted to the axing of the Basic plan on social media.\n\nOn Reddit, one user wrote: 'They're taking away the plan that most people have had for years and forcing them into a higher tier. 'That's a great plan to force people back out to the high seas!' Meanwhile, later on Thursday, Netflix said it added more than 8 million subscribers in its second quarter - from April to June.\n\nThe streaming service benefited from a password-sharing crackdown and such titles as ' Bridgerton ,' 'Baby Reindeer' and 'The Roast of Tom Brady .' While the subscriber gains topped analyst predictions of 5 million, Netflix also cautioned that third-quarter subscriber gains would be lower than the comparable period in 2023 when the password-sharing crackdown had just started.\n\nNetflix also said its vice president of ad sales, Peter Naylor, was leaving the company. In a letter to investors, the company said it did not expect advertising to be a primary driver of revenue growth until at least 2026.\n\nNetflix shares fell 2 percent in after-hours trading to $630.06. At the end of June, the new sign-ups brought the total number of global Netflix subscribers to more than 277 million. The streaming video pioneer is facing saturation in the United States and told Wall Street last quarter that it plans to stop regularly reporting new subscriber additions next year.\n\nInvestors have been monitoring the growth of Netflix's ad-supported tier, which has been fueled by the company's crackdown on password-sharing, pricing increases for ad-free tiers and new consumer bundles, such as Comcast's 'StreamSaver' bundle, which combines Netflix with Peacock and Apple TV+.\n\nNetflix said its ad tier membership grew 34 percent from the prior quarter, but it did not say how many subscribers chose that option. 'Our ad business is growing nicely and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to our business,' Netflix said in its letter to investors. 'But building a business from scratch takes time - and coupled with the large size of our subscription revenue - we don't expect advertising to be a primary driver of our revenue growth in 2024 or 2025.' The company said it expects third-quarter revenue growth of 14%, compared with a year ago.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Netflix basic subscribers had to pay $1 more a month - up from $7.99 to $8.99. The standard and premium subscription plans went up $2 - to $12.99 and $15.99, respectively.\n\nIn October 2023, as well as axing its $9.99 basic plan, Netflix also increased its premium ad-free plan, which allows users to add two extra members from different households - from $19.99 to $22.99 a month.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Business_Plans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Business Plans", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic Management", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement Planning", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Netflix-has-a-plan-to-get-you.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-10-", "textStart": 3570, "textEnd": 3582}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-", "textStart": 3712, "textEnd": 3720}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Netflix has beaten analysts' revenue estimates in three of the past five quarters and five of the past 10 quarters.\n\nAnalysts expect Netflix to report second-quarter earnings per share of $4.74, compared to $3.29 in last year's second quarter. The company has beaten earnings per share estimates in four of the past five quarters and eight of the past 10 quarters.\n\nGuidance from Netflix calls for second-quarter revenue to be $9.49 billion and earnings per share to be $4.68.\n\nRead Also: Netflix Buys International Rights To Tencent's Chinese Series 'See Her Again': Why This Rare Move Matters\n\nWhat Analysts Are Saying: Expectations for Netflix could be too high in the second quarter, Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett said in a new investor note.\n\nThe analyst said the outlook of second-quarter member growth is lower than that of the first quarter, which is reasonable given normal seasonality.\n\n\"We don't see a basis for the more bullish calls that Netflix can substantially top its member growth outlook,\" Crockett said.\n\nThe analyst, who had a Neutral rating and $554 price target, said membership growth is the key to Netflix stock reaction to earnings reports.\n\nCrockett said usage data from the company and Google searches show a decline in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. The analyst said the second and third quarters are seasonally the slowest for subscriber growth.\n\n\"While Netflix is a well-managed company, the transition from growth to a more mature trajectory could weigh on share performance.\"\n\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth also recently said expectations were high for Netflix's second quarter. The analyst, who had an Overweight rating, raised the price target from $650 to $750.\n\n\"We remain positive on Netflix shares heading in Q2 earnings on Thursday, 7/18, while also recognizing high expectations,\" Anmuth said.\n\nThe analyst said positive trends for Netflix include paid sharing growth, core subscriber growth, strong content and the ad-supported tier growth. Additionally, sports content could boost engagement for Netflix, the analyst said.\n\n\"We expect a bigger push into live sports over time, particularly as leverage continues to shift in NFLX's direction.\"\n\nThe ad-supported plan is the key for Netflix to scale subscribers going forward, Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan said.\n\nThe analyst, who had a Sell rating, raised the price target from $450 to $545.\n\n\"Netflix management undeniably continues to execute well on paid sharing, its AVOD effort and injecting significant new content including NFL Christmas Day games and WWE Raw next year,\" Harrigan said.\n\nWhile Harrigan praised the company's growth and operations, valuation of the stock looks stretched.\n\n\"We still do not feel the current valuation can be justified even valuing Netflix as a Nasdaq 100 high growth technology name and disregarding its hybrid media stock character.\"\n\nHere's a look at other analyst ratings on Netflix and their price targets:\n\nKey Items to Watch: Netflix added 9.33 million paid subscribers in the first quarter to end the quarter with 269.6 million.\n\nThe company did not provide guidance for subscribers only saying it expected the second quarter add to be lower than the first quarter. Netflix also said it won't provide subscriber metrics in 2025. The headline subscriber number will likely be a key for investors and analysts.\n\nThe upcoming content slate from Netflix will also be another hot topic with a second season of the massive hit \"Squid Game\" expected in the second half of 2024 with no release date.\n\nOther sports content will also fill the second half of the year like a Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing match, a Joey Chestnut hot dog eating contest and two NFL games on Christmas Day.\n\nNetflix could share an update on more sports content or how the advertising demand for these key events is shaping up in relation to the ad-supported plan.\n\nThe streaming company could also share other upcoming shows and movies to get fans and investors excited.\n\nNFLX Price Action: Netflix shares trade at $642.71 Wednesday at publication versus a 52-week trading range of $344.73 to $697.49.

If it's also time for them to chill, only time will tell! Much of that will depend on the financial and subscriber trends the global streaming giant reports after the stock market closes on July 18.\n\nNetflix shares have been on a roll this year. They are up around 12 percent since the firm's first-quarter earnings report in mid-April and up 41 percent for the year to date, compared with a 17 percent gain for the broad-based S&P 500 stock index.\n\nBut Netflix management previously guided that its second-quarter subscriber growth will come in below the 9.3 million adds recorded in the first quarter, which had been an upside surprise. It is also likely to discuss the success of the firm's second-quarter content slate, including such series as Ripley, starring Andrew Scott, Eric with Benedict Cumberbatch, and at the end of the quarter, London-set superpowers drama Supacell, along with such films as Scoop and Zack Snyder's Rebel Moon -- Part Two: The Scargiver.\n\nStill, ahead of Thursday's earnings update, several Wall Street analysts have increased their stock price targets, mirroring a trend seen before the company's first-quarter results.\n\nMoffettNathanson analysts Michael Nathanson and Robert Fishman on Monday boosted their Netflix stock price target by $35 to $565 and reiterated their \"neutral\" rating.\n\n\"For the second quarter, we are raising our Netflix global net paid subscriber addition estimate by 500,000 to 5.5 million driven by an improved U.S./Canada subscriber addition estimate of 2.0 million (versus 1.5 million previously),\" the MoffettNathanson analysts explained. \"As a result of our improved 2025 earnings per share estimate ($22.35 versus $22.25 previously) and a higher market multiple, we raise our Netflix price target.\"\n\nNetflix has made \"significant progress in its password-sharing crackdown,\" the report also highlighted, \"with [the] share of users reporting accessing the platform through another household's account dropping from 15 percent when the crackdown began a year ago to just 9 percent this past quarter.\" The analysts argued that \"while there are clearly more accounts to clamp down on, we imagine the lowest-hanging fruit has already been picked.\"\n\nFishman and Nathanson also emphasized the streaming giant's recent momentum in a key area, writing: \"A promising sign for both Netflix's ability to get password-sharers to convert to paid subscribers (and for its ability to drive pricing and generate ad inventory) is the meaningful increase the platform saw in users reporting daily engagement.\"\n\nAnother more bullish forecast than before came from Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich on Monday, who pushed up her stock price target from $700 to $740 while reiterating a \"buy\" rating on Netflix in a report entitled \"Well suited for healthy subscriber growth.\" She noted that \"our bias is toward the upside for our net adds and revenue forecasts of 4.6 million/$9.49 billion. Additionally, we anticipate a significant advertising ramp in '25 and '26.\"\n\nReif Ehrlich suggested that \"long-term drivers [are] still intact,\" writing: \"Netflix shares are up over 16 percent since April 19 (the day after reporting first-quarter earnings), which we believe is driven by: 1) third-party data sources indicating healthy subscriber acquisition trends, 2) greater appreciation for the company's enviable market position within the media ecosystem given their significant scale advantage in streaming while also not needing to protect a secularly declining linear asset, and 3) optimism around the potential in advertising - particularly in light of several announcements for live/sports programming (e.g. NFL on Christmas).\"\n\nConcluded the expert: \"Overall, these dynamics support our bullish thesis for longer-term potential which we expect will be driven by healthy revenue growth, continued margin expansion, and outsized free cash flow growth over the next several years.\"\n\nBenjamin Swinburne, analyst at Morgan Stanley, also elevated his Netflix stock price target on Monday, in his case from $700 to $780 and reiterated his \"overweight\" ratings. The expert also raised his subscriber net add estimate to 7 million in the latest quarter taking his full-year 2024 projection to more than 30 million.\n\n\"Our analysis of Netflix engagement data continues to show it is in a league of its own, specifically the strength of international content and depth of consumption,\" he wrote. \"Strong core execution, paid sharing, and ad tiers that help penetrate more price-sensitive cohorts are contributing to a potential record net adds year in '24.\"\n\nThat said, Swinburne also argued that \"Netflix advertising remains unproven, 18 months-plus in,\" adding: \"It has a lot of work ahead to scale ads. We believe its goal should be to build a better YouTube, not a better CBS.\"\n\nSo why is the Morgan Stanley analyst this bullish? \"For Netflix shares, much is priced in but we remain bullish given the still-large opportunity for growth ahead,\" he explained. \"We are admittedly paying in Netflix [a] multiple for the track record this management team has built over two decades navigating disruption and exploiting opportunities. However, the combination of 1) the still-large opportunity ahead (Netflix has less than 10 percent of TV time even in its more mature markets, 2) the track record of innovation and execution over multiple cycles, and 3) the benefits that accrue from scale, free cash flow generation, and a strong balance sheet which stand in sharp contrast to competitors that are largely\n\nretrenching, keep us 'overweight'.\"\n\nTD Cowen analyst John Blackledge in a July 9 report also raised his full-year 2024 subscriber estimate for Netflix and raised his stock price target from $725 to $775. Reiterating his \"buy\" rating, he predicted second-quarter user net adds of 5.19 million, noting that this was above the 3.72 million Wall Street consensus at the time.\n\n\"We think investors will look for updates around Netflix's burgeoning ad tier, paid sharing efforts, and second-half content slate,\" the analyst highlighted. \"Netflix continues to benefit from paid sharing initiatives, strong underlying biz demand, and burgeoning ad tier.\" With the streamer retiring its basic tier in the U.K. and Canada, Blackledge said that this \"should drive further ad tier momentum.\"\n\nHe also highlighted a TD Cowen survey and its findings. \"We asked our surveyed consumers which platform they use most often to view video content on their TV, and Netflix retained the top spot in the second quarter with 23 percent of respondents, followed by YouTube (15 percent) and basic cable (12 percent),\" Blackledge summarized before concluding: \"We think Netflix's broad catalog across multiple genres creates a durable advantage over time.\"\n\nKeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson was also among the Wall Street experts boosting their Netflix stock price target ahead of Thursday's earnings report. He pushed it from $707 to $735 while maintaining his \"overweight\" rating. His key takeaway: \"Recent price increases by competitors and ongoing low rates of churn support Netflix price increases over coming quarters.\"\n\nJPMorgan analyst Douglas Anmuth also recently raised his stock price target on Netflix from $650 to $750, while sticking to his \"overweight\" rating. He expects the streamer to add 5 million-6 million net subscribers in the second quarter.\n\nThe expert pointed out the positives and the challenges for the streamer's shares heading into the latest results. \"Paid sharing has become a more normal course of business, but still remains impactful,\" he noted. And he highlighted that \"we remain positive\" on them, \"while also recognizing high expectations\" ahead of the earnings update.\n\nHis overall bullish takeaway: \"Netflix's large scale, strong engagement, and diversified content will push Netflix toward becoming the default choice for how users consume TV, film, and other long-form content.\"\n\nAnmuth sees Netflix's recent push into sports and sports-related content continuing over time, predicting: \"We expect a bigger push into live sports over time, particularly as leverage continues to shift in Netflix's direction.\"\n\nOne Wall Street observer who didn't change his Netflix stock price target is Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. Predicting second-quarter global net subscriber growth of 3.8 million, compared to what he cited as the consensus figure of 4.8 million, he continues to rate the stock at \"outperform\" with a $725 price target.\n\n\"The most significant benefit of the ad tier so far is that it limits churn,\" Pachter wrote. \"Netflix is positioning to accelerate ad tier revenue contribution into year-end and 2025 as it improves its advertising solutions and targeting, expands partnerships, and adds more live events.\"\n\nHis conclusion: \"Netflix has reached the right formula with global content creation, balancing costs, and increasing profitability. We believe Netflix will continue to expand profitability and generate increasing free cash flow.\"\n\nAnd Pachter reiterated his previously stated take that Netflix has emerged as the winner of the so-called \"streaming wars.\" Wrote the expert: \"Netflix has managed to establish a virtually insurmountable lead in the streaming wars, and we expect competitors to continue to flail while trying to replicate Netflix's business model.\"\n\nDespite increasing clarity on the impact of Netflix's password-sharing crackdown and ad tier rollout, investors and analysts will keep their eyes and ears open for latest management commentary and guidance on Thursday's earnings call with Netflix top executives on various emerging areas, including future sports plans.\n\nThey will also look for the latest management color on subscriber and ad trends, as well as the planned launch of two \"Netflix Houses\" in 2025 in King of Prussia, Pa., and Dallas, Texas. The immersive experiences will feature merchandise, food and experiential offerings tied to the streamer's hits franchises, including Bridgerton, Stranger Things, and Squid Game.", "source": {"uri":

By Julie Jammot\n\nSan Francisco: Netflix on Thursday said it added eight million new subscribers in the second quarter, as the home of hit shows \"The Crown\" and \"Bridgerton\" posted its latest financial earnings that exceeded analyst expectations.\n\nThe world's leading streaming video service said it ended the April-to-June period with a total of 277.7 million subscribers, as net profit dipped to $2.1 billion, but revenue surged to $9.6 billion.\n\nThe latest numbers rewarded Netflix's moves to boost revenue after a rough patch in 2022.\n\nIn a bid to boost sputtering growth, the company launched an ad-subsidized offering last year around the same time as a crackdown on sharing passwords.\n\nAs part of that effort, Netflix also got rid of its cheapest commercial-free plan in the UK and Canada, with expectations of further expansions.\n\nIn the United States, the company is also beginning to offer some users combined packages with its one-time rivals, making itself available through joint subscriptions with Peacock and Apple TV.\n\nNetflix in May said its ad-supported tier reached 40 million monthly active users across the globe and accounted for 40 percent of all sign-ups in the countries where it was available, up from 23 million in January.\n\nThe company also launched an in-house advertising platform so that brands can better optimize its customer data, no longer partnering with Microsoft for that technology.\n\nInvestors have cheered on the moves, with Netflix shares gaining 38 percent since the beginning of the year -- though it has warned that growth in overall subscribers could slow throughout the course of the year.\n\nA renewed warning on Thursday that the results could be lower than expected in the current quarter sent Netflix shares lower in after-hours trading.\n\nStill, Netflix is seen as reigning supreme over the video content market, with Disney+ still struggling nearly five years after a launch that featured a slew of new content from its blockbuster Marvel and Star Wars universes.\n\nNetflix earned an industry-leading 107 nominations for the Emmys earlier this week, with 11 nods for its surprise hit, the black comedy \"Baby Reindeer.\"\n\nIn terms of viewership, Netflix also scored big with \"Under Paris,\" a shark horror movie from France that the company said had reached 91 million views.\n\nThe third season of \"Bridgerton\" scored 98.5 million views in the quarter, while upcoming shows include the eagerly awaited second season of \"Squid Game,\" which will come with a video game.\n\nThe dystopian Korean horror tale about a fictional, deadly game show remains by far the most-watched Netflix TV series ever.\n\n'Signs of waning'\n\nAnalysts warned however that competitors, at some point, could figure out how to challenge Netflix.\n\n\"The competition is starting to catch up to Netflix as the company's market dominance shows signs of waning,\" said Mike Proulx, vice president at market research firm Forrester.\n\nHe noted a survey that showed the amount of monthly US users streaming from the platform had dipped, with the rivals seeing growth.\n\n\"This makes it all the more critical for Netflix to continue to double down on its ads business as a means to diversify and grow revenue,\" Proulx added.\n\nNetflix is also branching out into live entertainment and in the United States, with plans to broadcast two National Football League games for the first time.\n\nThe company said that it is not only up against its direct competitors, such as Disney, Apple or Amazon, but also the wider range of entertainment platforms, from YouTube and video games to TikTok and TV channels.\n\nIn June, YouTube was the leading streaming TV service in the United States by audience, with almost 10 percent of the video market share, and Netflix in second place with 8.4 percent, according to the Nielsen Institute.\n\nBecause the main battle is for viewer attention, Netflix plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers next year, which some investors have interpreted as a sign of problems about future growth.", "source": {"uri": "telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The company's ad revenue is expected to have more than doubled in the June quarter. Netflix likely added the fewest number of subscribers in five quarters during April-June as sharp gains following a crackdown on password sharing ebbed and viewer attention moved to summer sporting events including the Euro soccer tournament.\n\nThe company added an estimated 4.82 million subscribers in the second quarter, according to LSEG data. That would be the lowest additions since the first quarter of 2023 and about half the 9.3 million it added in the previous three months.\n\nStill, the streaming giant's efforts to sell a lower-priced ad-supported tier have yielded strong ad revenue growth. The company's ad revenue is expected to have more than doubled in the June quarter.\n\nOverall revenue likely rose 16.4% to $9.53 billion, marking the fastest growth since the second quarter of 2021.\n\nNetflix's original shows such as the historical romance \"Bridgerton\" and the limited series \"Baby Reindeer\" - based on comedian Richard Gadd's experience with a stalker - topped most-watched charts in the second quarter, according to Nielsen data.\n\nWhen it reports second-quarter results on Thursday, investors will scrutinize the streaming giant's efforts to expand its lower-priced plan with advertising and look for updates on new growth drivers.\n\nIn May, the company said its ad-supported tier reached 40 million monthly active users across the globe and accounted for 40% of all sign-ups in the countries it was available, up from 23 million in January.\n\nThe ad push has resonated with investors. For the year, Netflix's stock is up nearly 35%, compared with a return of about 19% on the S&P 500 index.\n\nSeasonally, viewership during summer months for Netflix and its rivals such as Disney+ also takes a hit as people travel. This year, the Olympic Games that begin on July 26 are also expected to draw some viewers away from Netflix, according to analysts.\n\nAd focus\n\nAfter investing heavily in originals, brokerage MoffettNathanson noted Netflix is also able to drive viewership with its competitors' content. Eighteen of the top 20 streamed titles were acquired shows, such as \"NCIS\" or \"Grey's Anatomy,\" it noted.\n\nNetflix has also announced bundling partnerships. Comcast is offering Netflix with its Peacock streaming service and Apple TV+ for its Xfinity internet and TV customers.\n\nNetflix is also hosting more live content, including its deal to stream two National Football League games on Christmas Day, to create advertiser-friendly events.\n\n\"More live-event announcements will ensue as the company looks to improve its ad-supported time spent, amid an industry-wide reduction in scripted content production,\" Ross Benes, senior analyst at Emarketer, said.\n\nTo drive the next phase of growth, Netflix announced plans in May to build an in-house ad technology platform that will offer marketers more ways to buy commercials and measure their performance. It initially leaned on Microsoft to build the backbone of the ad tier.\n\n\"Despite this progress, we continue to view advertising as a longer term story and do not expect a material revenue contribution until 2025,\" BofA Global Research analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said in a note on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETTelecom.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_series_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Limited series (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfinity", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xfinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Product bundling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey's_Anatomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grey's Anatomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCIS (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-111809699,imgsize-223184,width-1200,height=765,overlay-ettelecom/mvas-apps/netflixs-efforts-to-grow-ad-tier-in-focus-as-subscriber-growth-slows.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 2060, "textEnd": 2067}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

However, existing users were allowed to keep the basic plan.\n\nIn January, the company said it would retire its cheapest ad-free tier in Canada and the UK. On Thursday, the company said the US and France are next.\n\nBasic users in the US who want an ad-free viewing experience on Netflix will now have two choices: Netflix's Standard plan, which costs $15.49 per month, and its Premium plan, which costs $22.99 per month.\n\nNetflix said its cheapest, ad-supported tier, its \"Standard with ads\" plan, saw a 34% jump in sign-ups in the second quarter of this year.\n\nThe company reported a record-high 277.65 million subscribers on its streaming platform Thursday, far outpacing streaming competitors like Disney+, Peacock and Max (which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN's parent company). Overall, Netflix added 8.05 million new subscribers in its second quarter.\n\nNetflix's surge in new subscribers has been fueled in part by the company's effort to push users who share passwords to create their own accounts.\n\nHowever, the short-term subscriber jolt from the password-sharing crackdown could soon fade. On Thursday, Netflix said it expects the pace of its subscriber additions to slow in the third quarter.\n\nNetflix's stock fell nearly 2% in after-hours trading, but it has climbed more than 35% in 2024.\n\nThe company recently disclosed that it would stop sharing its quarterly subscriber numbers beginning in 2025 in favor of a new disclosure: time spent on the platform.\n\nNetflix, in the past two months, has also pushed further into the world of live sports programming and experiences.\n\nAnd with Netflix's recent advance into advertising, the company is starting to look closer to the traditional media companies it seeks to disrupt, said Tim Nollen, a Netflix analyst at Macquarie.\n\n\"Whatever the old broadcasters were in their best of times, Netflix is becoming that in a new and probably longer-term, sustainable way,\" he said.\n\nThe early stages of Netflix's evolution\n\nNetflix made its biggest sports announcement yet in May. The company made a three-year deal to broadcast the NFL's Christmas Day games. The deal kicks off this year with Netflix globally airing two NFL games on the holiday. In 2025 and 2026, Netflix will stream at least one holiday game.\n\n\"Netflix is now in live sports,\" Nollen said. \"This means Netflix might be the only place you will be able to watch those two Christmas Day games, which could obviously add more subscribers.\"\n\nAiring football games has proven itself to be a winning strategy to juice subscriber numbers: In January, Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service, saw a jump of 2.8 million sign-ups in the three days leading up to its exclusive airing of an NFL playoff game.\n\nThe event was \"the single biggest subscriber acquisition moment ever measured\" by Peacock, according to the company.\n\nEarlier this year, Netflix also announced another high-profile foray into sports programming: A 10-year deal to air \"WWE Raw\" live, valued at more than $5 billion.\n\n\"We're in live because our members love it. It drives a ton of engagement and it drives a ton of excitement, and those two things are very valuable,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on the company's earnings call Thursday. \"The good thing is advertisers like it too.\"\n\nBut live sports aren't the only way Netflix is trying to expand its footprint. Last month, the company said it plans to open two massive entertainment venues called Netflix Houses.\n\nThe \"experiential\" complexes, in former department store locations at Dallas Galleria and King of Prussia mall (near Philadelphia), will each span more than 100,000 square feet and include events, themed gift shops and restaurants.

This growth was driven by a crackdown on password sharing and the popularity of titles such as \"Bridgerton,\" \"Baby Reindeer,\" and \"The Roast of Tom Brady.\"Thank you for reading this post, don't forget to subscribe!\n\nDespite the impressive subscriber growth, Netflix provided cautious guidance for the third quarter and noted that its advertising business would not significantly contribute to revenue growth until at least 2026.\n\nAfter initially dipping, Netflix shares rose 1% in after-hours trading and have surged nearly a third this year. Michael Ashley Schulman, CIO at Running Point Capital, remarked, \"Netflix is still the best and most profitable streaming company, but technology stocks have been retreating recently, prompting some investors to sell on the good news and await a better re-entry point.\"\n\nFacing market saturation in the United States, Netflix plans to stop regularly reporting new subscriber additions next year. Investors are increasingly focused on Netflix's burgeoning advertising business as a potential growth driver.\n\nNetflix projected lower third-quarter subscriber gains compared to the same period in 2023, coinciding with the initial phase of its password-sharing crackdown. Additionally, the company announced the departure of Peter Naylor, VP of Ad Sales.\n\nJamie Lumley, an analyst at Third Bridge, commented on the advertising sector's potential, noting, \"Amazon has made a bigger impact in the ad market, and Netflix needs to scale significantly to become a major player.\"\n\nFor the April-June period, Netflix reported diluted earnings per share of $4.88, exceeding the consensus forecast of $4.74. Revenue for the quarter was $9.56 billion, matching estimates. The total number of global subscribers reached over 277 million by the end of June.\n\nWhile Netflix's ad tier membership grew by 34% from the previous quarter, the company did not disclose the number of subscribers opting for this tier. \"Our ad business is growing nicely and becoming a more meaningful contributor,\" Netflix stated, emphasizing that building a substantial advertising business takes time.\n\nCFO Spencer Neumann echoed this sentiment, acknowledging the current growth from a small base but expressing optimism for significant contributions by 2026 and beyond.\n\nNetflix anticipates a 14% revenue growth for the third quarter compared to the previous year. In its third year of venturing into video games, Netflix plans to release a multiplayer game based on \"Squid Game\" alongside Season Two of the series. Other upcoming games include titles related to \"Emily in Paris\" and \"Selling Sunset.\"", "source": {"uri": "naija247news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija247news"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(radio_network)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital (radio network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_information_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief information officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selling_Sunset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selling Sunset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_in_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emily in Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multiplayer video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://naija247news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/netflix_pr_darwin_tv-ui_marvelsdaredevil_english_us.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 7}], "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

That would be the lowest additions since the first quarter of 2023 and about half the 9.3 million it added in the previous three months.\n\nStill, the streaming giant's efforts to sell a lower-priced ad-supported tier have yielded strong ad revenue growth. The company's ad revenue is expected to have more than doubled in the June quarter.\n\nOverall revenue likely rose 16.4 per cent to $9.53-billion, marking the fastest growth since the second quarter of 2021.\n\nNetflix's original shows such as the historical romance \"Bridgerton\" and the limited series \"Baby Reindeer\" - based on comedian Richard Gadd's experience with a stalker - topped most-watched charts in the second quarter, according to Nielsen data.\n\nWhen it reports second-quarter results on Thursday, investors will scrutinize the streaming giant's efforts to expand its lower-priced plan with advertising and look for updates on new growth drivers.\n\nIn May, the company said its ad-supported tier reached 40 million monthly active users across the globe and accounted for 40 per cent of all sign-ups in the countries it was available, up from 23 million in January.\n\nThe ad push has resonated with investors. For the year, Netflix's stock is up nearly 35 per cent, compared with a return of about 19 per cent on the S&P 500 index.\n\nSeasonally, viewership during summer months for Netflix and its rivals such as Disney+ also takes a hit as people travel. This year, the Olympic Games that begin on July 26 are also expected to draw some viewers away from Netflix, according to analysts.\n\nAfter investing heavily in originals, brokerage MoffettNathanson noted Netflix is also able to drive viewership with its competitors' content. Eighteen of the top 20 streamed titles were acquired shows, such as \"NCIS\" or \"Grey's Anatomy,\" it noted.\n\nNetflix has also announced bundling partnerships. Comcast is offering Netflix with its Peacock streaming service and Apple TV+ for its Xfinity internet and TV customers.\n\nNetflix is also hosting more live content, including its deal to stream two National Football League games on Christmas Day, to create advertiser-friendly events.\n\n\"More live-event announcements will ensue as the company looks to improve its ad-supported time spent, amid an industry-wide reduction in scripted content production,\" Ross Benes, senior analyst at Emarketer, said.\n\nTo drive the next phase of growth, Netflix announced plans in May to build an in-house ad technology platform that will offer marketers more ways to buy commercials and measure their performance. It initially leaned on Microsoft to build the backbone of the ad tier.\n\n\"Despite this progress, we continue to view advertising as a longer term story and do not expect a material revenue contribution until 2025,\" BofA Global Research analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said in a note on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_series_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Limited series (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfinity", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xfinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Product bundling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey's_Anatomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grey's Anatomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCIS (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/ALFOTPZOA5CTZJKFDH56TFI6QY.JPG?auth=eb5cf2e57e550a401b180ed72c874d3b945a4e930bbd9585863331fd0d66ab9b&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 1814, "textEnd": 1821}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Here's what analysts are watching", "body": "Netflix, which is firmly holding the reins as the dominant streaming platform, is set to report its second quarter earnings on Thursday. The report will provide keen insights into the current state of play of streaming.\n\nNetflix's stock has outperformed most major streamers this year, rising 36%, to about $657, since the beginning of the year. For comparison, Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discover stocks have both slipped this year, down 26% and 36%, respectively.\n\nNetflix is even outpacing all but two -- Meta and Nvida -- of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks.\n\nBut the world of streaming is ever changing, with new platforms emerging each year, alternate revenue models like ads becoming more prevalent, and significant mergers such as the recent Paramount-Skydance deal.\n\nHere is what to look for in Netflix's upcoming earnings report:\n\nIn its last quarterly earnings report, Netflix warned of a potential dip in subscribers in the second quarter due to \"seasonality\" and the company's crackdown on password sharing. The streaming giant also said that it plans to stop reporting subscriber stats starting in 2025, signaling a shift in focus from subscriber growth to profit.\n\nHowever, JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth, who raised his price target for Netflix to $750 on Friday, projects that Netflix will will report 5 million to 6 million net new subscribers for the second quarter, beating the FactSet consensus estimate of about 3.7 million.\n\nOne way Netflix and other streamers are attempting to increase their profitability is by betting on ads -- and it seems like Netflix is all-in on this approach.\n\nAt one point, it looked like streaming would bring the end to television commercials. Now, though, almost all streaming services offer an ad-supported plan. Netflix first introduced ads to its service in 2022.\n\nIn May, Netflix said that its ad plan has since grown to 40 million active users and that 40% of all new signups to the streaming service are for its $6.99 ad-supported tier. The company also plans to launch an in-house advertising technology platform by the end of next year.\n\nGoldman Sachs estimates that Netflix could generate nearly $3 billion in advertising revenue in 2024.\n\nA key selling point of streaming has always been its ability to offer thousands of hours of content on demand, but in recent years streamers have noticed that live programming can drive subscriptions.\n\nNetflix has experimented with live programming in the past and has announced some future programs, such as NFL games on Christmas and a food eating competition with 16-time hot dog eating champion Joey Chestnut and his rival Takeru Kobayashi. However, the company is still lagging behind its competition in this arena.\n\n\"While Netflix is the market leader and has been the biggest innovator in entertainment streaming, live events and sports are areas where it's playing catchup with competitors like Amazon, YouTube, Disney and NBCUniversal,\" Paul Verna, an analyst at eMarketer, told MarketWatch.", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertisement_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertisement film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Chestnut", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joey Chestnut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarketWatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MarketWatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBCUniversal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hot dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/3f1c07c883c9469896d39a98dd46c433.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

That would be the lowest additions since the first quarter of 2023 and about half the 9.3 million it added in the previous three months.\n\nStill, the streaming giant's efforts to sell a lower-priced ad-supported tier have yielded strong ad revenue growth. The company's ad revenue is expected to have more than doubled in the June quarter.\n\nOverall revenue likely rose 16.4% to $9.53 billion, marking the fastest growth since the second quarter of 2021.\n\nNetflix's original shows such as the historical romance \"Bridgerton\" and the limited series \"Baby Reindeer\" - based on comedian Richard Gadd's experience with a stalker - topped most-watched charts in the second quarter, according to Nielsen data.\n\nWhen it reports second-quarter results on Thursday, investors will scrutinize the streaming giant's efforts to expand its lower-priced plan with advertising and look for updates on new growth drivers.\n\nIn May, the company said its ad-supported tier reached 40 million monthly active users across the globe and accounted for 40% of all sign-ups in the countries it was available, up from 23 million in January.\n\nThe ad push has resonated with investors. For the year, Netflix's stock is up nearly 35%, compared with a return of about 19% on the S&P 500 index (.SPX), opens new tab.\n\nSeasonally, viewership during summer months for Netflix and its rivals such as Disney+ also takes a hit as people travel. This year, the Olympic Games that begin on July 26 are also expected to draw some viewers away from Netflix, according to analysts.\n\nAD FOCUS\n\nAfter investing heavily in originals, brokerage MoffettNathanson noted Netflix is also able to drive viewership with its competitors' content. Eighteen of the top 20 streamed titles were acquired shows, such as \"NCIS\" or \"Grey's Anatomy,\" it noted.\n\nNetflix has also announced bundling partnerships. Comcast (CMCSA.O), opens new tab is offering Netflix with its Peacock streaming service and Apple TV+ for its Xfinity internet and TV customers.\n\nNetflix is also hosting more live content, including its deal to stream two National Football League games on Christmas Day, to create advertiser-friendly events.\n\n\"More live-event announcements will ensue as the company looks to improve its ad-supported time spent, amid an industry-wide reduction in scripted content production,\" Ross Benes, senior analyst at Emarketer, said.\n\nTo drive the next phase of growth, Netflix announced plans in May to build an in-house ad technology platform that will offer marketers more ways to buy commercials and measure their performance. It initially leaned on Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab to build the backbone of the ad tier.\n\n\"Despite this progress, we continue to view advertising as a longer term story and do not expect a material revenue contribution until 2025,\" BofA Global Research analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said in a note on Monday.\n\nReporting by Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles;

subscribers in the second quarter, as the home of hit shows \"The Crown\" and \"Bridgerton\" posted its latest financial earnings that exceeded analyst expectations.\n\nThe world's leading streaming video service said it ended the April-to-June period with a total of 277.7 million subscribers, as net profit dipped to $2.1 billion, but revenue surged to $9.6 billion.\n\nThe latest numbers rewarded Netflix's moves to boost revenue after a rough patch in 2022.\n\nIn a bid to boost sputtering growth, the company launched an ad-subsidized offering last year around the same time as a crackdown on sharing passwords.\n\nAs part of that effort, Netflix also got rid of its cheapest commercial-free plan in the UK and Canada, with expectations of further expansions.\n\nIn the United States, the company is also beginning to offer some users combined packages with its one-time rivals, making itself available through joint subscriptions with Peacock and Apple TV.\n\nNetflix in May said its ad-supported tier reached 40 million monthly active users across the globe and accounted for 40 percent of all sign-ups in the countries where it was available, up from 23 million in January.\n\nThe company also launched an in-house advertising platform so that brands can better optimize its customer data, no longer partnering with Microsoft for that technology.\n\nInvestors have cheered on the moves, with Netflix shares gaining 38 percent since the beginning of the year -- though it has warned that growth in overall subscribers could slow throughout the course of the year.\n\nA renewed warning on Thursday that the results could be lower than expected in the current quarter sent Netflix shares lower in after hours trading.\n\nStill, Netflix is seen as reigning supreme over the video content market, with Disney+ still struggling nearly five years after a launch that featured a slew of new content from its blockbuster Marvel and Star Wars universes.\n\nNetflix earned an industry-leading 107 nominations for the Emmys earlier this week, with 11 nods for its surprise hit, the black comedy \"Baby Reindeer.\"\n\nAfter the successful new season of \"Bridgerton\" earlier this year, upcoming shows include the eagerly awaited second season of \"Squid Game.\"\n\nThe dystopian Korean horror tale about a fictional, deadly game show remains by far the most-watched Netflix TV series ever.\n\nAnalysts warned however that competition, at some point, could figure out how to challenge Netflix.\n\n\"The competition is starting to catch up to Netflix as the company's market dominance shows signs of waning,\" said Mike Proulx, vice-president at Forrester.\n\nHe noted a survey that showed the amount of monthly US users streaming from the platform had dipped, with the rivals seeing growth.\n\n\"This makes it all the more critical for Netflix to continue to double down on its ads business as a means to diversify and grow revenue,\" he added.\n\nNetflix is also branching out into live entertainment and in the United States, with plans to broadcast two National Football League games for the first time.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com",

Analysts had projected revenue of $9.53 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nNetflix has impressed investors as the company cracks down on password sharing, grows its lower-priced ad-supported subscription tier and puts out a steady stream of popular original programs.\n\nThe steamer's stock price has increased roughly 35% so far this year. Its shares closed at $643.04 on Thursday, down 0.7%. The shares fell about 2% in after-hours trading.\n\n\"If we execute well -- better stories, easier discovery and more fandom -- while also establishing ourselves in newer areas like live (programming), games and advertising, we believe that we have a lot more room to grow,\" Netflix said in a letter to shareholders Thursday.\n\nNetflix has remained the dominant subscription streaming platform in part because of its content prowess with licensed titles and its own franchises, including the Shonda Rhimes Regency-era alt-history romance series \"Bridgerton.\"\n\nIn the second quarter, Netflix was helped by the release of popular programs including the third season of \"Bridgerton\"; limited drama series \"Baby Reindeer,\" which received 11 Emmy nominations Wednesday; the Jennifer Lopez action movie \"Atlas\"; and \"The Roast of Tom Brady,\" which the streamer said attracted its largest live audience so far.\n\nThe company forecast revenue growth of 14% to 15% this year.\n\nAnd in another bright spot, the number of sign-ups for subscriptions with ads grew 34% in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter.\n\nThat boost was helped by Netflix ending its cheapest ad-free subscription tier, the Basic plan, in the United Kingdom and Canada. The company said in a Thursday shareholder letter that it will begin phasing out the Basic plan in France and the U.S.\n\nDespite the growth in its advertising business, Netflix is making changes to its ads leadership, with Peter Naylor, its vice president of ad sales, leaving the company. Netflix said it plans to hire a head of U.S. and Canada ad sales to replace Naylor's more global job.\n\n\"Peter's enthusiasm, industry knowledge and relationships have been invaluable in getting our advertising business off the ground,\" said Amy Reinhard, Netflix president of advertising.\n\nIn an earnings presentation, Netflix executives touted progress in its gaming efforts, with more than 100 games launched so far.\n\nThe company has released games based on some of its most popular shows, including reality dating series \"Too Hot to Handle,\" which Netflix says can help drive gamers to watch the show or the show's fans to spend more time with Netflix playing the games.\n\n\"I think our opportunity here to serve super fandom with games is really fun and remarkable,\" Netflix co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos said in the earnings presentation Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Gatos,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Gatos, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Gatos, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regency_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regency era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shonda_Rhimes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shonda Rhimes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fandom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_Hot_to_Handle_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Too Hot to Handle (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Sarandos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Sarandos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/298/29858/2985807.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Discovery). Overall, Netflix gained 8.05 million new subscribers in the second quarter.\n\nNetflix's surge in new subscribers is largely due to the company's efforts to encourage users who share passwords to create their own accounts.\n\nBut any short-term subscriber surge caused by the password-sharing crackdown may soon fade: Netflix said Thursday it expects its subscriber growth to slow in the third quarter.\n\nNetflix shares fell about 2% in after-hours trading but are up more than 35% in 2024.\n\nThe company recently revealed that after 2025 it will stop disclosing quarterly subscriber numbers and will instead release a new metric of time spent on the platform.\n\nOver the past two months, Netflix has been expanding further into the world of live sports programming and experiences.\n\nMacquarie Netflix analyst Tim Nolen said Netflix's recent forays into advertising have the company turning its attention to the traditional media companies it is trying to disrupt.\n\nWhatever broadcast networks were in their heyday, Netflix is approaching it in a new, and perhaps long-term, sustainable way, he said.\n\nNetflix made its biggest sports-related announcement to date in May: the company signed a three-year deal to broadcast NFL Christmas games. The deal kicks off this year and will see Netflix air two NFL games around the world on Christmas Day. In 2025 and 2026, Netflix plans to stream at least one Christmas game.\n\nNolen noted that Netflix currently broadcasts live sports, meaning it may be the only place people can watch the two games on Christmas Day, which could naturally attract more subscribers.\n\nBroadcasting football games has proven to be a surefire strategy to drive subscriber numbers: In January, NBCUniversal's streaming service Peacock saw its subscriber numbers surge by 2.8 million in the three days prior to its exclusive broadcast of NFL playoff games.\n\nThe company said the event was the largest subscriber acquisition event it has ever measured.\n\nEarlier this year, Netflix also announced another notable foray into sports programming: a 10-year deal to broadcast WWE Raw live, valued at more than $5 billion.\n\n\"We're doing livestreaming because our members love it. It generates a lot of engagement and a lot of excitement, and those are two very valuable things,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the company's earnings call on Thursday. And the good news is, advertisers love it, too.\n\nBut live sports isn't the only area Netflix is looking to expand into: Last month, the company announced plans to open two massive entertainment venues it's calling Netflix House.\n\nThe experiential complexes, which will be built on former department store sites at the Dallas Galleria and King of Prussia Mall near Philadelphia, will each be more than 100,000 square feet and will include events, themed gift shops, restaurants, and more. Both are scheduled to open in 2025.\n\nWhile the complexes won't match the size or footprint of global theme parks offered by Disney or Universal, Seaport analyst David Joyce said they are designed to foster brand loyalty.\n\nThis should help retain those customers, keep them in the Netflix ecosystem and keep them paying subscription fees for a longer period of time, he said.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Investors have been zeroing in on the company's relatively new advertising business as a potential source of growth.\n\nOn Thursday, Netflix said third-quarter subscriber gains would be lower than the comparable period in 2023 when it had just started the password clamp-down.\n\nThe company also said its vice president of ad sales, Peter Naylor, was departing.\n\nThird Bridge analyst Jamie Lumley said Netflix's advertising business \"has yet to prove itself from a revenue standpoint.\"\n\n\"Our experts highlight that Amazon has made a much bigger splash in the ad market and Netflix needs to continue working on scale in this segment if it wants to be a major player,\" Lumley said.\n\nFor April through June, Netflix posted diluted per-share earnings of $4.88, compared with consensus forecasts of $4.74 a share, according to LSEG.

However, existing users were allowed to keep the basic plan.\n\nIn January, the company said it would retire its cheapest ad-free tier in Canada and the UK. On Thursday, the company said the US and France are next.\n\nBasic users in the US who want an ad-free viewing experience on Netflix will now have two choices: Netflix's Standard plan, which costs $15.49 per month, and its Premium plan, which costs $22.99 per month.\n\nNetflix said its cheapest, ad-supported tier, its \"Standard with ads\" plan, saw a 34% jump in sign-ups in the second quarter of this year.\n\nThe company reported a record-high 277.65 million subscribers on its streaming platform Thursday, far outpacing streaming competitors like Disney+, Peacock and Max (which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN's parent company). Overall, Netflix added 8.05 million new subscribers in its second quarter.\n\nNetflix's surge in new subscribers has been fueled in part by the company's effort to push users who share passwords to create their own accounts.\n\nHowever, the short-term subscriber jolt from the password-sharing crackdown could soon fade. On Thursday, Netflix said it expects the pace of its subscriber additions to slow in the third quarter.\n\nNetflix's stock fell nearly 2% in after-hours trading, but it has climbed more than 35% in 2024.\n\nThe company recently disclosed that it would stop sharing its quarterly subscriber numbers beginning in 2025 in favor of a new disclosure: time spent on the platform.\n\nNetflix, in the past two months, has also pushed further into the world of live sports programming and experiences.\n\nAnd with Netflix's recent advance into advertising, the company is starting to look closer to the traditional media companies it seeks to disrupt, said Tim Nollen, a Netflix analyst at Macquarie.\n\n\"Whatever the old broadcasters were in their best of times, Netflix is becoming that in a new and probably longer-term, sustainable way,\" he said.\n\nNetflix made its biggest sports announcement yet in May. The company made a three-year deal to broadcast the NFL's Christmas Day games. The deal kicks off this year with Netflix globally airing two NFL games on the holiday. In 2025 and 2026, Netflix will stream at least one holiday game.\n\n\"Netflix is now in live sports,\" Nollen said. \"This means Netflix might be the only place you will be able to watch those two Christmas Day games, which could obviously add more subscribers.\"\n\nAiring football games has proven itself to be a winning strategy to juice subscriber numbers: In January, Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service, saw a jump of 2.8 million sign-ups in the three days leading up to its exclusive airing of an NFL playoff game.\n\nThe event was \"the single biggest subscriber acquisition moment ever measured\" by Peacock, according to the company.\n\nEarlier this year, Netflix also announced another high-profile foray into sports programming: A 10-year deal to air \"WWE Raw\" live, valued at more than $5 billion.\n\n\"We're in live because our members love it. It drives a ton of engagement and it drives a ton of excitement, and those two things are very valuable,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on the company's earnings call Thursday. \"The good thing is advertisers like it too.\"\n\nBut live sports aren't the only way Netflix is trying to expand its footprint. Last month, the company said it plans to open two massive entertainment venues called Netflix Houses.\n\nThe \"experiential\" complexes, in former department store locations at Dallas Galleria and King of Prussia mall (near Philadelphia), will each span more than 100,000 square feet and include events, themed gift shops and restaurants. Both will open in 2025.\n\nWhile these complexes don't quite reach the scale or footprint of Disney's or Universal's global theme parks, David Joyce, an analyst at Seaport, said the complexes are designed to drive brand loyalty.\n\n\"It should help retain those customers and keep them in the Netflix ecosystem and paying for their subscriptions for longer,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ksltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSLTV.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

It also wants Wall Street to focus on how satisfied its customers are more than how many subscribers the company brings in.\n\nThe group will stop reporting quarterly subscriber gains next year, having already dumped its regular forecasts for quarterly additions. It's looking to wring more cash from its lower-priced plans, which show ads within its streaming content.\n\nNetflix in fact told investors in May that its ad-supported tier, which costs around $6.99 a month, topped 40 million active users that month, up from just 5 million over the year-earlier month.\n\nStill, Wall Street at present remains focused on subscriber additions. Analysts expect Netflix brought in a net 4.82 million new users over the three months ended in June, a tally that would be the smallest in more than a year.\n\nNetflix pushing into live events\n\nThat's still likely to help drive revenue 16% above the year-earlier quarter, however, to around $9.5 billion. Analysts also say the figure could rise as high as $9.8 billion over the three months ending in September as the group mulls new price increases to match recent moves by its competitors.\n\n\"In our view, recent price increases by competitors and ongoing low rates of churn support Netflix price increases over coming quarters,\" said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Justin Patterson, who recently lifted his Netflix price target by $22 to $735 a share. (Churn is the measure of subscribers switching to rival services.)\n\nRelated: Analysts rewire Netflix stock price target ahead of earnings\n\n\"As pricing returns to a more normal cadence, we believe Netflix has ample room to sustain more than 10% annual revenue growth with 2% to 3% annual operating-margin expansion,\" he added.\n\nNetflix is also looking to beef up its offerings of live programming, which are crucial to the growth of advertising-based video on demand. These include the addition of two National Football League games on Christmas Day and next year's launch of WWE \"Raw\" wrestling events.\n\nIn January Netflix agreed to pay TKO Group Holdings $5 billion for the streaming rights to \"Raw,\" the WWE's flagship weekly wrestling program. Streaming is slated to start in 2025.\n\nEmmy haul\n\n\"Netflix's still limited foray into live major sports with Christmas NFL games complementing scripted WWE content and successful behind the scenes efforts including Drive to Survive and Break Point reinforces a view that streaming bundles will increasingly emulate the traditional linear bundle,\" said Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan.\n\nOriginal content has also been increasingly important for Netflix, although its recent slate has been helped by shows that it licenses from mainstream networks as well.\n\nRelated: Analyst reboots Trade Desk stock price target after Netflix deal\n\nLast summer's strikes by both the the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild hit Netflix hard, ultimately reducing its overall offering of TV and movie titles by around 15%, following at least a decade of increases. Netflix now looks to be focusing on quality over quantity.\n\nMore Tech Stocks:\n\nNetflix earned a total of 107 Emmy nominations this year for titles including \"The Crown,\" \"The Bear\" and the controversial series \"Baby Reindeer.\" Winners are slated to be announced Sept. 15.\n\nNetflix shares were marked 0.36% higher in premarket trading to indicate an opening bell price of $649.82 each.

Netflix is counting on its advertising business becoming the next one.\n\nThe streaming giant launched its first ad-supported offerings in late 2022. Those tiers are much cheaper than the company's regular plans, and they seem to be gaining traction. Netflix said in its second-quarter report late Thursday that 45% of its new sign-ups pick ad-supported plans in markets where available. But they cost much less than ad-free alternatives, and advertisers don't seem to be flooding in just yet. Analysts estimate that Netflix generated just under $800 million in ad-supported revenue in the first half of this year, or 4% of the company's total, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.\n\nNetflix seemed to confirm Thursday that the ad business is off to a slow start, writing in its letter to shareholders, \"We don't expect advertising to be a primary driver of our revenue growth in 2024 or 2025.\" In a later conference call, co-Chief Executive Officer Greg Peters said the company also is still hiring people for ad sales and operations and \"building our capabilities to meet advertisers.\" The tempered view on advertising offset some otherwise strong results, with Netflix adding another 8.1 million net new paying subscribers during the June quarter. Netflix shares were flat in after-hours trading on Thursday following an initial slip.\n\nNetflix is the undisputed leader in the streaming market, with nearly 278 million subscribers globally paying specifically to watch the company's programming. It is therefore only a matter of time before the company scales up its ad operations enough to effectively serve the portion of that huge base that is willing to watch ads. But time is of the essence: Other streamers are also getting hot on ads. Amazon jumped into the market earlier this year by making ads the default option for viewers of its Prime Video service. And that company already has the chops to compete, having built up a digital advertising business for its retail operation that now generates more than $49 billion in annual revenue.\n\nAds will also become more crucial for Netflix as the boost from its password-sharing crackdown begins to fade. Netflix has added a little more than 39 million new subscribers over the past four quarters -- more than twice the number added during the previous four quarters.\n\nBut Netflix also warned Thursday that subscriber growth in the third quarter will be less than last year because of the challenging comparisons created by its password-sharing crackdown. The company also plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers beginning next year. That will leave investors grappling with new ways to value a business that has long been measured on eyeball growth.\n\nTV viewers once hated annoying ad breaks.

In the first quarter of 2024, Netflix's revenue was $9.37 billion, up 15% from the prior year.\n\nEarnings are also expected to rise\n\nRegarding earnings, Netflix forecasts net income of $2.06 billion, or $4.68 per share, for the second quarter of 2024 whereas analysts estimate Netflix's Q2 earnings per share will reach $4.74. For comparison, in Q2 2023, Netflix reported net income of $1.48 billion, or $3.29 per share.

Engagement remained solid despite changes like paid sharing.\n\n[Source: TradingEconomics]\n\nFor Q2 2024, Netflix forecasts $2.52 billion in operating income and 26.6% operating margin, versus $1.82 billion and 22.3% in Q2 2023.

While this area underpins, the short-term uptrend will remain valid.\n\nFor a medium-term top to be formed, the Netflix share price would have to fall through its $626.44 June low.

In 2025 and 2026, Netflix will stream at least one holiday game.\n\n\"Netflix is now in live sports,\" Nollen said. \"This means Netflix might be the only place you will be able to watch those two Christmas Day games, which could obviously add more subscribers.\"\n\nAiring football games has proven itself to be a winning strategy to juice subscriber numbers: In January, Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service, saw a jump of 2.8 million sign-ups in the three days leading up to its exclusive airing of an NFL playoff game.\n\nThe event was \"the single biggest subscriber acquisition moment ever measured\" by Peacock, according to the company.\n\nMovies & TV\n\n'Shogun' leads all Emmy nominees with 25 and 'The Bear' sets comedy series record with 23\n\nBy ANDREW DALTON AP Entertainment Writer\n\nEarlier this year, Netflix also announced another high-profile foray into sports programming: A 10-year deal to air \"WWE Raw\" live, valued at more than $5 billion.\n\nBut sports aren't the only way Netflix is trying to expand its footprint. Last month, the company said it plans to open two massive entertainment venues called Netflix Houses.\n\nThe \"experiential\" complexes, in former department store locations at Dallas Galleria and King of Prussia mall (near Philadelphia), will each span more than 100,000 square feet and include events, themed gift shops and restaurants. Both will open in 2025.\n\nWhile these complexes don't quite reach the scale or footprint of Disney's or Universal's global theme parks, David Joyce, an analyst at Seaport, said the complexes are designed to drive brand loyalty.\n\n\"It should help retain those customers and keep them in the Netflix ecosystem and paying for their subscriptions for longer,\" he said.\n\nNetflix cancels cheapest plan as subscribers have to choose\n\nNarrower choices", "source": {"uri": "magicvalley.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Magic Valley"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bear (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

off", "body": "Netflix on Thursday said it added eight million new subscribers in the second quarter, as the home of hit shows \"The Crown\" and \"Bridgerton\" posted its latest financial earnings that exceeded analyst expectations.\n\nThe world's leading streaming video service said it ended the April-to-June period with a total of 277.7 million subscribers, as net profit dipped to $2.1 billion, but revenue surged to $9.6 billion.\n\nThe latest numbers rewarded Netflix's moves to boost revenue after a rough patch in 2022.\n\nIn a bid to boost sputtering growth, the company launched an ad-subsidized offering last year around the same time as a crackdown on sharing passwords.\n\nAs part of that effort, Netflix also got rid of its cheapest commercial-free plan in the UK and Canada, with expectations of further expansions.\n\nIn the United States, the company is also beginning to offer some users combined packages with its one-time rivals, making itself available through joint subscriptions with Peacock and Apple TV.\n\nNetflix in May said its ad-supported tier reached 40 million monthly active users across the globe and accounted for 40 percent of all sign-ups in the countries where it was available, up from 23 million in January.\n\nThe company also launched an in-house advertising platform so that brands can better optimize its customer data, no longer partnering with Microsoft for that technology.\n\nInvestors have cheered on the moves, with Netflix shares gaining 38 percent since the beginning of the year -- though it has warned that growth in overall subscribers could slow throughout the course of the year.\n\nA renewed warning on Thursday that the results could be lower than expected in the current quarter sent Netflix shares lower in after hours trading.\n\nStill, Netflix is seen as reigning supreme over the video content market, with Disney+ still struggling nearly five years after a launch that featured a slew of new content from its blockbuster Marvel and Star Wars universes.\n\nNetflix earned an industry-leading 107 nominations for the Emmys earlier this week, with 11 nods for its surprise hit, the black comedy \"Baby Reindeer.\"\n\nAfter the successful new season of \"Bridgerton\" earlier this year, upcoming shows include the eagerly awaited second season of \"Squid Game.\"\n\nThe dystopian Korean horror tale about a fictional, deadly game show remains by far the most-watched Netflix TV series ever.\n\nAnalysts warned however that competition, at some point, could figure out how to challenge Netflix.\n\n\"The competition is starting to catch up to Netflix as the company's market dominance shows signs of waning,\" said Mike Proulx, vice-president at Forrester.\n\nHe noted a survey that showed the amount of monthly US users streaming from the platform had dipped, with the rivals seeing growth.\n\n\"This makes it all the more critical for Netflix to continue to double down on its ads business as a means to diversify and grow revenue,\" he added.\n\nNetflix is also branching out into live entertainment and in the United States, with plans to broadcast two National Football League games for the first time.\n\narp/des", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [{"uri":

There was the time in April 2022 when the streamer revealed it had lost subscribers for the first time in a decade. Or pick either of the past two quarters, when Netflix added a combined (and rounded) 22.5 million global paid subscribers.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nBut Netflix, which is expected to announce that by the end of June it had reached roughly 275 million subs worldwide, is kind of over this whole subscriber-adds thing. Also last quarter, Netflix revealed that by 2025 it will stop giving quarterly subscriber counts, just to make our jobs a little harder.\n\nThe internal (and Wall Street-facing) key metric has been revenue for a while now, but engagement time (which corresponds to revenue and other KPIs; yes, including membership numbers) is creeping up on the list.\n\nIt's a whole lot, and it's a whole lot of pressure. Netflix is always the first major media company to report its financial results for the quarter. As the pace car of the streaming business, a great quarter from Netflix can mean a good quarter for its followers.\n\nBut what constitutes a great Q2 of 2024 for Netflix? Well, the Wall Street consensus is that Netflix will report the net addition of 4.8 million global paid subscribers from April-June. Of those, 1.1 million are expected to come from the U.S. and Canada. Yes, that'd be a big decline in growth rate from the prior quarters, but those were disproportionately huge in large part due to the password-sharing crackdown.\n\nEven Netflix has told us to hold our horses on this one: When reporting Q1 results in April, executives predicted the June quarter's net additions would be \"down sequentially\" from the recent surge. That said, another big beat is possible. Wall Street thought Netflix would add 4.9 million subs in that first quarter; it added 9.3 million. (In Q4 2023, the consensus analyst forecast was +8.8 million; Netflix reported +13.1 million.)\n\nSince revenue is Netflix's KPI (key performance indicator), let's guess that result. The Wall Street consensus foresees Netflix reporting earnings per share (EPS) of $4.74 on revenue of $9.53 billion. Netflix's own guidance from April estimated Q2 EPS of $4.68 on $9.491 billion.\n\nIn other words, the analysts who study Netflix are a bit more bullish on Netflix than Netflix. But these analysts also have the benefit of tracking the company throughout the quarter -- Netflix itself makes one early estimate and does not update the market.\n\nIf Netflix's track record is not reason enough itself for the optimism, can we interest you in some \"Bridgerton\" viewership brags? Speaking of things to expect to happen on Thursday...\n\nThe third season of \"Bridgerton,\" which premiered its first four episodes on May 16 and its final four episodes on June 13, has already rocketed into Netflix's all time Top 10 for English-language TV shows. As of Tuesday, it is number 6. With months of viewership still to count (roughly two months for Part 2 and one month for Part 1) in Netflix's self-appointed cutoff, \"Bridgerton\" Season 1 (number 4 all-time) is well within its sites. Hell, everything not named \"Wednesday\" (and \"Squid Game\" on the non-English list) is theoretically in its crosshairs.\n\nAnother way to look at the \"Bridgerton\" impact: Last year, viewing hours on Netflix dropped by 12 percent in Q2 (from Q1). This year's decline was 8 percent.\n\nWe're not (the only ones) hating on the rest of Netflix's new content in the June quarter. The analysts at investment bank Evercore wrote in a Monday note to clients (obtained by IndieWire) that beyond \"Bridgerton,\" the quarter's content was \"uneventful.\" Next quarter though we'll see the results from \"Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,\" as well as new seasons of \"The Umbrella Academy,\" \"Cobra Kai,\" and \"Emily in Paris.\" The (rescheduled) Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight would have been the icing on the cake.\n\nAnalysts will be particularly keen on updates about Netflix's ad-tier. \"Paid sharing\" has proven itself; Netflix with Ads has not (yet). In a memo to their own clients (also obtained by IndieWire), analysts at private-banking firm Wedbush said they do not expect the advertising tier to materially contribute to Netflix's ARM (average revenue/member), revenue, earnings, and free cash flow growth until 2025.\n\nAt its May upfront, Netflix said it had 40 million \"viewers\" on its ad-supported tier, which Wedbush estimates translates to 20 million subscribers -- or about 7 percent of the streamer's overall membership base. Netflix's solution? Kill off its Basic Ad-Free pricing tier altogether, pushing frugal SVOD subs to AVOD.\n\nBank of America's Jessica Reif Erlich, a favorite analyst of Netflix's (she's conducted several of the streamer's quarterly earnings interviews solo), concurs with the timeline. How bullish is BoA? Extremely. Reif Erlich just raised her Netflix stock (NFLX) price target to $740, meaning that as of Tuesday's close, NFLX shares still have more than $80 of growth (apiece) left in them. Buy! Buy! Buy! (Not investment advice.)

The UK and India markets also drove strong sales, with stalker series Baby Reindeer garnering 88.4 million views, while India ranked third in revenue percent growth due to Netflix's most popular Indian drama series to date, Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, with 15 million views.\n\nIn the latest quarter, the company grew its subscriber base by 8 million total new accounts -- almost double the 4.9 million analysts expected. That number was slightly lower than the 9.5 million in new users Netflix added in the first quarter. But the dip was expected, after executives informed investors they didn't expect to replicate that number in the second quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, quarterly revenue came in 17% higher than last year at $9.5 billion, while earnings per share were $4.88 compared to an expected $4.73. Compared to the same quarter last year, net profits rose 44% to $2.15 billion.\n\nAfter being widely considered the winner of the streaming wars, there were some questions as to what extent Netflix's industry dominance would continue. Instead, it has impressed investors with another quarter that highlighted its ability to add new subscribers in a saturated market, while growing revenues and expanding margins. Netflix reported 27% margins for the quarter, a five percentage point increase compared to the second quarter of 2023. On Thursday's earnings call, Netflix executives said the company expected margins to grow for the foreseeable future.\n\nThey \"could bounce around each year...but we're committed to growing margins each year,\" Netflix CFO Spencer Neuman said on the call.\n\nCritical to Netflix's success has been its crackdown on password sharing, which resulted in millions of new subscribers. The initiative is expected to remain an ongoing part of Netflix's business that will continue to generate new subscribers and subsequently new revenue, according to co-CEO Greg Peters.\n\nNetflix also drove significant numbers of new subscribers through its ad-supported tier, first launched in 2022. In the second quarter, subscriptions to the ad-supported tier grew 34%. As of May the company said it had 40 million subscribers in its ad-tier. And analysts believe there's still room to grow for that part of Netflix's business.\n\n\"We continue to view advertising as a longer term story and do not expect a material revenue contribution until 2025, especially given the glut of new inventory coming to market,\" wrote Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich in a note published ahead of the earnings release.\n\nShortly before the earnings call Netflix's advertising business underwent a management shakeup, with its former vice president of ad sales, Peter Naylor, leaving the company. The news was unexpected given Netflix, like all other media companies, is in the midst of a major sales push with advertisers, as they decided where to spend next year's budgets.\n\nWhile still a relatively small portion of Netflix's subscriber base, the ad-supported tier does have similar levels of engagement, with an average of two hours per day per user, Peters said.\n\nThe company's growth efforts also extend to its content strategy. Since the start of the year Netflix has made its foray into live programming. When asked if live entertainment went hand-in-hand with its efforts to grow its advertising business, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos replied: \"We're in live because our members love it, and it drives a ton of engagement and a ton of excitement.\"\n\nIn January Netflix reached a 10-year, $5 billion agreement to broadcast World Wrestling Entertainment, the company's first live sports deal. A few months later, Netflix secured an even more valuable piece of the sports market when it bought the rights to air two NFL games on Christmas Day from 2024 to 2026. The NFL agreement in particular represents a coup in live entertainment for Netflix. Professional football broadcasts accounted for 93 of the top 100 live programs in 2023, according to Sportico.\n\nThe streamer also tried its hand at live content other than sports, launching comedy shows with John Mulaney and Katt Williams. In May, Netflix hit a major homerun with the Brady roast, in which comedians pelted the legendary quarterback with insults The three-hour broadcast climbed to number one in the ratings of streaming programs the week of its release, according to Nielsen data.\n\nTo fund its ever growing assortment of shows and movies, Netflix expects to spend $17 billion in 2024 on content. The majority of the budget will be for original content, though spending on sports licensing fees will increase given their new focus in Netflix's strategy. Overall though the company seemed pleased with the return on that investment, especially given the struggles of some of its fellow streamers.\n\n\"The challenge for so many of our competitors is that while they are investing heavily in premium content, it's generating relatively small viewing on their streaming services,\" the company said in an earnings release.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The plan limits users to 720p resolution and one device and lets people download content. Netflix stopped offering the Basic plan to new subscribers in January. In June, Netflix started booting subscribers in the UK and Canada off the plan and automatically put them onto a cheaper subscription plan with ads.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders today [PDF], Netflix confirmed publicly for the first time that it \"will now start\" to phase out the ad-free Basic plan in the US and France. This will make the cheapest commercial-free Netflix plan $15.49/month in the US. That Standard plan supports up to two devices, downloads, and 1080p resolution.\n\nNetflix thinks killing the Basic plan will help it gain more subscribers who watch commercials, which, on average, generates more revenue for the company.\n\nAs expected from a streaming company these days, Netflix touted its ad tier to shareholders, noting that the $7 tier now represents \"over 45 percent\" of new sign-ups in areas where it's sold. Per Netflix's letter, ads will only be an increasingly larger part of its strategy, as Netflix aims to \"achieve critical ad subscriber scale for advertisers in our ad countries in 2025, creating a strong base from which we can further increase our ad membership in 2026 and beyond.\"\n\nThe news comes as streamers grapple with increasing streaming subscription costs. Netflix most recently hiked pricing in October. In January, the company suggested to shareholders that more price hikes were possible, saying that it would \"occasionally ask our members to pay a little extra to reflect\" platform improvements.\n\nNot cozying up with competition\n\nIf today's news makes you hope for a convenient streaming-only deal that lets you subscribe to Netflix and another video streaming service for cheaper, you're out of luck. Netflix today said it's not interested in streaming-only bundles.\n\nBundle deals, which combine streaming and other services for a cheaper subscription rate, have become the streaming industry's answer to high cancellation rates among subscribers, including those who quickly cancel and resubscribe depending on what's available to stream that month.\n\nIn its letter, Netflix noted that although cable or mobile providers or device-makers may offer deals combining Netflix and another streaming service, Netflix does not make deals that bundle it with another rival streamer, like Disney+ or Max. The company claimed that Netflix is already \"a go-to destination,\" which \"limits the benefit to Netflix of bundling directly with other streamers.\"\n\nThat means if you're hoping to save money on your Netflix subscription, which keeps getting more expensive, the only options are to watch Netflix with commercials or get a cable-reminiscent bundle that includes a different kind of service, like Comcast or Verizon Wireless.\n\nWe know which option Netflix would like you to pick.

"body": "The world's leading streaming video service said it ended the April-to-June period with a total of 277.7 million subscribers - Copyright AFP/File Lionel BONAVENTURE\n\nNetflix on Thursday said it added eight million new subscribers in the second quarter, as the home of hit shows \"The Crown\" and \"Bridgerton\" posted its latest financial earnings that exceeded analyst expectations.\n\nThe world's leading streaming video service said it ended the April-to-June period with a total of 277.7 million subscribers, as net profit dipped to $2.1 billion, but revenue surged to $9.6 billion.\n\nThe latest numbers rewarded Netflix's moves to boost revenue after a rough patch in 2022.\n\nIn a bid to boost sputtering growth, the company launched an ad-subsidized offering last year around the same time as a crackdown on sharing passwords.\n\nAs part of that effort, Netflix also got rid of its cheapest commercial-free plan in the UK and Canada, with expectations of further expansions.\n\nIn the United States, the company is also beginning to offer some users combined packages with its one-time rivals, making itself available through joint subscriptions with Peacock and Apple TV.\n\nNetflix in May said its ad-supported tier reached 40 million monthly active users across the globe and accounted for 40 percent of all sign-ups in the countries where it was available, up from 23 million in January.\n\nThe company also launched an in-house advertising platform so that brands can better optimize its customer data, no longer partnering with Microsoft for that technology.\n\nInvestors have cheered on the moves, with Netflix shares gaining 38 percent since the beginning of the year -- though it has warned that growth in overall subscribers could slow throughout the course of the year.\n\nA renewed warning on Thursday that the results could be lower than expected in the current quarter sent Netflix shares lower in after hours trading.\n\nStill, Netflix is seen as reigning supreme over the video content market, with Disney+ still struggling nearly five years after a launch that featured a slew of new content from its blockbuster Marvel and Star Wars universes.\n\nNetflix earned an industry-leading 107 nominations for the Emmys earlier this week, with 11 nods for its surprise hit, the black comedy \"Baby Reindeer.\"\n\nAfter the successful new season of \"Bridgerton\" earlier this year, upcoming shows include the eagerly awaited second season of \"Squid Game.\"\n\nThe dystopian Korean horror tale about a fictional, deadly game show remains by far the most-watched Netflix TV series ever.\n\nAnalysts warned however that competition, at some point, could figure out how to challenge Netflix.\n\n\"The competition is starting to catch up to Netflix as the company's market dominance shows signs of waning,\" said Mike Proulx, vice-president at Forrester.\n\nHe noted a survey that showed the amount of monthly US users streaming from the platform had dipped, with the rivals seeing growth.\n\n\"This makes it all the more critical for Netflix to continue to double down on its ads business as a means to diversify and grow revenue,\" he added.\n\nNetflix is also branching out into live entertainment and in the United States, with plans to broadcast two National Football League games for the first time.",

Revenue for the quarter reached $9.56 billion, in line with estimates.\n\nWall Street investors have been monitoring the growth of Neflix's ad-supported tier, which has been fueled by the company's crackdown on password-sharing, pricing increases for ad-free tiers and new consumer bundles, such as Comcast's \"StreamSaver\" bundle, which combines Netflix with Peacock and Apple TV+.\n\nNetflix said its ad tier membership grew 34% from the prior quarter, but it did not say how many subscribers chose that option.\n\n\"Our ad business is growing nicely and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to our business,\" Netflix said in its letter to investors. \"But building a business from scratch takes time - and coupled with the large size of our subscription revenue - we don't expect advertising to be a primary driver of our revenue growth in 2024 or 2025.\"\n\nThe company said it expects third-quarter revenue growth of 14%, compared with a year ago.\n\nThree years into its videogame initiative, Netflix said it planned to release a multiplayer game based on \"Squid Game\" later this year when it debuts Season Two of the dystopian Korean series.

to $9.6-billion.\n\nThe latest numbers rewarded Netflix's moves to boost revenue after a rough patch in 2022.\n\nIn a bid to boost sputtering growth, the company launched an ad-subsidized offering last year around the same time as a crackdown on sharing passwords.\n\nAs part of that effort, Netflix also got rid of its cheapest commercial-free plan in the UK and Canada, with expectations of further expansions.\n\nIn the United States, the company is also beginning to offer some users combined packages with its one-time rivals, making itself available through joint subscriptions with Peacock and Apple TV.\n\nNetflix in May said its ad-supported tier reached 40 million monthly active users across the globe and accounted for 40 percent of all sign-ups in the countries where it was available, up from 23 million in January.\n\nThe company also launched an in-house advertising platform so that brands can better optimize its customer data, no longer partnering with Microsoft for that technology.\n\nInvestors have cheered on the moves, with Netflix shares gaining 38 percent since the beginning of the year -- though it has warned that growth in overall subscribers could slow

viewership, Netflix also scored big with \"Under Paris,\" a shark horror movie from France that the company said had reached 91 million views.\n\nThe third season of \"Bridgerton\" scored 98.5 million

It's looking to wring more cash from its lower-priced plans, which show ads within its streaming content.\n\nNetflix in fact told investors in May that its ad-supported tier, which costs around $6.99 a month, topped 40 million active users that month, up from just 5 million over the year-earlier month.\n\nStill, Wall Street at present remains focused on subscriber additions. Analysts expect Netflix brought in a net 4.82 million new users over the three months ended in June, a tally that would be the smallest in more than a year.\n\nNetflix pushing into live events\n\nThat's still likely to help drive revenue 16% above the year-earlier quarter, however, to around $9.5 billion. Analysts also say the figure could rise as high as $9.8 billion over the three months ending in September as the group mulls new price increases to match recent moves by its competitors.\n\n\"In our view, recent price increases by competitors and ongoing low rates of churn support Netflix price increases over coming quarters,\" said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Justin Patterson, who recently lifted his Netflix price target by $22 to $735 a share. (Churn is the measure of subscribers switching to rival services.)\n\nRelated: Analysts rewire Netflix stock price target ahead of earnings\n\n\"As pricing returns to a more normal cadence, we believe Netflix has ample room to sustain more than 10% annual revenue growth with 2% to 3% annual operating-margin expansion,\" he added.\n\nNetflix is also looking to beef up its offerings of live programming, which are crucial to the growth of advertising-based video on demand. These include the addition of two National Football League games on Christmas Day and next year's launch of WWE \"Raw\" wrestling events.\n\nIn January Netflix agreed to pay TKO Group Holdings $5 billion for the streaming rights to \"Raw,\" the WWE's flagship weekly wrestling program. Streaming is slated to start in 2025.\n\nEmmy haul\n\n\"Netflix's still limited foray into live major sports with Christmas NFL games complementing scripted WWE content and successful behind the scenes efforts including Drive to Survive and Break Point reinforces a view that streaming bundles will increasingly emulate the traditional linear bundle,\" said Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan.\n\nOriginal content has also been increasingly important for Netflix, although its recent slate has been helped by shows that it licenses from mainstream networks as well.\n\nRelated: Analyst reboots Trade Desk stock price target after Netflix deal\n\nLast summer's strikes by both the the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild hit Netflix hard, ultimately reducing its overall offering of TV and movie titles by around 15%, following at least a decade of increases. Netflix now looks to be focusing on quality over quantity.\n\nMore Tech Stocks:\n\nAnalyst revisits Nvidia stock price target after Blackwell checksCathie Wood unloads shares of rebounding tech titanBig tech company files Chapter 7 bankruptcy, closes abruptly\n\nNetflix earned a total of 107 Emmy nominations this year for titles including \"The Crown,\" \"The Bear\" and the controversial series \"Baby Reindeer.\" Winners are slated to be announced Sept. 15.\n\nNetflix shares were marked 0.36% higher in premarket trading to indicate an opening bell price of $649.82 each. That move would extend the stock's year-to-gain to around 33.5% and put it within touching distance of the all-time peak of $697.49 it reached earlier this month.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager sees world of pain coming for stocks", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_baccardax@postandcourier.com", "name": "Martin Baccardax", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(radio_network)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital (radio network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "House show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bear (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship_(broadcasting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flagship (broadcasting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Crown (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_7,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Writers Guild of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screen Actors Guild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (professional wrestling)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-15", "textStart": 3818, "textEnd": 3826}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Netflix's stock has been boosted in recent quarters by its push to gain subscribers on its cheaper, ad-supported tier, in addition to its crackdown on password sharing.\n\nRevenue came in at $US9.56 billion ($14.25b), up 17 per cent compared to the year-earlier period, driven primarily by the increase in average paid memberships.\n\nNetflix said it now expects full-year reported revenue growth of 14 per cent to 15 per cent, compared with previous guidance of 13 per cent to 15 per cent.\n\nThe company reported net income of $US2.15b, up from $US1.49b during the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNetflix's global paid memberships rose 16.5 per cent year-on-year to 278 million. This marks one of the last updates Netflix will release regarding its membership numbers.\n\nLast quarter, the company warned investors it would stop providing quarterly membership numbers or average revenue per user beginning in 2025, noting the company is \"focused on revenue and operating margin as our primary financial metrics -- and engagement (i.e. time spent) as our best proxy for customer satisfaction\".\n\nNetflix began focusing on different business strategies to drive revenue growth after the streamer saw subscriber growth slow in 2022. In May, Netflix said it would launch its own ad platform and no longer partner with Microsoft for that technology.\n\nThe company also has begun adding live sports, such as NFL games on Christmas Day over the next three years, a move that will likely attract more ad dollars for the streamer.\n\n\"We're in live [TV] because our members love it, and it drives a ton of engagement and a ton of excitement ... and the good thing is advertisers like it for the exact same reason,\" said Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos on Thursday's earnings call.\n\nNetflix had been dipping its toe into live content even before its deal with the NFL, with Sarandos noting the company's focus on \"buzzy, exclusive live entertainment\".\n\nStill, original shows like Bridgerton and Baby Reindeer continue to drive engagement for the streamer.\n\nThe company said its cheaper, ad-supported tier has been gaining traction among its base, with these subscribers accounting for more than 45 per cent of sign-ups in the markets where the option is offered.\n\nHowever, Netflix noted that the ad-supported business is still young, and it doesn't expect ad revenue to be a \"primary driver of our revenue growth in 2024 or 2025\".\n\n\"The near term challenge (and medium term opportunity) is that we're scaling faster than our ability to monetise our growing ad inventory,\" the company said in its earnings release, meaning the streamer isn't able to meet advertiser demand yet.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Greg Peters said on the earnings call that Netflix has so far been focused on scaling its ad-supported subscriber base. With the company on track to achieve its subscriber goals for 2025, Netflix is now shifting its focus to monetising its ad inventory, he said.\n\nAs the company beefs up its advertising operation, it's giving \"advertisers more effective ways to buy ... a big point of feedback we heard from advertisers,\" Peters said.\n\nOn this note, Netflix added it believes it's on track to \"achieve critical ad subscriber scale for our advertisers\" next year, allowing it to further increase its ad-tier memberships in 2026 and beyond.\n\nCNBC\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The West Australian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proxy server"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_satisfaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer satisfaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Sarandos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Sarandos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media (communication)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-15404898/4a28c09257c72b6f2a1f6e6c51b4050ba99aae18-16x9-x103y65w2951h1660.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Netflix already phased out the basic plan in the U.K. and Canada, which Netflix said contributed to a 34% sequential jump in memberships with ads in the second quarter.\n\nThe streaming giant also said that integrating ads into its offerings allows it to offer lower prices to users and creates an additional source of revenue for the company.\n\nNetflix CEO Spencer Neumann said the \"attractive entry point in terms of price point and feature set for our ads plan\" could help support Netflix's subscriber growth.\n\nNetflix added more than 8 million paying subscribers in the second quarter, reporting a total of 277.65 million global streaming paid memberships, better than analysts' expectations.\n\nNeuman said the subscriber growth was driven by Netflix's content slate with a \"wide variety of titles that delivered across genres and regions.\"\n\nNetflix highlighted content that performed well in the quarter, including its original shows like \"Bridgerton,\" and \"Baby Reindeer,\" as well as \"The Roast of Tom Brady,\" which the company said attracted its largest live audience to date. The streaming giant has also recently pushed into live sports and related content to better position itself against competitors.\n\nThe company has long reported quarterly subscriber numbers as a metric of business performance, but will stop doing so in 2025 as it says revenue and operating margin are better financial metrics, while engagement or watch hours better reflect customer satisfaction.\n\nNetflix said it expects $9.73 billion in revenue for the third quarter, slightly lower than analyst projections compiled by Visible Alpha.\n\nDuring the earning call, co-CEO Theodore A. Sarandos noted that the company expects \"some headwinds\" in engagement due to the continued effects of its password-sharing crackdown and competition from Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube.\n\nCompany leaders said the advertising business is an opportunity for \"a multi-year trajectory to have a big and increasing revenue and profit impact on the business.\"\n\nNetflix shares were 0.8% lower at $638.12 as of 12:45 p.m. ET Friday, though they've gained over 30% since the start of the year.", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investopedia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metric system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/Ls-fz6XEgjDhtKthf14ZpGM-ZSs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1958956269-d7101ee9ea1e4bac82887d85d4af9826.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The new sign-ups brought the total number of global Netflix subscribers to more than 277 million.\n\nThe company reported diluted per-share earnings of $4.88, compared with consensus forecasts of $4.74 a share, according to LSEG. Revenue for the quarter reached $9.56 billion, in line with estimates.\n\nWall Street investors have been monitoring the growth of Neflix's ad-supported tier, which has been fueled by the company's crackdown on password-sharing, pricing increases for ad-free tiers and new consumer bundles, such as Comcast's \"StreamSaver\" bundle, which combines Netflix with Peacock and Apple TV+.\n\nNetflix said its ad tier membership grew 34% from the prior quarter, but it did not say how many subscribers chose that option.\n\n\"Our ad business is growing nicely and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to our business,\" Netflix said in its letter to investors. \"But building a business from scratch takes time - and coupled with the large size of our subscription revenue - we don't expect advertising to be a primary driver of our revenue growth in 2024 or 2025.\"\n\nThe company said it expects third-quarter revenue growth of 14%, compared with a year ago. It cautioned that subscriber gains would be lower than the comparable period in 2023, which was the first full quarter to benefit from Netflix's crackdown on password-sharing.\n\nThree years into its videogame initiative, Netflix said it planned to release a multiplayer game based on \"Squid Game\" later this year when it debuts Season Two of the dystopian Korean series.

And that's not a statistical anomaly for Q2 -- the number is steady with what the bank found in Q1 2024. It had been half that, 2 percent, at the end of 2023.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nOf the 1,000 respondents, 57 percent said they currently subscribe to Netflix, down from the 60 percent who did in the prior quarter. In the second quarter of 2023, 69 percent had said they were current Netflix subscribers. Wedbush's relatively small sample size may provide imperfect statistics; Netflix's reported UCAN (U.S. and Canada) subscriber numbers have steadily grown amid its password-sharing crackdown. Wall Street expects 1.1 million paid net additions from the region to be reported on Thursday when Netflix unveils its second-quarter earnings.\n\nSeven percent of the survey respondents said they've canceled Netflix within the past three months, which is reasonably steady compared to previous quarters. An eye-opening 14 percent of respondents said they had heard of Netflix but \"never subscribed to\" it.\n\nCome on. At the end of March, Netflix had about 83 million paying members in the U.S. and Canada (Netflix does not separate the two in its reporting). In other words, who in 2024 America has not heard of Netflix? Furthermore, who has not heard of the streaming video titan but is taking an online survey?\n\nThe Wedbush survey, like any worth its salt, is weighted across demographics as informed by U.S. Census data. Unless a few dozen grownups get their kicks out of messing with Wedbush each quarter, the answer to our question is, well, them. If we were to guess (and it's only a guess), it is likely to be elderly Americans, possibly living under a rock (but, again, with internet access), who say they have \"never heard of\" Netflix.\n\nWe're sure Netflix, with its 270 million global paid subscribers (and growing! Wall Street forecasts that number will climb past 275 million with Thursday's update), isn't too worried about the survey results. If anything, Netflix executives would be comforted by the bank's bullish $725 price target from the same note to clients (obtained by IndieWire).

Wall Street as a whole predicted the streamer would add 4.8 million subs in Q2; well, (almost) double that.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nThe beat nearly mirrored Netflix's overachievement from the first quarter. Netflix added 9.33 million subs in Q1, blowing away Wall Street's forecast of 4.9 million.\n\nEnjoy these quarterly subscriber updates while you can: Netflix has said it will stop sharing those numbers regularly come 2025. For now, all Netflix said about the current summer quarter's net adds is that they are expected to be \"lower\" than last year's 8.76 million additions in the same period.\n\nNetflix posted Q2 earnings per share (EPS) of $4.88 on $9.559 billion in revenue, which also topped forecasts. Wall Street expected EPS of $4.74 on $9.53 billion in revenue. Its net income, or profit, was $2.147 billion, lower than the prior quarter.\n\nExecutives have stated that revenue is Netflix's key metric, replacing subscriber count. The streamer has attacked the KPI through its password-sharing crackdown and the addition of advertising. That first initiative has been a huge hit -- the second one has a ways to go. The elimination of Netflix's lowest-priced ad-free tier, which the company confirmed today is happening in the U.S., should help jumpstart signups to its ad-supported plan. Netflix said its ad-tier signups grew by 34 percent from Q1 to Q2.\n\nNetflix's highlights in the quarter included \"Baby Reindeer,\" its Tom Brady Roast, and \"Bridgerton\" Season 3, which is already on the streamer's all-time Top 10 -- and rising.

The company said the new platform will boost its ad-supported streaming business by giving advertisers new insights, new ways to buy and new ways to measure the impact of a certain campaign.\n\nHowever, some will remain sceptical about the success of its advertising efforts to date, and news of the departure of its VP of global advertising sales, Peter Naylor, will do little to silence those critics.\n\nFor its part, Netflix says it is \"confident\" that advertising will be a \"key component of [its] longer-term revenue and profit growth.\"\n\nIn its letter to shareholders, Netflix was keen to emphasise the advantage it has built in streaming - and take some shots at its traditional SVoD rivals.\n\n\"Netflix generated more view hours in the Nielsen top 10 across film, series and licensed titles than all the other streamers combined,\" it said, citing data from Nielsen's most recent streaming report and calling itself and YouTube the \"clear leaders in direct-to-consumer entertainment.\"\n\nAccording to Nielsen, Netflix accounted for 8.4% of all streaming in the US in June, second only to YouTube with 9.9%. The rest of the field lags far behind, including Prime Video (3.1%), Hulu (3%), Disney+ (2%), Tubi (2%), The Roku Channel (1.5%), Max (1.4%), Peacock (1.2%), Paramount+ (1.1%) and Pluto TV (0.8%).\n\n\"The challenge for so many of our competitors is that while they are investing heavily in premium content, it's generating relatively small viewing on their streaming services and linear continues to decline,\" said Netflix.\n\nThe streamer also addressed a frequently made argument that it commissions too much content and would benefit from taking a more curated approach to its content offering.\n\n\"Commentators often ask if Netflix needs so many shows and films, and the answer is an emphatic yes. With 278 million member households - and more than two people per household on average - we're programming for an audience of over 600 million. It's a huge number and to delight this many people, we need lots of great stories that appeal to many different tastes and moods. It's why we continue to increase the investment in our programming, even as many of our competitors are pulling back,\" the letter added.\n\nStrong-performing titles in the second quarter included the third season of Bridgerton, UK hit Baby Reindeer, The Great Indian Kapil Show and live special The Roast of Tom Brady, which Netflix says drew its largest live audience yet.", "source": {"uri": "c21media.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "C21Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Roku_Channel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Roku Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tubi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pluto TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.c21media.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bridgerton-s3-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

But I think all of this optimism that we're seeing kind of heading into the second quarter earnings is actually off of subscriber numbers.\"\n\nShe notes that in the first quarter of 2024, Netflix reported 9.3 million new subscriber adds, and it is likely to top the expected 4.7 million in its second quarter.\n\nWhile Netflix's advertising growth has been slower than expected, Ranganathan points to several new opportunities that are appealing to advertisers, from its deal with WWE to the Christmas Day NFL games. She expects these deals to be \"a big bump for their ad business\" as the streaming competition heats up.\n\nRanganathan believes that \"at this point, it's safe to say that Netflix has pretty much won the streaming wars,\" citing the 2 billion viewers reached every day and its broad catalog of content offerings.\"The one metric that we really look at when it comes to Netflix and when it comes to all streaming players is engagement. And engagement is very, very high for Netflix. It's higher than almost all of its other competitors.\"\n\nAs Netflix continues facing high expectations, Ranganathan adds, \"I think Netflix is in the best position that it's ever been competitively, and also financially as well as fundamentally. So they're really firing here on all cylinders.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.\n\nThis post was written by Melanie Riehl\n\nNetflix is set to report results Thursday after the close and Wall Street's expectations are high analysts at Bank of America Morgan Stanley Moffet Nathanson.\n\nThey've all raised their price targets on the streaming giant just yesterday ahead of the print.\n\nJoining us now is Geeta Ragan or Bloomberg Intelligence, senior media analyst to talk to us about what to expect from Netflix and um get that those shares have been performing well.\n\nThey're about 35% this year.\n\nSo there is that optimism going into the print, what numbers are you watching most closely?\n\nAnd do you think Netflix is going to meet those high expectations?\n\nYeah, expectations definitely very, very high Julie.\n\nAnd I think what is really ironic though is, you know, they are actually trying to move away from subscriber numbers.\n\nThey, they said that they're gonna stop disclosing subscriber metrics altogether starting in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nBut I think all of this optimism that we're seeing kind of heading into the second quarter earnings is actually off of subscriber numbers.\n\nSo we know that they reported really high subscriber growth in the first quarter, 9.3 million new subscriber ads.\n\nAnd while the consensus for the second quarter is around 4.7 million, I think the street very much expects something much, much higher, maybe something to the tune of 6 to 7 million.\n\nAnd I think what's gonna be even more interesting is if we see 2024 actually come out as one of the record years for net uh new subscriber ads for Netflix II, I think right now, the way that they're going, they could very well report close to almost 30 million new subscriber gains just in 2024 which will be their one of their highest ever outside of, of course COVID and G. There's also gonna be a lot of focus, of course, on the ad tier.\n\nWhat do you expect we're gonna hear from there.\n\nYeah, so so far, you know, it looks like the momentum with advertising.\n\nOf course, it's, it's kind of been a little bit slower than what we'd anticipated.\n\nSo one of the numbers that they did disclose Josh at their upfront was which was held in May was that they have about 40 million uh active users, monthly, active users.\n\nWe don't know exactly how many subscribers they have because they haven't disclosed that publicly.\n\nBut we estimate that it's close to about 20 million subscribers.\n\nBut again, what they're doing right now is while they haven't actually given us an ad number in terms of the amount of revenue that it is generating, they are introducing a lot of programming that is kind of going to be very, very uh appealing to advertisers.\n\nSo, uh you know, some of the deals that they've done include uh WWE which they're going to start streaming starting in 2025.\n\nBut much more important than that is the two NFL games that they're gonna have on Christmas Day, which is going to be super, super appealing to, to advertisers and, and we think it's going to be a big bump for their ad business.\n\nThe um Nielsen was just out with its monthly numbers on, on streaming traffic.\n\nAnd I thought that some of the stuff was really interesting here.\n\nNetflix saw the biggest increase in market share, but it's still overall share in June was lower than that of youtube, which we don't tend to talk as much about because it's not a pure play.\n\nBut I'm curious how you're thinking about competition um for Netflix or sort of where it, its weaknesses are at this point.\n\nSo in terms of that, that's a great point, Julie.\n\nSo I think in terms of streaming competition, uh I, I think at this point it's safe to say that Netflix has pretty much won the streaming wars.\n\nOf course, we talk about youtube, but that's a little bit of a different animal.\n\nI mean, that's a lot of user generated content and it's going to kind of be hard to get, you know, the level of eyeballs, obviously, they have 2 billion uh viewers that they reach every day.\n\nSo it's, it's on, it's on a completely different scale.\n\nBut I think what's really positive for Netflix is that they still have only less than 10% of total TV viewing time.\n\nAnd if you kind of just look at their catalog, uh it has really, really broad appeal.\n\nUh and the one metric that we really look at when, when, when it comes to Netflix and when it comes to all streaming players is engagement and engagement is very, very high for Netflix, it's higher than almost all of its other competitors.\n\nWe're seeing 2, 2.5 hours spent on average per day by a user and, and we've seen that across the board.\n\nUh you know, even if you look at some of their biggest performing titles in two Q, you know, you look at Bridgerton about 1 billion hours streamed of just that one title alone in toy.\n\nSo we're seeing engagement numbers that are extremely strong.\n\nSo, so when we kind of think about the competitive landscape, I think Netflix is in the best position that it's ever been competitively and also financially as well as fundamentally.\n\nI know that's a bet some, some analysts on the street are making it, it, you know, they haven't raised prices, Josh for about two years now in the US on their standard tier, it's been stuck at about $15.5.\n\nSo it, they're absolutely due for a price increase.\n\nThe reason they didn't do that is because they were introducing two new initiatives.\n\nSo they obviously didn't want to rock the boat then.\n\nBut, you know, all of their competitors have raised prices.\n\nWe definitely think they will raise prices a little bit later this year.\n\nAll right, Netflix earnings Thursday, we'll be watching.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The less-costly plan accounted for almost half of sign-ups last quarter in markets where it's offered, and the company said it will be large enough next year to appeal to major sponsors.\n\nThis quarter, Netflix expects to deliver earnings of $5.10 a share, higher than Wall Street estimates, on sales of $9.73 billion, which is slightly less than analysts forecast. The company said subscriber gains will trail last year's 8.76 million. Analysts predict 5.18 million.\n\nNetflix's surge in growth has occurred while most of its competitors have slowed down, struggling to attract customers and pay for new shows.\n\nThe company delivered a number of major hits last quarter, including a new season of Bridgerton, the surprise hit Baby Reindeer and the French movie Under Paris. They helped boost Netflix's share of total TV viewing in the US climbed to more than 8% in the most recent month, more than double any other paid streaming service, according to Nielsen data.\n\n\"The challenge for so many of our competitors is that while they are investing heavily in premium content, it's generating relatively small viewing on their streaming services,\" the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders.\n\nFor the second quarter, Netflix said, earnings rose 48% to $4.88 a share, beating estimates of $4.74. Revenue increased 17% to $9.56 billion, slightly exceeding projections. It ended the quarter with 277.7 million customers worldwide.\n\nNetflix shares were up less than 1% to $645.14 on Friday morning in New York. They fell initially after the results were announced before recovering. Bullish investors have been pushing the stock back toward the all-time closing high of more than $690 that they reached in November 2021.\n\nRead More: Netflix Bulls Bet On 'Bridgerton' Keeping Subscriber Gains Going\n\nNetflix plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers next year, which many analysts interpreted as a bad sign about its growth going forward. Yet the company, which has added more than 17 million customers this year, struck a confident tone Thursday, raising its full-year estimate for profit margins.\n\nIn a video interview following the results, management said there are still 500 million homes with smart TVs that don't pay for Netflix, a large addressable market. Netflix can also gain a larger share of TV viewing in the US and other markets.\n\nThe most immediate opportunity for Netflix is in advertising. More than 40 million people now use the company's advertising plan every month. Management expects to achieve a meaningful number of subscribers for its advertising tier by next year, but needs to do more work to make money from those customers.\n\n\"The near-term challenge (and medium term opportunity) is that we're scaling faster than our ability to monetize our growing ad inventory,\" the company said.\n\nManagement is also increasing the company's investment in video games, with plans to release one new title every month.

This could be led by third-party data showing strong second-quarter subscriber figures, greater appreciation for Netflix's market position and scale, and optimism around the company's ad-supported plan.\n\n\"We anticipate a significant advertising ramp in '25 and '26,\" she added.\n\nEhrlich says an ad-supported plan could get increased optimism thanks to live sports and sports adjacent programming like NFL games on Christmas Day.\n\n\"Overall, these dynamics support our bullish thesis for longer-term potential which we expect will be driven by healthy revenue growth, continued margin expansion and outsized growth over the next several years.\"\n\nNetflix reported 40 million monthly active users for its ad-supported tier in May.

However, the correlation between subscriber growth and revenue growth has been weak, as evidenced last year when a record increase in subscribers did not translate to proportionate revenue growth.\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of advertising is expected to dilute pricing leverage, and the potential normalization of subscriber growth following the paid sharing initiative could pose challenges to achieving the projected revenue targets.\n\nThe possibility of Netflix eliminating the basic tier in the U.S. and other markets, pushing users towards higher-priced or ad-supported plans, mirrors experiments currently conducted in the UK and Canada. This strategy change, however, may not be seamless, as seen by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s recent experience with a similar move resulting in immediate engagement drops.\n\nBarclays also notes that Netflix is in the nascent stages of its sports content investments, which are set to significantly increase globally in the coming years. This, along with the development of in-house advertising technology, may lead to a decelerated pace of margin expansion next year.\n\nDespite these challenges, Netflix's exceptional execution makes it difficult to take a negative position on the company. Yet, as Netflix's business model begins to resemble that of a typical media company, Barclays suggests some risk mitigation in the stock ahead of the earnings report.\n\nIn other recent news, Netflix has seen a flurry of activity from analysts. Benchmark raised the price target for Netflix to $545 while maintaining a Sell rating, citing an increase in the assumed normalized price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nIn contrast, BofA Securities, Argus, and Loop Capital have raised their price targets for Netflix to $740, $767, and $750 respectively, citing strong subscriber growth trends and potential revenue boosts from strategic initiatives such as live sports programming and an advertising-supported video on demand (AVOD) service.\n\nMeanwhile, Citi and Piper Sandler maintained neutral stances on Netflix with price targets of $660 and $600 respectively, closely observing potential subscriber growth and revenue trends. Additionally, another Wall Street firm raised Netflix's price target to $775, up from $725, based on anticipated subscriber growth and revenue from the AVOD service.\n\nNetflix's expansion into live sports programming, notably its NFL deal, and the addition of an ad-supported subscription tier have been highlighted as strategic moves. Furthermore, a tentative three-year agreement between the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which includes significant pay increases and terms regulating AI use in the industry, impacts Netflix among other industry players. These are among the recent developments for Netflix.\n\nAs Netflix approaches its second-quarter earnings report, investors are closely monitoring its performance metrics. According to InvestingPro data, Netflix's market capitalization stands at a robust $282.69 billion.\n\nThe company's P/E ratio, a measure of its current share price relative to its per-share earnings, is 44.65, with a slight adjustment to 43.9 when considering the last twelve months as of Q1 2024. This is in line with the company's growth, as Netflix's revenue has grown by 9.47% over the last twelve months, with a notable quarterly increase of 14.81% in Q1 2024.\n\nOne of the InvestingPro Tips suggests that Netflix is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, which may indicate that the stock is undervalued given its earnings prospects.

Netflix also reported a net income of $2.147 billion, a number that's up 44% year-over-year.\n\nIn Q2, Netflix gained 8 million new subscribers and now has a total of 277.65 million subscribers around the world (up 16.5% year-over-year). In a letter to shareholders, the company explained that its $6.99/month ad-supported tier now accounted for over 45% of all signups in markets where it's available.

With 22.6 million views since its release on May, 5, the celebrity roast special The Roast of Tom Brady also gave Netflix its \"largest live audience yet.\" Going forward, the streaming platform will continue to invest in eventized programming, and it's hoping to capitalize on upcoming events like the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson boxing match, as as well as weekly WWE programming starting in 2025.\n\nNetflix will also continue to grow its games offering with new games based on Netflix exclusive shows.

A video interview with Netflix executives, including co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, will follow at 4:45 pm ET. What to watch:\n\nSUBSCRIBERS: Netflix's membership trends are a closely-watched measure of the company's growth trajectory.\n\nIn the first quarter, the company reported the net addition of 9.33M global streaming paid members, noting that the paid net additions were higher than the company had forecast.\n\nNetflix said in its quarterly letter to investors: \"For Q2'24, we forecast revenue growth of 16%. This equates to 21% growth on a F/X neutral basis due primarily to price changes in Argentina and the devaluation of the local currency relative to the US dollar. We expect paid net additions to be lower in Q2'24 vs. Q1'24 due to typical seasonality.\"\n\nNetflix is projected to add 4.87M net subscribers in the second quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Consensus forecasts reported by Bloomberg recently called for $9.53B in revenue and $4.76 in adjusted earnings per share for the June-end quarter, versus the company's forecast for Q2 revenue of $9.49B and EPS of $4.68.\n\nWHICH FIRM WAS RIGHT WITH POST-Q1 CALL?: On the day after Netflix's last earnings report, Canaccord downgraded Netflix to Hold from Buy with a price target of $585, down from $720. While Netflix reported Q1 results that were ahead of expectations, with revenue benefiting from another quarter of strong member additions as the company continues to scale its paid sharing offering, and profitability came in ahead of guidance, the firm said it saw limited growth catalysts for the next few quarters despite the \"mostly solid results and outlook.\" With the stock up 90% over the last 12 months at that time, the firm said it thought investors \"may be well served to look elsewhere for upside.\" Netflix's paid sharing likely meaningfully pulled forward member growth and reduced subscriber disclosures add to the uncertainty, contended Canaccord in its post-Q1 downgrade.\n\nMeanwhile, Needham upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold with a $700 price target following the company's Q1 earnings beat. Gen-AI will benefit \"tech-first\" companies the most, and Netflix qualifies, the analyst told investors at that time. The company also offers \"global scale\" that maximizes the value of its data, and Needham believes that its price increases and ad revenue should accelerate revenue growth and expand margins, the firm added.\n\nIn a recent preview note, Morgan Stanley raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $780 from $700 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The firm, which expects continued strong results from Netflix heading into the second half of 2024, raised estimates and sees a path to its $950 bull case now by year-end 2025, the analyst told investors. When looking toward 2025 growth, the firm expects advertising will increase in import to deliver on top-line and margin expansion expectations, the analyst noted.\n\nOn July 16, Jefferies raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $780 from $655 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The firm believes Netflix is well positioned for another subscriber beat in Q2, given the robust content slate and success of password sharing initiatives driving near-term upside. Looking ahead, the firm sees the second half content slate, including NFL Games and Squid Games, supporting growth and raised its FY24 subscriber estimate by 1.3M members.\n\nCITI, BENCHMARK REMAIN CAUTIOUS: On the day after Netflix's last earnings report, Citi noted that Netflix reported Q1 revenue 1% above the Street forecast and operating income that was 9% above the consensus. However, the company provided a 2024 revenue growth outlook range that, at the midpoint basis, fell below the Street view, the analyst told investors. Management also noted that they will no longer disclose net adds or average revenue per user beginning in Q1, Citi pointed out. The firm, which said it suspected that reduced disclosures may disappoint the Street, kept a Neutral rating on the shares.\n\nMore recently, on July 11, Citi said it is cautious on Netflix going into the Q2 report given the recent rally in the shares. The firm keeps a Neutral rating on the name with a $660 price target. Citi expects Netflix to report net additions modestly ahead of sell-side estimates, but modestly below investor expectations. Investor focus will likely remain on the company's advertising tier, sports content strategy and capital allocation, the analyst tells investors. With the stock up 45% year-to-date, Citi is cautious heading into the earnings report.\n\nIn its own earnings preview earlier this week, Benchmark raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $545 from $450 and kept a Sell rating on the shares. Netflix management \"undeniably continues to execute well\" on paid sharing, its advertising effort and injecting significant new content - including NFL Christmas Day games and WWE Raw next year - but the firm still does not feel the current valuation can be justified, even valuing Netflix as a Nasdaq 100 high growth technology name and \"disregarding its hybrid media stock character,\" the analyst told investors.", "source": {"uri": "thefly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thefly.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gary Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Sarandos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ted Sarandos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devaluation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devaluation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needham,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Needham, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Needham, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq-100", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq-100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(venture_capital_firm)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (venture capital firm)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Information", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://image.thefly.com/catalog/201901/img_243.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 114, "textEnd": 121}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 3093, "textEnd": 3100}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 4193, "textEnd": 4200}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Analysts expected a total of 4.87 million on average.\n\nThe company's crackdown on password sharing and the introduction of a lower-priced subscriber plan with advertising propelled Netflix to its second-best first half, trailing only the pandemic-fueled boom in 2020. The less-costly plan accounted for almost half of sign-ups last quarter in markets where it's offered, and the company said it will be large enough next year to appeal to major sponsors.\n\nThis quarter, Netflix expects to deliver earnings of $5.10 a share, higher than Wall Street estimates, on sales of $9.73 billion, which is slightly less than analysts forecast. The company said subscriber gains will trail last year's 8.76 million. Analysts predict 5.18 million.\n\nNetflix's surge in growth has occurred while most of its competitors have slowed down, struggling to attract customers and pay for new shows.\n\nThe company delivered a number of major hits last quarter, including a new season of Bridgerton, the surprise hit Baby Reindeer and the French movie Under Paris. They helped boost Netflix's share of total TV viewing in the US climbed to more than 8% in the most recent month, more than double any other paid streaming service, according to Nielsen data.\n\n\"The challenge for so many of our competitors is that while they are investing heavily in premium content, it's generating relatively small viewing on their streaming services,\" the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders.\n\nFor the second quarter, Netflix said, earnings rose 48% to $4.88 a share, beating estimates of $4.74. Revenue increased 17% to $9.56 billion, slightly exceeding projections. It ended the quarter with 277.7 million customers worldwide.\n\nShares of Netflix were little changed in extended trading. They fell initially after the results were announced before recovering. Bullish investors have been pushing the stock back toward the all-time closing high of more than $690 that they reached in November 2021.\n\nNetflix plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers next year, which many analysts interpreted as a bad sign about its growth going forward. Yet the company, which has added more than 17 million customers this year, struck a confident tone Thursday, raising its full-year estimate for profit margins.\n\nIn a video interview following the results, management said there are still 500 million homes with smart TVs that don't pay for Netflix, a large addressable market. Netflix can also gain a larger share of TV viewing in the US and other markets.\n\nThe most immediate opportunity for Netflix is in advertising. More than 40 million people now use the company's advertising plan every month. Management expects to achieve a meaningful number of subscribers for its advertising tier by next year, but needs to do more work to make money from those customers.\n\n\"The near-term challenge (and medium term opportunity) is that we're scaling faster than our ability to monetize our growing ad inventory,\" the company said.\n\nManagement is also increasing the company's investment in video games, with plans to release one new title every month. It will make a Squid Game-inspired video game later this year timed to the debut of the second season of that show.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Netflix's stock has been uplifted in recent quarters by its push to gain subscribers on its cheaper, ad-supported tier, in addition to its crackdown on password sharing.\n\nNetflix shares were down about 1.5% in extended trading following the earnings release.\n\nHere's how the company performed for the period ended June 30, compared with Wall Street expectations:\n\nEarnings per share: $4.88 vs $4.74 per share expected by LSEG Revenue: $9.56 billion vs.9.53 billion expected by LSEG Total memberships: 277.65 million global paid memberships vs. 274.4 million expected, according to StreetAccount\n\nRevenue was roughly $9.6 billion, up 17% compared to the same quarter last year, driven primarily by the increase in average paid memberships.\n\nNetflix said it now expects full-year reported revenue growth of 14% to 15%, compared with previous guidance of 13% to 15%.\n\nThe company reported net income of $2.15 billion, or $4.88 per share, up from $1.49 billion, or $3.29 per share, during the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNetflix's global paid memberships rose 16.5% year over year to 278 million. This marks one of the last updates Netflix will release regarding its membership numbers.\n\nLast quarter the company warned investors it would stop providing quarterly membership numbers or average revenue per user beginning next year, noting the company is \"focused on revenue and operating margin as our primary financial metrics -- and engagement (i.e. time spent) as our best proxy for customer satisfaction.\"\n\nStock Chart IconStock chart icon\n\nNetflix's stock has been uplifted by its crackdown on password sharing and the addition of a cheaper, ad-supported tier.\n\nNetflix began focusing on different business strategies to drive revenue growth after the streamer saw subscriber growth slow in 2022. In May, Netflix said it would launch its own ad platform and no longer partner with Microsoft for that technology. The company has also begun adding live sports, such as NFL games on Christmas Day over the next three years, a move that will likely attract more ad dollars for the streamer.\n\nThe company said its cheaper, ad-supported tier has been gaining traction, with these subscribers accounting for more than 45% of signups in the markets where the option is offered.\n\nHowever, Netflix noted on Thursday that the ad-supported business is still young, and it doesn't expect ad revenue to be a \"primary driver of our revenue growth in 2024 or 2025.\"\n\n\"The near term challenge (and medium term opportunity) is that we're scaling faster than our ability to monetize our growing ad inventory,\" the company said in its earnings release.\n\nOn this note, Netflix added it believes it's on track to \"achieve critical ad subscriber scale for our advertisers\" in 2025, allowing it to further increase its ad-tier memberships in 2026 and beyond.\n\nNetflix co-founder Reed Hastings admitted in late 2022 he was slow to come around to offering a cheaper, ad-supported option for subscribers since he was focused on digital competition from Facebook and Google.\n\nThis is breaking news.

Discovery, CNN's parent company), fueled in part by the company's recent effort to push users who share passwords to create their own accounts.\n\nHowever, the short-term subscriber jolt from the password-sharing crackdown could soon fade. The company recently disclosed that it would stop sharing its quarterly subscriber numbers beginning in 2025.\n\nIn the never-ending battle for eyeballs between traditional media companies and newer entrants like YouTube and TikTok, Netflix has, in the past two months, pushed further into the world of live sports programming and experiences.\n\nAnd with Netflix's recent advance into advertising, the company is starting to look closer to the traditional media companies it seeks to disrupt, said Tim Nollen, a Netflix analyst at Macquarie.\n\n\"Whatever the old broadcasters were in their best of times, Netflix is becoming that in a new and probably longer-term, sustainable way,\" he said.\n\nIn May, Netflix disclosed that it has 40 million monthly active users on its new ad-supported subscription tier, a jump from 23 million in January.\n\nNetflix reports second-quarter earnings on Thursday after the bell, likely further shedding light on its strategy.\n\nThe early stages of Netflix's evolution\n\nNetflix made its biggest sports announcement yet in May. The company made a three-year deal to broadcast the NFL's Christmas Day games. The deal kicks off this year with Netflix globally airing two NFL games on the holiday. In 2025 and 2026, Netflix will stream at least one holiday game.\n\n\"Netflix is now in live sports,\" Nollen said. \"This means Netflix might be the only place you will be able to watch those two Christmas Day games, which could obviously add more subscribers.\"\n\nAiring football games has proven itself to be a winning strategy to juice subscriber numbers: In January, Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service, saw a jump of 2.8 million sign-ups in the three days leading up to its exclusive airing of an NFL playoff game.\n\nThe event was \"the single biggest subscriber acquisition moment ever measured\" by Peacock, according to the company.\n\nEarlier this year, Netflix also announced another high-profile foray into sports programming: A 10-year deal to air \"WWE Raw\" live, valued at more than $5 billion.\n\nBut sports aren't the only way Netflix is trying to expand its footprint. Last month, the company said it plans to open two massive entertainment venues called Netflix Houses.\n\nThe \"experiential\" complexes, in former department store locations at Dallas Galleria and King of Prussia mall (near Philadelphia), will each span more than 100,000 square feet and include events, themed gift shops and restaurants. Both will open in 2025.\n\nWhile these complexes don't quite reach the scale or footprint of Disney's or Universal's global theme parks, David Joyce, an analyst at Seaport, said the complexes are designed to drive brand loyalty.\n\n\"It should help retain those customers and keep them in the Netflix ecosystem and paying for their subscriptions for longer,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samantha_delouya@cnn.com", "name": "Samantha Delouya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Old media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

However, it's noteworthy that Netflix added 9.32 million subscribers during Q1 which blasted expectations of 5.73 million (Surprise of 3.59 million) and climbed from 1.75 million additions in the comparative quarter.\n\nTaking advantage of its subscriber growth, Netflix's Q2 sales are projected to rise 16% to $9.53 billion. Even better, earnings are expected to soar 43% to $4.70 per share versus $3.29 a share in Q2 2023.\n\nNotably, Netflix has exceeded earnings expectations in three of its last four quarterly reports posting an average earnings surprise of 9.26%.\n\nCorrelating with its expansion, Netflix shares have become more reasonably valued trading at 35.8X forward earnings compared to its five-year high of 108.3X while offering a slight discount to the median of 40.6X.\n\nConsidering its more reasonable P/E valuation now looks like an advantageous time to invest in Netflix's monstrous growth. Furthermore, NFLX tends to spike when Netflix beats earnings expectations but would be a viable buy-the-dip candidate on a selloff as an intriguing investment for 2024 and beyond.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If that is the case, how will Netflix keep its share price growing?\n\nNetflix kicks off this media earnings cycle shouting distance from its all time high share price.\n\nIt got there in part by cracking down on passwords, adding a new ad tier, aggressively increasing licensing deals, and above all consistently delivering a high volume of in-demand content to its 270M global subscribers.\n\nA year removed from debilitating Hollywood strikes, with subscriber counts stalling and market caps plummeting across the industry, it is increasingly crucial to assess both the supply and demand for streaming content.\n\nAs of Q2 2024, Netflix accounts for one quarter of the world's streaming original series. With new (or at least 'new to you') content necessary to mitigate subscriber churn, this volume gives Netflix a massive structural advantage. The next closest competitor in global supply share for original series is Amazon Prime Video at 9.0%, followed by Disney+ at 4.0%.\n\nNetflix also leads the pack in demand share of original series, at 32.9%. Demand for Netflix original content outweighing its vast supply suggests the streamer provides strong value for its 270M subscriber base relative to the monthly fee.\n\nNetflix's biggest hit in Q2 2024 was the third season of Bridgerton. The Shondaland-backed series was the most in-demand streaming original worldwide for the quarter. While Netflix Originals are often one or two season wonders, Bridgerton is proof that the company can create home grown franchises that build an audience over time.\n\nOriginals have been the core driver of Netflix's subscriber growth over the years, and the streamer also excels at leveraging its competitor's content to keep subscribers on the Netflix platform. Suits became the go-to example of this last summer, but another cost effective pillar of Netflix's churn mitigation strategy is broadcast series.\n\nIn Q2 2024, broadcast series such as ABC's Grey's Anatomy, NBC's Seinfeld, and CBS's NCIS accounted for just 1% of the TV shows available on Netflix's US catalog, but drew 7.1% of the total demand. By contrast, Netflix Originals from around the globe accounted for 67% of the US supply share and 49.8% of the demand share.\n\nNetflix's announcement last quarter that it will not release subscriber data starting in 2025 carried the assumption that growth is dying down. If that is the case, how will Netflix keep its share price growing?\n\nThe company is turning to two backbones of the very traditional TV industry it has spent the last few decades upending: advertising and live sports.\n\nNetflix's ad tier is a clear answer for increasing revenue and profits. Even as the company's ad-tier has grown slower than expected, brands understand the reach the world's largest TV platform can muster. On a long enough timeline, the ad-supported tier is expected to generate higher average revenue per user (ARPU) than its ad-free compatriots as it amasses more cost-conscious users. Importantly, advertisements have always been a feature of sports programming, which feeds directly into Netflix's other major strategic shift.\n\nSports and live events are one of the few areas where Netflix is still behind its key competitors, all of whom carry live major league sports in the US. Netflix will not be part of the NBA's new highly touted media deal, but it secured Christmas Day NFL games starting this December. This fires a shot not just at its traditional competitors but also the NBA as a whole, which historically had Christmas Day to itself on the sports calendar.\n\nWWE Raw will be the first weekly live programming on Netflix starting in 2025. Other high profile events between now and then include the Joey Chestnut-Takeru Kobayashi \"Unfinished Beef\" Labor Day Hot Dog eating contest, and the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul boxing match scheduled for November, which has been delayed once.\n\nWhile Netflix executives long downplayed the need for live sports and events, their actions are showing this will be a key part of Netflix's growth plan into 2025 and beyond.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, sports entertainment and other major live events offer more immediate upside than the company's long-term investment in gaming, which has not yielded material returns just yet.", "source": {"uri": "business.scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suits_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suits (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey's_Anatomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grey's Anatomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seinfeld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCIS (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labor Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1509/scoop_placeholder.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Revenue and earnings results topped analysts' estimates. However, profits were down from Q1 2024, when Netflix posted earnings per share of $5.10.\n\nThe company also raised its revenue growth guidance for fiscal 2024 to 14% to 15%, up from 13% to 15%.\n\nNetflix stock rose about 5% at the opening bell on Friday to over $678 per share, but it dropped down to around $651 as the day wore on, still up roughly 1.5% for the day. Year-to-date, Netflix stock has gained 38.7%.\n\nNetflix has experienced rapid growth in its cheaper ad-tier service. The service, just $6.99 per month for two streams, has largely replaced its basic, no-ad plan, which has been phased out in the UK and Canada, and will soon be phased out in the U.S. and France.\n\nAs a result, the ad-tier service grew by 34% in the quarter, compared to Q1.\n\n\"Ads fulfill two important strategic priorities for Netflix: first they enable us to offer lower prices to consumers; and second, they create an additional revenue and profit stream for the business,\" company officials said in the letter to shareholders.\n\nIn just 18 months since the ad-tier launched, the service accounts for 45% of all new subscribers.\n\nOverall, Netflix boosted its number of global paid subscribers to 278 million, up 3% from the previous quarter and 17% from Q2 of 2023. The spike in subscribers stems from several factors, explained CFO Spencer Neumann on the earnings call.\n\nOne is the crackdown on password sharing that went into effect last year. Another is the lower price point for the ad service, while the third is its strong content slate.\n\nThe biggest hits for the quarter include the live roast of former NFL player Tom Brady, Netflix\u02bbs first live event; season three of Bridgerton, along with the series' Baby Reindeer, Queen of Tears and The Great Indian Kapil Show. Further, the films, Under Paris, Atlas and Hit Man were also hits.\n\nIn its guidance, Netflix expects revenue growth of 14% year over year in the third quarter.\n\nHowever, the company expects paid net additions in Q3 to be lower than the third quarter of 2023, which was the first full quarter that the crackdown on passing sharing went into effect.\n\nIt also calls for 14% to 15% revenue growth for the full year, up from previous guidance of 13% to 15%.\n\nIt could be hard for Netflix to sustain the membership growth it has seen recently, now that the surge from the password-sharing changes have been in effect for a year. However, the cheaper price service will certainly help, while the ads will create another robust revenue stream.\n\nNetflix has improved its efficiency as the operating margin jumped to 27.2% in the quarter, from 22.3% in Q2 2023, and it is forecasted to hit 28.1% at the end of the year. Also, free cash flow is projected to be $6 billion for the year -- less than the $6.9 billion last year, but still a good number.\n\nNetflix earned several price target upgrades post-earnings, including BMO Capital, which raised it by $53 to $770 per share.\n\nThat seems a bit optimistic, but Netflix seems to have found its footing and should be a solid grower.

On Wednesday the streamer learned it was the most nominated brand for the 76th annual Primetime Emmy Awards. Netflix received 107 nominations across 35 series, TV movies and specials, including for dramas The Crown, Baby Reindeer, Ripley (pictured above) and 3 Body Problem; documentaries Beckham, and The Greatest Night in Pop; reality shows Love is Blind, Queer Eye and Love On The Spectrum; movies Unfrosted and Scoop; animated series Blue Eye Samurai; and its live nomination for The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady.\n\nNetflix has also just revealed the cast and release date for its next big-budget Australian original drama, Territory.\n\nAnna Torv in the forthcoming Netflix drama Territory\n\nMembership closing in on 300m\n\nNetflix global membership surged over 16% YOY from 238m to 277m. If that sort of increase is maintained, Netflix will be looking at 300m plus subscribers sometime in 2025. As co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on the earnings call, if subscriber growth continues it will increase the US$17b annual content spend proportionally.\n\nNumbers of subscribers are not released for individual countries. Australia is part of the APAC region for Netflix. The growth there was significant - 40m to 50m in the past 12 months. The growth in the Indian market would account for much of that.\n\nThe best guidance we have to the number of customers in Australia comes from Telsyte about 10 months ago when the Netflix subscribers base was reported to be just over 6m.\n\nBaby Reindeer\n\nMaking the platform better\n\nWith its latest earnings, Netflix addressed several areas of the streaming business.\n\n\"We're working to improve every aspect of Netflix so we can better serve existing and future members,\" said the company's shareholder's letter.\n\nThe platform has had a string of hit series so far in 2024. Some of the Q2 shows it named included Bridgerton S3, Baby Reindeer, Queen of Tears and The Great Indian Kapil Show. Popular Q2 films included Under Paris, Atlas and Hit Man and the largest-ever Netflix live event, The Roast of Tom Brady.\n\nOther highlights from the Q2 earnings were:\n\n* We began testing a new, simpler and more intuitive TV homepage in June, which we believe will significantly improve the discovery experience on Netflix.\n\n* We're making steady progress scaling our ads business. Ads tier membership grew 34% quarter on quarter, and we're building an in-house ad tech platform that we'll test in Canada in 2024 and launch more broadly in 2025.\n\nEngagement and competition\n\nThe company updated investors on time spent viewing, both via Netflix and its competitors:\n\nViewing is key to Netflix's success. It's the best proxy we have for member happiness, and when people watch more, they stick around longer (retention), talk about Netflix more often (which drives acquisition) and place a higher value on our service.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, streaming accounts for 40% of total TV time in the US today, with Netflix and YouTube the clear leaders in direct-to-consumer entertainment.\n\nCollectively our two services account for almost half of all streaming TV watch time in the US. In H1 2024 (and despite headwinds from paid sharing) Netflix generated more view hours in the Nielsen Top 10 across film, series and licensed titles than all the other streamers combined. The challenge for so many of our competitors is that while they are investing heavily in premium content, it's generating relatively small viewing on their streaming services and linear continues to decline.\n\nNetflix and YouTube compete for people's time and attention. Our movies and TV shows drive excitement and fan engagement on YouTube, as well as social media. We believe that our entertainment offering satisfies important needs for both consumers and the creators of great movies and TV shows, who need partners that can share in the risk inherent in bringing these stories to life. Looking to the future, we believe our biggest opportunity is winning a larger share of the 80%+ of TV time (primarily linear and streaming) that neither Netflix nor YouTube has today.\n\nWhy Netflix is spending US$17m this year on content\n\nOne thing heard often from market observers is the amount of content commissioned for Netflix.\n\nCommentators often ask if Netflix needs so many shows and films, and the answer is an emphatic yes. With 278m member households -- and more than two people per household on average -- we're programming for an audience of over 600m. It's a huge number and to delight this many people, we need lots of great stories that appeal to many different tastes and moods. It's why we continue to increase the investment in our programming, even as many of our competitors are pulling back.\n\nIn Q2, we delivered variety and quality across an amazing slate of loved titles, including Bridgerton season 3 (98.5m views), which is now our sixth most popular English language TV series of all time. #Polin [Penelope and Colin] also propelled seasons one and two of Bridgerton, as well as Shondaland's prequel Queen Charlotte, back into the Top 10. Under Paris*, our buzzy shark horror movie from France, is now number three on our most popular non-English film list with 90.9m views. Other successful titles include the Spanish investigative TV thriller The Asunta Case (31.3m views), the crime series Crooks from Germany (15.7m views), which we just renewed for a second season, Queen of Tears (29.3m) from Korea as well as the sci-fi action movie Atlas starring Jennifer Lopez (79.3m views), the acclaimed comedy Hit Man (33.2m views) and City Hunter (16.5m views), a live action adaptation of the Japanese manga.\n\nHits still to come in 2025\n\nIn an answer to a question on the analysts call, co-CEO Ted Sarandos spoke about key content still to come:\n\nJust before the end of this year, we've got the Squid Game return. We've got Emily in Paris return. You've got a new season of Selling Sunset, Lincoln Lawyer, The Diplomat, Virgin River, Love is Blind. Ryan Murphy has an incredible new season of Monsters that tell the Lyle and Erik Menendez story.\n\nNetflix live\n\nThe Roast of Tom Brady (22.6m views) was the platform's biggest success ever in live event programming. Something Netflix calls its ability to deliver big, buzzy live moments for its members.\n\nThere is a slate of live events scheduled which will include Joe Rogan: Burn the Boats, a live comedy special broadcasting into Australia on August 4. It is Rogan's first comedy special in six years. Also, Chestnut vs Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef (a hot dog-eating competition!), the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson boxing match as well as weekly WWE programming starting in 2025. In the US, Netflix will be the home for both Christmas Day NFL games this year.\n\nPartners yes, Bundling no\n\nThe streaming service also explained its ongoing relationship with partners. And it clarified its stance on bundling which many see as a solution for some of streaming platforms searching for profitability.\n\nFrom the early days of streaming, we saw partnerships with device makers and pay TV and mobile operators as key to ensuring Netflix was easy to find and use. These partnerships are a win-win - making it simple for people to discover, sign up, use and pay for Netflix. In turn, our device and operator partners benefit through increased device sales from consumers seeking devices integrated with Netflix and greater customer acquisition and higher retention as well as the opportunity to upsell higher-value data or content packages.\n\nWe haven't bundled Netflix solely with other streamers like Disney+ or Max because Netflix already operates as a go-to destination for entertainment thanks to the breadth and variety of our slate and superior product experience. This has driven industry-leading penetration, engagement and retention for us, which limits the benefit to Netflix of bundling directly with other streamers.\n\nAdvertising: Ratings coming to UK market\n\nAdvertising has been key to driving subscriber growth, as Netflix explained.\n\nAds fulfill two important strategic priorities for Netflix: first they enable us to offer lower prices to consumers; and second, they create an additional revenue and profit stream for the business. Just over 18 months since launch, we continue to scale our ads tier, which now accounts for over 45% of all signups in our ads markets.\n\nIts attractiveness ($8 a month in Australia) - coupled with the phasing out of our Basic plan in the UK and Canada, which we will now start in the US and France - has increased our ads member base by 34% sequentially in Q2.\n\nWe also continue to improve the service we offer advertisers. For example, in the UK, starting September, Barb will measure Netflix's ad-supported plan, making it easier for clients to plan campaigns and understand their audiences on Netflix.\n\nTesting new ad tech, expanding programmatic\n\nWe also have new features like the \"pause\" or \"keep watching\" ads and in the two months since the launch of the beta in May, we've closed over 60 pause ad campaigns with big brands like Expedia, Coca-Cola, Ford, L'Or\u00e9al and McDonald's. Most important of all, at our Upfront, we announced our new, in-house ad tech platform, which we'll test in Canada later in 2024 and launch more broadly in 2025. This will give advertisers new ways to buy, insights to leverage and ways to measure impact.\n\nOn the programmatic side, we'll also expand our capabilities this summer to include The Trade Desk, Google DV 360, and Magnite.\n\nOur ad revenue is growing nicely and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to our business. But building a business from scratch takes time -- and coupled with the large size of our subscription revenue -- we don't expect advertising to be a primary driver of our revenue growth in 2024 or 2025.\n\nSee also: Netflix and YouTube remain top choice for Australian audiences: YouGov\n\nRelated Items:ad tier, Netflix, Telsyte", "source": {"uri": "mediaweek.com.au", "dataType": "news",

Right now, the analyst sees a small impact from the ad-supported plan.\n\nThe key to growth for advertising-supported plans will likely be the company's new live sports rights which will come later in 2024 and 2025, the analyst noted.\n\n\"Streaming of live events and sports is essential to the AVOD effort given the desirability for reach and simultaneous viewing.\"\n\n\"We still do not feel the current valuation can be justified even valuing Netflix as a Nasdaq 100 high growth technology name and disregarding its hybrid media stock character.\"\n\nHarrigan said investors may pay attention to momentum for Netflix more than valuation.\n\nMacquarie on Netflix: The ad-supported tier is key for Netflix's future and could add up in 2025, Nollen said in a new investor note.\n\nThe analyst forecasts $2.5 billion in ad revenue for Netflix in fiscal 2025 with ad-supported monthly active users doubling to around 90 million.\n\n\"Netflix continues to enhance monetization of its already scaled user base,\" Nollen said.\n\nThe analyst said the advertising efforts had a difficult start and challenges for the content company. The ad-supported plan also still lacks sufficient scale for some of the largest advertisers, the analyst noted.\n\n\"It has reportedly slashed CPMs to remain competitive, while advertisers have voiced concerns about weak targeting and measurement features.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, the analyst sees recent strategic changes pointing to a step up in revenue for advertising in 2025. This includes cancelling its basic tier and forcing users to the ad-supported tier, the analyst noted.\n\nNollen said partnerships with Google, The Trade Desk and Magnite should also offer increased demand and better matching for advertisers.\n\n\"We see multiple levers, including ad sub growth and enhanced ad tech underpinning a material step-up in 2025E advertising revenue.\"\n\nNFLX Price Action: Netflix stock trades at $653.60 versus a 52-week trading range of $344.73 to $697.49.

The company recently phased out its ad-free Basic plan, and currently is building an in-house ad tech platform that it expects to test in Canada this year and launch more broadly in 2025.\n\nOther Q2 successes for Netflix cited in its report include Bridgerton Season 3, which saw 98.5 million views in Q2 and helped Netflix reach 172 million views across all Bridgerton universe content. Baby Reindeer and Under Paris were also cited as successes.\n\nHowever, Netflix is predicting a drop in paid net adds in the coming quarter, and soon, we won't be able to track these numbers at all.

Discovery, CNN's parent company), fueled in part by the company's recent effort to push users who share passwords to create their own accounts.\n\nHowever, the short-term subscriber jolt from the password-sharing crackdown could soon fade. The company recently disclosed that it would stop sharing its quarterly subscriber numbers beginning in 2025.\n\nIn the never-ending battle for eyeballs between traditional media companies and newer entrants like YouTube and TikTok, Netflix has, in the past two months, pushed further into the world of live sports programming and experiences.\n\nAnd with Netflix's recent advance into advertising, the company is starting to look closer to the traditional media companies it seeks to disrupt, said Tim Nollen, a Netflix analyst at Macquarie.\n\n\"Whatever the old broadcasters were in their best of times, Netflix is becoming that in a new and probably longer-term, sustainable way,\" he said.\n\nIn May, Netflix disclosed that it has 40 million monthly active users on its new ad-supported subscription tier, a jump from 23 million in January.\n\nNetflix reports second-quarter earnings on Thursday after the bell, likely further shedding light on its strategy.\n\nThe early stages of Netflix's evolution\n\nNetflix made its biggest sports announcement yet in May. The company made a three-year deal to broadcast the NFL's Christmas Day games. The deal kicks off this year with Netflix globally airing two NFL games on the holiday. In 2025 and 2026, Netflix will stream at least one holiday game.\n\n\"Netflix is now in live sports,\" Nollen said. \"This means Netflix might be the only place you will be able to watch those two Christmas Day games, which could obviously add more subscribers.\"\n\nAiring football games has proven itself to be a winning strategy to juice subscriber numbers: In January, Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service, saw a jump of 2.8 million sign-ups in the three days leading up to its exclusive airing of an NFL playoff game.\n\nThe event was \"the single biggest subscriber acquisition moment ever measured\" by Peacock, according to the company.\n\nEarlier this year, Netflix also announced another high-profile foray into sports programming: A 10-year deal to air \"WWE Raw\" live, valued at more than $5 billion.\n\nBut sports aren't the only way Netflix is trying to expand its footprint. Last month, the company said it plans to open two massive entertainment venues called Netflix Houses.\n\nThe \"experiential\" complexes, in former department store locations at Dallas Galleria and King of Prussia mall (near Philadelphia), will each span more than 100,000 square feet and include events, themed gift shops and restaurants. Both will open in 2025.\n\nWhile these complexes don't quite reach the scale or footprint of Disney's or Universal's global theme parks, David Joyce, an analyst at Seaport, said the complexes are designed to drive brand loyalty.\n\n\"It should help retain those customers and keep them in the Netflix ecosystem and paying for their subscriptions for longer,\" he said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Investors have been zeroing in on the company's relatively new advertising business as a potential source of growth.\n\nOn Thursday, Netflix said third-quarter subscriber gains would be lower than the comparable period in 2023 when it had just started the password clamp-down.\n\nThe company also said its vice president of ad sales, Peter Naylor, was departing.\n\nThird Bridge analyst Jamie Lumley said Netflix's advertising business \"has yet to prove itself from a revenue standpoint.\"\n\n\"Our experts highlight that Amazon has made a much bigger splash in the ad market and Netflix needs to continue working on scale in this segment if it wants to be a major player,\" Lumley said.\n\nFor April through June, Netflix posted diluted per-share earnings of $4.88, compared with consensus forecasts of $4.74 a share, according to LSEG. Revenue for the quarter reached $9.56 billion, in line with estimates.\n\nAt the end of June, the new sign-ups brought the total number of global Netflix subscribers to more than 277 million.\n\nNetflix said its ad tier membership grew 34% from the prior quarter, but it did not say how many subscribers chose that option.\n\n\"Our ad business is growing nicely and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to our business,\" Netflix said in a letter to investors. \"But building a business from scratch takes time - and coupled with the large size of our subscription revenue - we don't expect advertising to be a primary driver of our revenue growth in 2024 or 2025.\"\n\nOn a post-earnings video, Netflix Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said the company's advertising business is \"growing nicely,\" but it is building off a small base.\n\n\"It's a meaningful contributor,\" Neumann said. \"And then we get (to) '26 and beyond, it can be even more meaningful, and hopefully comes to the point where it's a primary contributor.\"\n\nThe company said it expects third-quarter revenue growth of 14% compared with a year ago.\n\nThree years into its videogame initiative, Netflix said it planned to release a multiplayer game based on \"Squid Game\" later this year when it debuts Season Two of the dystopian Korean series. It also plans games tied to \"Emily in Paris\" and \"Selling Sunset.\"\n\n(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski and Lisa Richwine in Los AngelesAdditional reporting by Juby Babu in Mexico CityEditing by Sayantani Ghosh and Matthew Lewis)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selling_Sunset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selling Sunset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_in_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emily in Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Lewis_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Lewis (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multiplayer video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/theprint_default_image_new.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Previously, the company dropped the basic plan in the U.K. and Canada.\n\nThe basic plan is not displayed as an option for U.S. subscribers on its Plan and Pricing page for U.S. customers. The company quit offering the basic plan for new subscribers in July 2023, but allowed basic plan customers to remain on the subscription so long as they didn't cancel or change plans.\n\nOther Netflix plans include a $6.99 monthly option with ads, a $15.49 monthly standard HD video quality plan (no ads) and a $22.99 premium Ultra HD plan (no ads).\n\nNetflix, which began offering an ad-supported plan in November 2022, said the \"attractiveness\" of the ad-supported plan led to an increase in subscriptions of 34% during the April-June 2024 period, but did not say how many subscribers were added.\n\nNetflix subscribers in the U.S. and in France who are currently on the Basic plan will have to choose a new plan, the company said in a statement to USA TODAY. Those members impacted will get an email starting today, the company said.\n\nEven without the basic, ad-free offering, Netflix represents \"a very strong offering for our members,\" when you consider the $6.99 monthly ad-supported option, said co-CEO Greg Peters, during a videoconference about the company's second quarter performance Thursday.\n\n\"Essentially, we're providing them a better experience: two streams versus one. We've got higher definition. We got downloads. And, of course, all at a lower price,\" he said. \"And for members who don't want that ads experience, they, of course, can choose our ad-free Standard or Premium plans.\"\n\nThe company reported its third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, with $9.56 billion in revenue in the second quarter of 2024, up 16.8% over the same quarter in 2023.\n\nNetflix added more than 8 million subscribers in the second quarter, benefiting from the return of series such as \"Bridgerton,\" and \"Baby Reindeer\" and the live event \"The Roast of Tom Brady,\" as well as a password-sharing crackdown.\n\nWhat Netflix plans are there?\n\nNetflix adds 8 million new subscribers\n\nTotal number of subscribers grew to more than 277.6 million, an increase of 16.5%, the company said.

With new (or at least 'new to you') content necessary to mitigate subscriber churn, this volume gives Netflix a massive structural advantage. The next closest competitor in global supply share for original series is Amazon Prime Video at 9.0%, followed by Disney+ at 4.0%.\n\nNetflix also leads the pack in demand share of original series, at 32.9%. Demand for Netflix original content outweighing its vast supply suggests the streamer provides strong value for its 270M subscriber base relative to the monthly fee.\n\nNetflix's biggest hit in Q2 2024 was the third season of Bridgerton. The Shondaland-backed series was the most in-demand streaming original worldwide for the quarter. While Netflix Originals are often one or two season wonders, Bridgerton is proof that the company can create home grown franchises that build an audience over time.\n\nOriginals have been the core driver of Netflix's subscriber growth over the years, and the streamer also excels at leveraging its competitor's content to keep subscribers on the Netflix platform. Suits became the go-to example of this last summer, but another cost effective pillar of Netflix's churn mitigation strategy is broadcast series.\n\nIn Q2 2024, broadcast series such as ABC's Grey's Anatomy, NBC's Seinfeld, and CBS's NCIS accounted for just 1% of the TV shows available on Netflix's US catalog, but drew 7.1% of the total demand. By contrast, Netflix Originals from around the globe accounted for 67% of the US supply share and 49.8% of the demand share.\n\nNetflix's announcement last quarter that it will not release subscriber data starting in 2025 carried the assumption that growth is dying down. If that is the case, how will Netflix keep its share price growing?\n\nThe company is turning to two backbones of the very traditional TV industry it has spent the last few decades upending: advertising and live sports.\n\nNetflix's ad tier is a clear answer for increasing revenue and profits. Even as the company's ad-tier has grown slower than expected, brands understand the reach the world's largest TV platform can muster. On a long enough timeline, the ad-supported tier is expected to generate higher average revenue per user (ARPU) than its ad-free compatriots as it amasses more cost-conscious users. Importantly, advertisements have always been a feature of sports programming, which feeds directly into Netflix's other major strategic shift.\n\nSports and live events are one of the few areas where Netflix is still behind its key competitors, all of whom carry live major league sports in the US. Netflix will not be part of the NBA's new highly touted media deal, but it secured Christmas Day NFL games starting this December. This fires a shot not just at its traditional competitors but also the NBA as a whole, which historically had Christmas Day to itself on the sports calendar.\n\nWWE Raw will be the first weekly live programming on Netflix starting in 2025. Other high profile events between now and then include the Joey Chestnut-Takeru Kobayashi \"Unfinished Beef\" Labor Day Hot Dog eating contest, and the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul boxing match scheduled for November, which has been delayed once.\n\nWhile Netflix executives long downplayed the need for live sports and events, their actions are showing this will be a key part of Netflix's growth plan into 2025 and beyond.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, sports entertainment and other major live events offer more immediate upside than the company's long-term investment in gaming, which has not yielded material returns just yet.", "source": {"uri": "scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suits_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suits (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey's_Anatomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grey's Anatomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seinfeld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCIS (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labor Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The company recently phased out its ad-free Basic plan, and currently is building an in-house ad tech platform that it expects to test in Canada this year and launch more broadly in 2025.\n\nOther Q2 successes for Netflix cited in its report include Bridgerton Season 3, which saw 98.5 million views in Q2 and helped Netflix reach 172 million views across all Bridgerton universe content. Baby Reindeer and Under Paris were also cited as successes.\n\nHowever, Netflix is predicting a drop in paid net adds in the coming quarter, and soon, we won't be able to track these numbers at all. The company has said it will stop reporting subscription numbers beginning in 2025, citing user-engagement metrics and finanancial metrics as better trackers of the company's success.\n\nPer its earnings, Netflix revenue for the quarter reached $9.56 billion, up 17% year-over-year.

The company's ad revenue is expected to have more than doubled in the June quarter.Netflix likely added the fewest number of subscribers in five quarters during April-June as sharp gains following a crackdown on password sharing ebbed and viewer attention moved to summer sporting events including the Euro soccer tournament.\n\nThe company added an estimated 4.82 million subscribers in the second quarter, according to LSEG data. That would be the lowest additions since the first quarter of 2023 and about half the 9.3 million it added in the previous three months.\n\nStill, the streaming giant's efforts to sell a lower-priced ad-supported tier have yielded strong ad revenue growth. The company's ad revenue is expected to have more than doubled in the June quarter.\n\nOverall revenue likely rose 16.4% to $9.53 billion, marking the fastest growth since the second quarter of 2021.\n\nNetflix's original shows such as the historical romance \"Bridgerton\" and the limited series \"Baby Reindeer\" - based on comedian Richard Gadd's experience with a stalker - topped most-watched charts in the second quarter, according to Nielsen data.\n\nWhen it reports second-quarter results on Thursday, investors will scrutinize the streaming giant's efforts to expand its lower-priced plan with advertising and look for updates on new growth drivers.\n\nIn May, the company said its ad-supported tier reached 40 million monthly active users across the globe and accounted for 40% of all sign-ups in the countries it was available, up from 23 million in January.\n\nThe ad push has resonated with investors. For the year, Netflix's stock is up nearly 35%, compared with a return of about 19% on the S&P 500 index.\n\nSeasonally, viewership during summer months for Netflix and its rivals such as Disney+ also takes a hit as people travel. This year, the Olympic Games that begin on July 26 are also expected to draw some viewers away from Netflix, according to analysts.\n\nAd focus\n\nAfter investing heavily in originals, brokerage MoffettNathanson noted Netflix is also able to drive viewership with its competitors' content. Eighteen of the top 20 streamed titles were acquired shows, such as \"NCIS\" or \"Grey's Anatomy,\" it noted.\n\nNetflix has also announced bundling partnerships. Comcast is offering Netflix with its Peacock streaming service and Apple TV+ for its Xfinity internet and TV customers.\n\nNetflix is also hosting more live content, including its deal to stream two National Football League games on Christmas Day, to create advertiser-friendly events.\n\n\"More live-event announcements will ensue as the company looks to improve its ad-supported time spent, amid an industry-wide reduction in scripted content production,\" Ross Benes, senior analyst at Emarketer, said.\n\nTo drive the next phase of growth, Netflix announced plans in May to build an in-house ad technology platform that will offer marketers more ways to buy commercials and measure their performance. It initially leaned on Microsoft to build the backbone of the ad tier.\n\n\"Despite this progress, we continue to view advertising as a longer term story and do not expect a material revenue contribution until 2025,\" BofA Global Research analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said in a note on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_series_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Limited series (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfinity", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xfinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Product bundling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey's_Anatomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grey's Anatomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCIS (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111808087,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-223184,overlay-ettech/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 1968, "textEnd": 1975}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Netflix's stock has been uplifted in recent quarters by its push to gain subscribers on its cheaper, ad-supported tier, in addition to its crackdown on password sharing.\n\nThe company has also begun adding live sports, such as NFL games on Christmas Day over the next three years, a move that will likely attract more ad dollars for the streamer.\n\nNetflix had roughly 270 million global subscribers at the end of the first quarter, up 16% from the same period in year prior and surpassing expectations.\n\nWhen Netflix made its pitch to advertisers during its Upfront presentation in May, the company said its ad-supported tier had amassed 40 million global monthly active users, nearly double the figure it had shared months earlier.\n\nLast quarter Netflix warned investors it would stop providing quarterly membership numbers or average revenue per user beginning next year, noting the company is \"focused on revenue and operating margin as our primary financial metrics -- and engagement (i.e. time spent) as our best proxy for customer satisfaction.\"\n\nThis decision showcases Netflix's \"pivot from a high-growth, low-profit business to a slow-growth, high-profit business,\" according to an analyst note from Wedbush last week.

Netflix doesn't see direct bundles with other popular streaming platforms, however, as such a straightforward \"win-win.\"\n\n\"We haven't bundled Netflix solely with other streamers like Disney+ or Max because Netflix already operates as a go-to destination for entertainment thanks to the breadth and variety of our slate and superior product experience,\" the message reads. \"This has driven industry leading penetration, engagement and retention for us, which limits the benefit to Netflix of bundling directly with other streamers.\"\n\nIn a footnote, Netflix acknowledged that third-party operators may include Netflix in a streaming bundle with other services. This is likely a reference to Comcast's Streamsaver, which bundles Netflix with Apple TV+ and Peacock.\n\nNetflix also didn't make a secret of the kinds of direct bundles it was referencing. In the letter to shareholders, Netflix specifically hyperlinked to Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery's May 2024 announcement of a Disney+, Hulu, and Max bundle.\n\nNetflix's statement on the matter might seem a little arrogant, but it has reason to run a victory lap. It reported today yet another quarter of both revenue and subscriber growth, bringing in 8 million new subs in Q2 for a total of 277.65 million.

The 16.5% increase in subscribers equates to a 17% year-on-year increase in revenue and a 44% increase in profits.\n\nNetflix said the growth can be attributed to the ongoing benefit from its recent crackdown on password sharing as well as recent original titles proving popular.\n\nAs a result of the success of Netflix's strategy to mitigate free sharing and convert these users into paying subscribers, Disney+ has made its own plans to enact stricter password-sharing policies in the hope of driving growth.\n\n\"We're clearly seeing healthy organic growth in the business, but we're also continuing to get better and better at translating improvements in our service into business value, including getting better and better at converting unpaid accounts,\" said Netflix's CFO Spencer Neumann to analysts on Thursday, adding \"On the paid member front, we're also probably benefiting from that attractive entry point in terms of price point and feature set for our ads plan.\"\n\nAs the impact of the password-sharing clampdown declines, so will the corresponding surge in revenue.

If we execute well -- better stories, easier discovery and more fandom -- while also establishing ourselves in newer areas like live, games and advertising, we believe that we have a lot more room to grow.\"\n\nIn order to drive this, Netflix has recently redesigned its home screen intending to make it easier for users to find content they want to watch.

Although the platform has continued to grow despite this, the number of new subscribers has been falling in recent quarters - which could be a result of the anti-sharing measures.\n\nAs reported by Reuters, data from LSEG revealed that Netflix's growth has been slowing since the first quarter of 2024. The platform gained 4.82 million subscribers in the second quarter, which would be the lowest number since the first quarter of 2023. For comparison, Netflix gained almost 15 million subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nHowever, although the company is having a harder time gaining new subscribers, Netflix is also successfully increasing its revenue from advertising. That's because the company is pushing its most affordable ad-based plan, which costs $6.99 per month in the US.\n\nEarlier this month, Netflix phased out its most affordable ad-free plan, which cost $11.99 per month. Netflix users who want to get rid of ads now must upgrade to the Standard plan, which costs $15.49 per month. The 4K plan, which is also ad-free, costs $22.99 per month.\n\nLSEG estimates that the company's ad revenue more than doubled in the June quarter, reaching $9.53 billion - the highest growth since the second quarter of 2021.\n\nNetflix isn't the only platform investing in new ad-based plans. Disney+ also introduced a cheaper plan with ads in 2022, while it started cracking down on password sharing earlier this year.\n\nAccording to rumors, Apple TV+ is also considering launching an ad-supported plan. The company recently increased the subscription price from $6.99 per month to $9.99 per month in the US.\n\nIn the last quarter, Apple TV+ overtook Paramount+ in the US streaming market share and is now getting closer to Hulu and Disney+.", "source": {"uri": "9to5mac.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "9to5Mac"}, "authors": [{"uri": "filipe_esposito@9to5mac.com", "name": "Filipe Esp\u00f3sito", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/netflix-subs-down.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

With the jump in paid subscriptions, Netflix now has a total of 277.65 million paid subscribers around the world, marking 16.5 percent year-over-year growth.\n\nAd tier memberships increased 34 percent quarter-over-quarter, thanks to Netflix pushing its ad-supported tier. Netflix eliminated its cheapest ad-free \"Basic\" subscription tier last year, and earlier in July, the company began warning customers in the UK and Canada that they would need to move to a new plan.\n\nIn the United States, the Basic plan was priced at $9.99 per month, but the cheapest ad-free Netflix plan is now priced at $15.49 a month. Netflix had been allowing customers that were already on the Basic plan to continue using it, but that is being phased out. Ad tier memberships grew 34 percent from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2024.\n\nNetflix with ads is priced at $6.99 per month, and it includes between four and five minutes of ads per hour. Ads vary in length from 15 to 30 seconds and play before and during TV shows and movies. The company says that it will soon test an in-house ad tech platform in Canada, with plans to launch it broadly in 2025.\n\nNetflix saw 17 percent growth in revenue year-over-year, and it is expecting overall 2024 growth to be at 14 to 15 percent.

Netflix doesn't see direct bundles with other popular streaming platforms, however, as such a straightforward \"win-win.\"\n\n\"We haven't bundled Netflix solely with other streamers like Disney+ or Max because Netflix already operates as a go-to destination for entertainment thanks to the breadth and variety of our slate and superior product experience,\" the message reads. \"This has driven industry leading penetration, engagement and retention for us, which limits the benefit to Netflix of bundling directly with other streamers.\"\n\nIn a footnote, Netflix acknowledged that third-party operators may include Netflix in a streaming bundle with other services. This is likely a reference to Comcast's Streamsaver, which bundles Netflix with Apple TV+ and Peacock.\n\nNetflix also didn't make a secret of the kinds of direct bundles it was referencing. In the letter to shareholders, Netflix specifically hyperlinked to Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery's May 2024 announcement of a Disney+, Hulu, and Max bundle.\n\nNetflix's statement on the matter might seem a little arrogant, but it has reason to run a victory lap. It reported today yet another quarter of both revenue and subscriber growth, bringing in 8 million new subs in Q2 for a total of 277.65 million. That success, however, comes with a bit of a caveat, as Netflix is bracing for a drop in paid net adds in the coming quarter.\n\nAlex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

But management forecast slower growth ahead -- setting expectations for lower paid net additions next quarter compared to the year prior -- partly because it has already reaped gains from its successful password-sharing crackdown, launched about a year ago.\n\nMeanwhile, co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters discussed the potential benefits of generative artificial intelligence during their earnings chat and also gave updates on Netflix's advertising tier, which has been in place for 18 months and now accounts for 45 percent of all signups in markets with that tier.\n\nSo Wall Street analysts had much to ponder after the earnings update, especially following stock price target hikes from several heading into the report. In pre-market trading Friday, Netflix shares were little changed, trending up around 1 percent.\n\nMany analysts came away feeling that the results didn't move the needle too much in terms of their financial expectations and view on the stock, but some more experts pushed up their price targets.\n\nBMO Capital Markets analyst Brian Pitz was one of them. Reiterating his \"outperform\" rating, he increased his financial estimates and boosted his target stock price from $713 to $770. He estimates that Netflix will cross the 50 million ad-tier member milestone by the end of 2024. Pitz also praised Netflix for its gaming push. \"We applaud management's gaming strategy with a new multi-player Squid Game product launching by year-end 2024,\" he wrote. \"Gaming is an underappreciated medium-term opportunity with $150 billion [total addressable market]. ... Management plans to launch one new title per month for Netflix Stories. We applaud an acceleration of game content investment, given deep intellectual property synergies, incrementality to overall engagement, and attractive unit economics.\"\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney also increased his stock price target on Netflix, in his case by $10 to $710. \"Against The Sum of All Fears, An Impressive Quarter,\" he summarized his take on the streamer's latest results.\n\nHe also shared his four top takeaways. \"Netflix's user growth is intrinsically very impressive,\" Mahaney emphasized. \"We still see four average revenue per user (ARPU) tailwinds in the second half and '25 - a) foreign-exchange headwinds will hopefully peak soon; b) Netflix is rolling out international price increases, most recently in Germany, Brazil and Argentina; c) ad monetization should ramp up as Netflix eventually gets its ads together - in-house ad tech platform, programmatic partnerships, real scale (i.e. 50 million) in terms of ad viewers; and d) Netflix flexes Sunset Power - now removing the basic tier in the U.S. and France, and this should be nicely accretive.\"\n\nThe Evercore ISI expert noted, \"Netflix's margins are soaring ... and we picked up a clear commitment to ongoing margin expansion in fiscal year 2025 and beyond.\"\n\nFinally, Mahaney touted \"an impressive content slate coming up - we give the Oscar for best executive recall on an earnings call to co-CEO Ted Sarandos, who finished the earnings call with a 3-minute tour-de-force of all the content coming up on Netflix, from renewals of Emily in Paris and Squid Game to the Tyson-Paul brawl to the Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef 'special' to hit programs in multiple international markets. With more and more content coming onto the network - including live sports - Netflix is increasingly becoming ... TV.\"\n\nAnother $10 stock price target boost, to $695 came from Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen who reiterated his \"outperform\" rating on Friday. \"Fundamentals are solid,\" he concluded. \"Keep long-term potential in mind over any quarter-by-quarter fluctuations.\" But he also highlighted: \"Netflix has to step up its efforts to build out its ad business.\"\n\nSanford C. Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon also hiked his Netflix stock price target, by $25 to $620, while maintaining his \"market-perform\" rating in a report entitled \"Have we seen this movie?\"\n\n\"What seemed to be an almost impossible number to hit in '24 is within sight - 30 million net adds in '24, implying more than 11 percent member growth from '23 despite the cautious third-quarter sub growth guidance,\" Yoon wrote. \"Growth in '24 sets the baseline for longer-term projections, and, once again, we're adjusting our estimates upward.\"\n\nPlus, MoffettNathanson analysts Robert Fishman and Michael Nathanson maintained their 'neutral' rating on Netflix but pushed their price target $5 higher to $570 in a report entitled \"What's the Next Leg?\" of growth.\n\n\"While we may not be Netflix bulls, we are also certainly not Netflix bears,\" the duo wrote. \"The company has clearly and solidly cemented itself as a streaming winner in a streaming world. But in order to see meaningful upside from where the stock is today, one has to believe there's more to the story than what we already know today.\"\n\nConcluded the MoffettNathanson analysts: \"To us, the obvious growth catalysts from here are advertising and price increases. Yet, on the first piece, it is up to Netflix to prove it can effectively scale its advertising business, but it will take time with the company admitting this won't be a primary driver of revenues this year or in 2025.\" As for price increases, they warned: \"We have seen over our years covering media how hard it is to grow monetization of consumers outside the U.S., and with the plethora of streaming platforms available domestically, Netflix must walk the tightrope of extracting more money from consumers while minimizing churn.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kenneth Leon, analyst at CFRA Research, stuck to his \"buy\" rating with a $725 stock price target. \"The share price may react negatively to Netflix's guide for third-quarter revenue at $9.7 billion versus the $9.8 billion consensus, but we think this is myopic to the profitable growth we see ahead,\" he explained.\n\nTD Cowen analyst John Blackledge similarly maintained his \"buy\" rating and $775 stock price target. \"Strong content slate and paid sharing drive second-quarter sub beat,\" he explained. \"Popular second-quarter releases included original titles, such as Bridgerton season 3, Queen Charlotte, and Asunta Case, as well as films like Atlas and Hit Man. Net adds beat our expectations across all regions in the quarter.\"\n\nThe declining returns from the password-sharing crackdown led management to predict third-quarter user net adds will come in below the 8.8 million recorded in the year-ago period, \"as Netflix laps the first full quarter of paid sharing,\" Blackledge also noted.\n\nAnd he highlighted one particular challenge set to affect revenue growth. \"Management's third-quarter guide calls for revenue of $9.73 billion, up 13.9 percent year-over-year, 1.9 percent/0.8 percent below our/consensus estimates,\" the expert wrote. \"Of note, management third-quarter revenue guide comprises a roughly 5 percent foreign-exchange headwind, largely due to Argentine currency devaluation.\"\n\nRalph Schackart, analyst at William Blair, also stuck to his \"outperform\" rating without a stock price target. \"While we believe the ad-supported platform is still in need of additional refinement, we remain optimistic that both this newer tier and paid sharing will provide tailwinds to the top line through the medium term,\" he opined. \"Overall, Netflix continues to be well positioned to remain a secular streaming winner, in our view, and we believe the pricing increases will eventually flow through the model to satisfy investors.\"\n\nPivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak is also continuing to sing the praises of Netflix. \"This Is What Winning Looks Like\" was the title of his report, in which he reiterated a Street high $800 stock price target and his \"buy\" rating for what he called \"the world's dominant streaming entertainment platform.\"\n\nHe sees the business as a virtuous cycle. \"It is abundantly clear that Netflix is demonstrating massive scale as it continues to produce strong subscriber results and free cash flow with the ability to invest to accelerate that growth (through deals such as the '25 WWE agreement and the '24 Christmas NFL Games) while its streaming peers continue to generate substantial losses and generally mediocre subscriber results,\" the analyst explained.\n\nWlodarczak added, \"Recall, that increasingly those peers have resorted to selling their formally exclusive library content to Netflix. While not necessarily needed by Netflix, we believe other streaming players/media players will have no choice but to continue to sell their premium library content to Netflix to offset their own poor returns in streaming (and to tap into Netflix's about 500 million-plus global viewers to increase the content value as we saw with Netflix's carriage of Suits), which enhances the value of [the] Netflix service allowing them to drive higher subscriber growth, reduce churn and increase ARPU.\"\n\nNetflix's latest results and updates also once again drew commentary beyond Wall Street.\n\nMeanwhile, PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore shared this take in the headline of his note: \"Netflix Growth Continues Though Future Concerns Are Starting to Build.\"\n\n\"While Netflix's second-quarter 2024 earnings delivered good news at first glance, underlying issues are causing it to downplay growth for the rest of the year,\" he argued. The ad tier is one area of concern for him. \"18 months on I firmly believe that the move into advertising is taking Netflix far longer than anticipated. The latest developments have forced it to curtail its own grander ambitions,\" the analyst wrote. \"In fact, Netflix acknowledges that it does not expect advertising to be a primary driver of its revenue growth until 2026 at the earliest.\"\n\nThe streamer's push into advertising \"highlights the short to medium challenge in cracking this space,\" Pescatore suggested. \"It is up against even bigger tech giants with a huge base and scale; Amazon, Google and Meta are three that come to mind. Significantly, these companies are way ahead in terms of eyeballs, figures that Netflix is finding hard to match given it is starting from zero.\"\n\nHe also expected more from Netflix's games push at this stage. \"It is unbelievable to think that it has been three years since it started this venture,\" Pescatore wrote. \"It is hard to see how games is driving subscriber growth or engagement. Netflix is still seeking to bolster its presence, understand the space, and is still experimenting with new formats.\"\n\nThird Bridge analyst Jamie Lumley sees things more positively but also noted that more has to be done on the ad front. \"Netflix is showing that its subscriber growth strategy still works,\" he suggested. \"The company is continuing to find the right balance between optimizing its operational metrics and creating a quality experience for viewers. The ad-supported tier continues to be an important part of the subscriber growth story with a 34 percent larger base than in the first quarter. However, this segment has yet to prove itself from a revenue standpoint.\"\n\nAdded Lumley: \"Our experts highlight that Amazon has made a much bigger splash in the ad market, and Netflix needs to continue working on scale in this segment if it wants to be a major player.\"\n\nBut his overall take on Netflix is bullish. \"As investors prepare for the day when the company stops sharing subscriber numbers, Netflix has again highlighted the fundamental strength of its operating model by exceeding expectations for its industry-leading profitability metrics,\" he concluded. \"Competitors continue to gaze up enviously at Netflix's 27 percent operating margins, knowing it will be a long time before they can get there themselves.\"", "source": {"uri":

The platform, which controls the largest share of the US streaming market, saw impressive growth during the last three months.\n\nRevenues and earnings per share outpaced analysts' projections, thanks in part to the company's booming advertising business, which was launched in late 2022, and more stringent restrictions on password-sharing. Netflix's growing presence in live sports is also driving eyeballs to the platform.\n\nEarnings per share were $4.88, surpassing the $4.74 per share projected by London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG), a leading financial markets research firm.\n\nRevenue for the quarter came in at $9.56bn, above the company's anticipated $9.49bn. It represents a nearly 14% year-over-year (YoY) lift.\n\nNetflix recorded a net profit of $2.15bn in Q2, up 44%, and coming out ahead of estimates.\n\nMeanwhile, 8.05 million new subscribers joined Netflix during the period, compared to 5.89 million net new subscribers during the same period last year.\n\nThe company's total paid memberships have reached 274.4 million, according to estimates by StreetAccount, underscoring Netflix's continued success in expanding its global subscriber base. This figure represents a significant increase from the roughly 270 million global subscribers recorded at the end of the first quarter, equating to 16% year-over-year growth.\n\nHowever, the company continues to see subscriber growth rates slow in highly saturated markets, and evidence suggests that that trend will continue. In fact, Netflix is the only major streamer to record a decline in monthly usage among US adults, according to new data from Forrester. This year, 57% of US online adults indicated they use Netflix to stream TV shows or movies in the past month, compared with 60% in 2023. On the flip side, Prime Video saw a lift from 48% to 51% during the same period. \"With so much consumer choice now in streaming, Netflix's lead in the market will continue to shrink,\" predicts Mike Proulx, vice-president and research director at Forrester.\n\nBut investors don't appear to be deterred; Netflix's stock is up nearly 40% this year.\n\nNetflix's stock has benefited in recent quarters from strategic initiatives aimed at increasing its subscriber base and revenue. While the company's crackdown on password sharing has helped to line its pockets, among the biggest revenue contributors of the quarter was Netflix's nascent advertising business.\n\nNetflix was previously a subscription-only service, providing access to a vast, ad-free content library for a monthly fee. In 2022, however, the company's subscriber growth began slowing. In response, Netflix jacked up prices for paying subscribers and cracked down on password-sharing. Then, it turned to ads for the first time, debuting a cheaper, ad-supported plan. In the time since, it has retired its original Basic Plan, giving audiences the choice of a $6.99 per month ad-supported option, a $15.49 per month ad-free plan or a premium ad-free plan with higher resolution image and support for additional devices for $22.99 a month.\n\nThe expansion of its offerings have helped attract new customers, and drive revenue. In Q2 of this year, ads tier membership grew by 34% quarter-on-quarter. During an Upfront presentation in May, the company revealed that its ad-supported tier had reached 40 million global monthly active users, nearly doubling the figures reported just a few months prior.\n\nAnd today, Netflix generates more ad revenue per viewer than any other streaming platform, according to recent data from Emarketer, although the gap between it and its closest rivals is closing. On the whole, however, the company's ad revenues are on track to reach $1bn in 2024, Emarketer reports.\n\nThe company has also poured significant resources into developing its advertising business. It's introducing QR code ads as well as a binge-watching incentive that rewards viewers with an ad-free episode after streaming three episodes back-to-back. Other new ad features, like 'pause' or 'keep watching' ads, have seen high rates of adoption, including from top brands like Coke, Ford and L'Or\u00e9al in the first two months of beta testing.\n\nThe platform is also expanding its sponsorship opportunities, as well as enhancing its campaign measurement capabilities with third-party verification provided by Integral Ad Science, DoubleVerify and Nielsen ONE in the US.\n\nNetflix is currently working to develop an in-house adtech platform, to be tested in Canada in 2024 and launched to broader markets in 2025.\n\n\"Netflix's commitment to its ads business is just beginning to show signs of scaling, meaning it's headed in the right direction,\" says Forrester's Proulx. \"That's notable because ad revenue is a critical component to Netflix's go-forward growth calculus. It's because the company can't rely on net paid subscriptions alone as the primary contributor to revenue growth because they aren't trending upward.\"\n\nNetflix's foray into live sports - long the remit of broadcast and cable TV - is also bolstering its bottom line. In January, the streamer inked a 10-year $5bn deal with WWE Raw. It's also announced that Christmas day NFL games will be streamed on its platform for the next three years. The company's expansion into live sports is expected to attract more advertisers in the coming months, ultimately driving revenue.\n\nIn combination with its growing ads business, Netflix's live sports offerings could prove particularly lucrative, some experts say. \"By combining its ad-supported model with live sports streaming, Netflix not only attracts a dedicated viewer base but also creates new monetization opportunities through dynamic ad placements and exclusive content,\" says Sabya Das, president and chief operating officer at AI video technology company Magnifi. \"This dual approach underscores Netflix's ability to turn what I would have deemed a survival strategy to retain subscribers into a massive growth opportunity, solidifying itself as an entertainment hub and paving the way for innovation in personalized advertising and user experience.\"\n\nThe success of other kinds of live programming, like The Roast of Tom Brady in early May - which garnered more eyeballs than any other live Netflix event to date - hints at a major opportunity for the company.\n\nAt the same time, Netflix's core business of producing original shows and movies is still proving its worth. Among the most-viewed titles in the company's history is Bridgerton, which unveiled its third season in May of this year. Q2 saw other big hits, too, including the psychological thriller Baby Reindeer and The Great Indian Kapil Show.\n\nIn response to strong Q2 growth, Netflix has adjusted its revenue growth forecast for the year to 14%-15%, up from an earlier estimate of 13%-15%. For the full year, Netflix expects an operating margin of 26%, up from the previous estimate of 25%.\n\nAs it plans to stop providing updates on quarterly subscriber numbers and average revenue per user, Netflix plans to focus on revenue and operating margin as primary financial metrics moving forward, with engagement - measured as time spent - serving as the best proxy for customer satisfaction. This shift reflects Netflix's transition from a high-growth, low-profit business model to a slow-growth, high-profit model.\n\nA key focus for the business in the coming months will be growing investment in its advertising practice. Along with the development of a proprietary adtech platform, Netflix is expanding its programmatic capabilities this summer with the help of partners like The Trade Desk, Magnite and Google Display & Video 360.\n\nThe company also plans to onboard measurement firm Barb; starting in September, the company will provide metrics for UK ad campaigns, delivering performance insights that will help advertisers calibrate their marketing efforts.\n\nIn a letter to investors Thursday, Netflix says it expects to reach critical ad subscriber scale across its markets by 2025. Although the company doesn't advertising to account for a majority of its revenue in 2024 or 2025, it's taking an optimistic view of the long-term.\n\n\"We'e very pleased with how we're scaling our ads business,\" said Spencer Neumann, the company's chief financial officer, on a call with investors Thursday. \"We've been primarily focused on on scaling reach, but if you think about even just the revenue portion of ads, it is growing nicely. It just happens to be growing off of a relatively small base, because we're ... only 18 months into ads. [It] just takes some time. So we're scaling well through reach, through engagement, through growing inventory. And that represents opportunity for us over a multi-year trajectory to have a big and increasing revenue and profit impact on the business.\"\n\nOutside of its ads business, Netflix plans to build on its original content by leaning deeper into gaming this year. Starting this month, the company will push out a new game each month, many of which will be based on popular Netflix titles like Selling Sunset, Squid Game and Emily in Paris.\n\nThe platform is in the midst of reinventing its home screen interface, with plans to introduce a 'My Netflix' section - which is already available on mobile - to the big screen, highlighting content that the user has recently watched or saved.\n\nNetflix's stock saw a slight dip in after-hours trading, with shares dropping to $634.40, down 1.34%. Still, the company remains well-positioned for continued success as it adapts its strategies to the changing media landscape.", "source": {"uri": "thedrum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Drum"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrester_Research", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forrester Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Active users"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge-watching", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Binge-watching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calculus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Or\u00e9al", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "L'Or\u00e9al"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home_Based", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home Based", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/news/353244/netflx.png?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The less-expensive plan with ads accounted for almost half of new sign-ups last quarter in markets where it's offered, and the company said it will be large enough to appeal to major sponsors next year.\n\nThis quarter, Netflix expects to deliver earnings of US$5.10 a share, higher than Wall Street estimates, on sales of US$9.73 billion (S$13.1 billion), which is slightly less than forecast. The company said subscriber gains will trail last year's 8.76 million, while analysts forecast 5.18 million.\n\nNetflix's surge in growth has occurred while most of its competitors have slowed down, struggling to attract customers and pay for new shows. The service's share of total TV viewing in the US climbed to more than 8 per cent in the most recent month, more than double any other paid streaming service, according to Nielsen data. Netflix delivered a number of major hits last quarter, including a new season of Bridgerton, the surprise hit Baby Reindeer and the French movie Under Paris.\n\n\"The challenge for so many of our competitors is that while they are investing heavily in premium content, it's generating relatively small viewing on their streaming services,\" the company said.\n\nFor the second quarter, Netflix said, earnings rose 48 per cent to US$4.88 a share, beating estimates of US$4.74. Revenue increased 17 per cent to US$9.6 billion, slightly exceeding projections. It ended the quarter with 277.7 million customers worldwide.\n\nShares of Netflix were down more than 2 per cent in extended trading at 4.22pm in New York. Bullish investors have been pushing the stock back towards the all-time closing high of more than US$690 that they reached in November 2021.\n\nNetflix plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers next year, which many analysts interpreted as a bad sign about their growth going forward.\n\nYet the company, which has added more than 17 million customers this year, struck a confident tone on July 18, raising its full-year estimate for profit margins.\n\nManagement is increasing the company's investment in video games, with plans to release one new title every month. It will make a Squid Game-inspired video game later this year timed to the debut of the second season of that show.

It is all attributed to its anti-password sharing rules within the platform which causes others to leave instead of create a new account if they are not from the same household.\n\nIts famed move was also copied by other streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu, as well as HBO's Max, with others also looking to follow suit.\n\nA new report from LSEG (via Reuters) shared Netflix's latest numbers, and since the first quarter of 2024, the platform's numbers slowed down and dropped significantly. In Q2 2024, Netflix saw 4.82 million subscribers only, and this is less than a third of its numbers in the fourth quarter of 2023 which saw around 15 million new subscribers with its password-sharing crackdown in effect.\n\nThe password-sharing crackdown in 2023 was said to have worked wonders for Netflix when it took effect, and during the start of the second half of last year, the company reported 5.9 million new subscribers.\n\nIts numbers now are unlike its previous achievements in the past because of anti-password sharing, a move that was famously copied by other streaming platforms.\n\nRead Also: Disney Plus Password Sharing Crackdown: When Will It Take Effect?\n\nDespite these low numbers, Netflix was able to overturn this anti-password sharing issue by doubling its advertising revenue in Q2 2024, reaching around $9.53 billion. This is the highest number of its ad revenue since Q2 2021.\n\nThe cheapest ad-supported plan on Netflix costs $6.99 monthly, and its ad-free now starts at $15.49 per month after killing its cheapest plan at $11.99 monthly.\n\nWord behind Netflix's plans to no longer allow users to use one account for different devices first spread in 2022, with it initially coming to Latin America to test among its subscribers. Netflix Peru was the first to adopt this and see it take effect, but the test reportedly 'flopped' among users, leaving them confused with the new policy and seeing chaos amongst subscribers.\n\nHowever, this policy from Netflix continued and started its official rollout among other countries, with the United States seeing this massive focus from the streaming platform. It first started earlier than planned but Netflix said that it is still coming; and later in the year, it took effect among users who share one account, with the app asking them to create their own account if detected to be out of the primary household.\n\nSince that time and earlier this year, Netflix regarded it to be a success, and because of this anti-password sharing rule alone, the company gained more subscribers and reported new record highs. Despite these ecstatic beginnings, Netflix is now facing slow growth in its streaming platform as users opt to unsubscribe instead of creating their account, with the company back to square one.", "source": {"uri": "techtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isaiah_richard@techtimes.com", "name": "Isaiah Richard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_(American_game_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Password (American game show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/442358/820/0/0/0/netflix.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The company made a three-year deal to broadcast the NFL's Christmas Day games. The deal kicks off this year with Netflix globally airing two NFL games on the holiday. In 2025 and 2026, Netflix will stream at least one holiday game.\n\n\"Netflix is now in live sports,\" Nollen said. \"This means Netflix might be the only place you will be able to watch those two Christmas Day games, which could obviously add more subscribers.\"\n\nAiring football games has proven itself to be a winning strategy to juice subscriber numbers: In January, Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service, saw a jump of 2.8 million sign-ups in the three days leading up to its exclusive airing of an NFL playoff game.\n\nThe event was \"the single biggest subscriber acquisition moment ever measured\" by Peacock, according to the company.\n\nMovies & TV 'Shogun' leads all Emmy nominees with 25 and 'The Bear' sets comedy series record with 23 By ANDREW DALTON AP Entertainment Writer\n\nEarlier this year, Netflix also announced another high-profile foray into sports programming: A 10-year deal to air \"WWE Raw\" live, valued at more than $5 billion.\n\nBut sports aren't the only way Netflix is trying to expand its footprint.

Its performance suggests the company maintains its strength against competitors as a result of this strategic change. Netflix's shares remained flat following the earnings report and were up 33% year-to-date at the market close on Thursday.\n\nThe live streamer added eight million new subscribers in the second quarter, bringing its total users to 277.65 million, up 16.5% from the same quarter last year, compared with analysts' forecasts of 274.4 million. The company stated its ad-supported membership grew by 34% from the previous quarter and that it was building an in-house ad tech platform to be tested in Canada this year, with plans for a broader rollout in 2025. By region, paid membership grew the most in the Asia-Pacific region, up by 24% year on year. While the US market remained the biggest contributor to its revenue, users in EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) increased at a faster pace of 17%, making it Netflix's second-largest market in terms of sales.\n\nAmid a sharp slowdown in user growth post-pandemic, Netflix launched a cheaper ad-supported tier late in 2022, aiming to spark new growth. The performance over the past year has proved that this strategic change has been successful. Moving forward, Netflix will no longer report quarterly subscriber numbers starting in 2025. Instead, it will shift its focus from user growth metrics to more traditional indicators such as profit margin and revenue growth.\n\nIn other metrics, overall revenue was recorded at $9.56 billion (\u20ac8.78 billion), rising 17% year on year, surpassing the estimated $9.53 billion (\u20ac8.75 billion). Net income came to $2.15 billion (\u20ac1.97 billion), up 44% from a year ago, with an operating margin of 27.2%, compared with 22.3% in the second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $4.88 (\u20ac4.48), compared to the expected $4.74 (\u20ac4.35). It upgraded its guidance for 2024, expecting revenue to grow by 14% to 15%, up from the previous range of 13% to 15%. The operating margin is expected to be 26% for the whole year, higher than the previous projection of 25%.\n\nHowever, Netflix's guidance for the current quarter falls slightly short of expectations, with a forecast of earnings per share of $5.10 on revenue of $9.73 billion. Nonetheless, its shares reached an all-time high seen in November 2021 on 9 July before pulling back in line with recent trends in the technology sector.\n\nAccording to Nielsen's data, Netflix accounts for an 8.4% share of total US TV viewing time, following YouTube at 9.9% in June. The third-largest streaming service, Amazon's Prime Video, only represented 3.1%. The company attributed its success to premium storytelling series, such as Bridgerton Universe, which generated 172 million views. Additionally, it has diversified its business into the gaming industry over the past three years and added Virgin River and Perfect Match in the second quarter.\n\nThe advertising initiative has been seen as the company's most successful strategic development. The streamer stated that the ad-supported tier fulfilled two important priorities: offering a cheaper price for consumers and generating revenue for the business. In the shareholders' letter, it says: \"Given this sustained progress, we believe that we're on track to achieve critical ad subscriber scale for advertisers in our ad-supported countries by 2025, creating a strong base from which we can further increase our ad membership in 2026 and beyond.\"", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_streamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Online streamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profit margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgin River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/58/74/96/1200x675_cmsv2_d66de52d-0cc9-589a-8209-d4500bf55114-8587496.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 2705, "textEnd": 2711}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

(Image credit: Netflix)\n\nNetflix has revealed that it's in the process of completely overhauling its homepage - a user interface (UI) redesign it claims will be \"our biggest update in a decade\".\n\nAs part of a letter to its shareholders covering its Q2 2024 earnings, the streaming titan revealed it was developing a \"more intuitive TV homepage\" that would make it easier for you and I to find our next favorite movie, TV show, and/or videogame.\n\nNetflix didn't provide any images that tease what the revised homepage will eventually look like, so it's unclear how different it'll be to the one that fans have become accustomed to. The world's best streaming service, though, suggested its homepage refresh will not only make it far easier to find the type of content we enjoy, but also provide more key information to consumers to help them determine whether they should stream it.\n\n\"While our recommendations are widely recognized as industry leading,\" Netflix said. \"We believe we can do much more to improve discovery on Netflix. So, we recently began testing a new, more intuitive TV homepage design, our biggest update in a decade.\n\n\"This new interface provides more visible title information at a glance - including synopsis, genre, and ratings. Title previews are also larger and more dynamic, with more immersive trailers and bigger box art to make browsing easier. We've also simplified the navigation bar and moved it to the top of the page to create quicker, easier short cuts. And this new design includes 'My Netflix', which has everything members have saved or watched and was previously only available on mobile. As always, with any changes to our product, we'll listen to the feedback, learn and continue to improve the experience over time.\"\n\nNetflix's homepage redesign announcement comes as the streaming giant celebrates plenty of big wins heading into the second half of 2024.\n\nIn its latest earnings report, Netflix confirmed it added 8.05 million more subscribers to its global userbase in the three-month period running from April to June; a figure that takes its total subscriber count to 277.65 million. That means the streamer has added over 40 million new users since Q2 2023, the vast majority of whom have signed up to its cheapest, ad-supported tier. On the monetary front, Netflix is also popping the champagne corks, with its $2.4 billion operating income for Q2 2024 representing a 42% increase on the same period last year.\n\nSo, what's driven Netflix's success over the past 12 months? For one, Netflix ditched its cheapest ad-free plan in January, meaning new and returning customers - those operating on a budget, anyway - are forced to sign up to its new ad-supported Basic tier to the tune of $6.99 / \u00a34.99 / AU$7.99 per month. The annual price hikes that Netflix and its competitors continue to drop on consumers - you should brace yourself for another price increase later this year, according to industry analysts - have given rise to sharp jumps in Netflix's profit margins, too.\n\nOf course, Netflix will - rightly, in some cases - point to the popularity of its exclusive movie and TV show range as a major reason for its ongoing success. In its letter to shareholders, the streamer boasted about the wild success that Baby Reindeer and season 3 of Bridgerton had achieved, with two of the best Netflix shows drawing in hundreds of millions of viewers following their releases earlier this year. The same is true of some unexpected hits from Netflix's 2024 Original Movie back catalog, too, with the Jaws-inspired shark horror flick Under Paris racking up nearly 91 million views to become Netflix's third most-popular non-English movie of all-time. Clearly, I should think about adding it to our best Netflix movies guide.\n\nBut I digress. Yes, Netflix can boast about the performance of numerous originals and, without them, audiences wouldn't have anything to watch on the service, which would lead them to shuttering their accounts. There's no denying, though, that the streamer's decision to funnel users onto its cheapest tier - one with inescapable ad breaks - or its increasingly expensive Standard and Premium Tiers has also been vital to the platform overcoming its 2023 financial and subscriber loss woes.\n\nThe good times won't last forever, with Netflix admitting that it expects subscriber growth to slow in Q3 2024. But, as the streamer extends its seemingly insurmountable subscriber lead on its competitors - Disney Plus, its nearest rival, only has 153.6 million as of March 2024 - Netflix is the undisputed number one streaming service around. Regardless of whether people love or hate its forthcoming homepage redesign, then, it can be confident that fans will stick around for the long haul.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_power@techradar.com", "name": "Tom Power", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "User interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wPVEnoqRAzoVxUXvk4TMeR-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Netflix's stock has been uplifted in recent quarters by its push to gain subscribers on its cheaper, ad-supported tier, in addition to its crackdown on password sharing.\n\nThe company has also begun adding live sports, such as NFL games on Christmas Day over the next three years, a move that will likely attract more ad dollars for the streamer.\n\nNetflix had roughly 270 million global subscribers at the end of the first quarter, up 16% from the same period in year prior and surpassing expectations.\n\nWhen Netflix made its pitch to advertisers during its Upfront presentation in May, the company said its ad-supported tier had amassed 40 million global monthly active users, nearly double the figure it had shared months earlier.\n\nLast quarter Netflix warned investors it would stop providing quarterly membership numbers or average revenue per user beginning next year, noting the company is \"focused on revenue and operating margin as our primary financial metrics -- and engagement (i.e. time spent) as our best proxy for customer satisfaction.\"\n\nThis decision showcases Netflix's \"pivot from a high-growth, low-profit business to a slow-growth, high-profit business,\" according to an analyst note from Wedbush last week. However, the note emphasizes that although Netflix has a big lead ahead of its competitors when it comes to the streaming business, that pivot \"is far from complete.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lillian_rizzo@cnbc.com", "name": "Lillian Rizzo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Active users"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy server"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_satisfaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer satisfaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upfront_(advertising)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upfront (advertising)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home_Based", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home Based", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107364079-1706129708707-gettyimages-1958240279-mt2_9014_fgbxpegk.jpeg?v=1721162888&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The company reported a net income of $2.15 billion, up from $1.49 billion a year ago.\n\nNetflix introduced a new, user-friendly TV homepage in June to enhance content discovery. Progress in scaling the ad business includes a 34% growth in ad tier memberships. The company is developing an in-house ad tech platform scheduled for testing in Canada in 2024 and a broader launch in 2025.\n\n\"We're pleased with our performance in Q2, there was a strong performance across the board, good momentum across the business, strong revenue growth, member growth, and profit growth,\" Netflix CFO Spencer Neumann said during the earnings call. \"We're targeting 26% full-year income margin, up five percentage points year over year. We're committed to growing margins each year.\"\n\nKey initiatives include enhancing user experience and content offerings to better serve members. Q2 featured popular series like \"Bridgerton S3,\" \"Baby Reindeer,\" \"Queen of Tears,\" and \"The Great Indian Kapil Show,\" alongside hit films such as \"Under Paris,\" \"Atlas and Hit Man,\" and \"The Roast of Tom Brady,\" attracting record live audiences.\n\nNetflix introduced its ad-supported tier in late 2022 and has incrementally revealed its performance metrics. Advertising now plays a pivotal role in enhancing streaming profitability, bolstering Netflix's stock amid initiatives to grow its ad-supported subscriber base and mitigate password sharing.\n\nThe inclusion of live sports events, such as NFL games on Christmas Day, is designed to further increase ad revenue. Despite reaching about 270 million global subscribers by Q1, Netflix is pivoting its focus from growth metrics to emphasize revenue and operating margin, signaling a strategic shift toward greater profitability.\n\n\"We're very pleased with how we're scaling our ads business,\" Neumann said. \"The revenue portion of ads is growing nicely.\"\n\nNeumann said it will take time to scale the ads business, but it should be more of a prominent revenue driver by 2026, adding, \"We're scaling well through reach, through engagement, through growing inventory and that represents opportunity for us over a multiyear trajectory to have a big and increasing revenue and profit impact on the business.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Netflix officials anticipate a 14% year-over-year increase in revenue for Q3, and for the full year 2024, they forecast a range of 14% to 15%, up from previous estimates of 13% to 15%.\n\n\"This adjustment reflects strong membership growth trends and positive business momentum, partially offset by the U.S. dollar's strength relative to other currencies,\" according to the shareholder letter.\n\nCo-CEO Greg Peters noted that improving the overall member experience is an ongoing process at Netflix.\n\n\"So, we're constantly prioritizing all those opportunities based on what we think is the expected value,\" he said. \"To give you a sense of how wide that is, even things that we've been working on for over a decade, like our signup flows, the user experience that a consumer has when they want to sign up for Netflix, we have found multiple improvements just over the last couple of quarters in those flows which have delivered material incremental revenue wins.\"", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [],

Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $4.76 per share.\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Netflix has missed Wall Street's revenue estimates four times over the last two years.\n\nWith Netflix being the first among its peers to report earnings this season, we don't have anywhere else to look to get a hint at how this quarter will unravel for consumer internet stocks. However, there has been positive investor sentiment in the segment, with share prices up 6.7% on average over the last month.

The most reasonable logic behind this sudden dip in subscribers is the strict crackdown on password-sharing and the shift of viewers' attention from Netflix to summer sporting events such as the Euro soccer tournament. According to LSEG data, Netflix registered around 4.82 million new subscribers in the second quarter. This is the lowest addition since the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAccording to Nielsen data, Netflix's original series like the historical romance \"Bridgerton\" and the limited series \"Baby Reindeer,\" which delves into comedian Richard Gadd's encounter with a stalker, dominated the most-watched charts in the second quarter.\n\nThe streaming giant has been working hard to sell its lower-priced ad-supported tier and it will be safe to say that it has yielded strong ad revenue growth. As per reports, the ad revenue of the company is likely to have more than doubled in the June quarter. If we talk about the overall revenue, then it has likely risen 16.4 per cent to $9.53 billion. This marks the fastest growth since the second quarter of 2021.\n\nInvestors are keenly awaiting Netflix's second-quarter results, particularly focusing on its efforts to expand the ad-supported plan and seeking updates on new growth initiatives. In May, Netflix announced that its ad-supported tier had reached 40 million monthly active users worldwide, accounting for 40% of all sign-ups in available countries -- a substantial increase from 23 million in January.\n\nThe market has responded positively to Netflix's advertising strategy, reflected in the company's stock rising nearly 35% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500 index's return of about 19%. However, analysts anticipate a potential impact on summer viewership trends as people engage in travel activities, compounded by the Olympic Games starting on July 26, which could draw viewers away from streaming services like Netflix.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aashish_kumar_shrivastava@news.abplive.com", "name": "Aashish Kumar Shrivastava", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Reindeer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baby Reindeer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_series_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Limited series (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_romance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Historical romance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gadd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gadd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/07/19/6be3bdb5280af637a0770509ebf8d8d31721389792867555_original.png?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 2149, "textEnd": 2156}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

This number is accelerating, with the first quarter of 2024 coming in at 40% compared to Q4 2023 (32%) and Q3 2023 (30%).\n\nNetflix said it added 8.1 million worldwide subscribers in the second quarter -- down from 9.3 million additions in the first quarter. Year over year, global streaming memberships grew 17% to 277.7 million.\n\nWhile it didn't go into specifics of advertising revenue, it didn't offer up average revenue per user (ARPU) results. In the U.S/Canada ARPU was $17.17; in Europe, $10.80; Latin America, $8.28; and Asia-Pacific, $7.17.\n\nNetflix says U.S./Canada subscribers rose by 1.5 million in the second quarter, now totaling 84.1 million. Rough estimates suggest around half of that 1.5 million gain in the second quarter was for its advertising tier.\n\nNetflix will launch its own in-house ad tech platform in 2025. Programmatically, Netflix will expand its ad inventory access to demand-side and supply-side platforms including The Trade Desk, Google DV 360, and Magnite.\n\nOverall revenue climbed 17% to $9.6 billion, with net income at $2.1 billion.

However, it's noteworthy that Netflix added 9.32 million subscribers during Q1 which blasted expectations of 5.73 million (Surprise of 3.59 million) and climbed from 1.75 million additions in the comparative quarter.\n\nTaking advantage of its subscriber growth, Netflix's Q2 sales are projected to rise 16% to $9.53 billion. Even better, earnings are expected to soar 43% to $4.70 per share versus $3.29 a share in Q2 2023.\n\nNotably, Netflix has exceeded earnings expectations in three of its last four quarterly reports posting an average earnings surprise of 9.26%.\n\nCorrelating with its expansion, Netflix shares have become more reasonably valued trading at 35.8X forward earnings compared to its five-year high of 108.3X while offering a slight discount to the median of 40.6X.\n\nConsidering its more reasonable P/E valuation now looks like an advantageous time to invest in Netflix's monstrous growth. Furthermore, NFLX tends to spike when Netflix beats earnings expectations but would be a viable buy-the-dip candidate on a selloff as an intriguing investment for 2024 and beyond.\n\nIt's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\n\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Netflix's net income also increase to $2.14bn, compared to $1.48bn last year.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's paid subscriber count grew by more than 8m, representing strong year-over-year growth of 16.5pc. This result follows a strong start to 2024, as Netflix saw significant growth to its profit and subscriber count earlier this year.\n\nThe streaming service has had a number of unique changes in recent years that were intended to boost revenue and subscriber figures. One of these was a crackdown on people sharing accounts between multiple households - which Netflix focused on after a record subscriber loss in one quarter of 2022.\n\nNetflix also launched a cheaper ad-supported subscription option in various countries in order to draw in more users. The streaming giant was against the idea of adverts on its service for years, but had a change of heart in 2022 after it lost subscribers for the first time in a decade.\n\nThe company appears to be focusing more on ads as it is phasing out its cheapest ad-free option - its Basic plan - in various countries that have the ad-supported option available.\n\nThis Basic plan has been phased out in the UK and Canada - meaning users have to choose between the cheaper Standard with ads subscription or a much pricier Standard subscription. Netflix is also planning to phase out the Basic plan in the US and France.\n\n\"We believe that we're on track to achieve critical ad subscriber scale for advertisers in our ad countries in 2025, creating a strong base from which we can further increase our ad membership in 2026 and beyond,\" Netflix said in a statement. \"Our ad revenue is growing nicely and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to our business.\n\n\"But building a business from scratch takes time - and coupled with the large size of our subscription revenue - we don't expect advertising to be a primary driver of our revenue growth in 2024 or 2025.\"\n\nForrester VP and research director Mike Proulx said Netflix's commitment to advertising is \"just beginning to show signs of scaling, meaning it's headed in the right direction\".\n\n\"That's notable because ad revenue is a critical component to Netflix's go-forward growth calculus,\" Proulx said. \"It's because the company can't rely on net paid subscriptions alone as the primary contributor to revenue growth because they aren't trending upward.\"\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

In 2025 and 2026, Netflix will stream at least one holiday game.\n\n\"Netflix is now in live sports,\" Nollen said. \"This means Netflix might be the only place you will be able to watch those two Christmas Day games, which could obviously add more subscribers.\"\n\nAiring football games has proven itself to be a winning strategy to juice subscriber numbers: In January, Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service, saw a jump of 2.8 million sign-ups in the three days leading up to its exclusive airing of an NFL playoff game.\n\nThe event was \"the single biggest subscriber acquisition moment ever measured\" by Peacock, according to the company.\n\nMovies & TV 'Shogun' leads all Emmy nominees with 25 and 'The Bear' sets comedy series record with 23 By ANDREW DALTON AP Entertainment Writer\n\nEarlier this year, Netflix also announced another high-profile foray into sports programming: A 10-year deal to air \"WWE Raw\" live, valued at more than $5 billion.\n\nBut sports aren't the only way Netflix is trying to expand its footprint. Last month, the company said it plans to open two massive entertainment venues called Netflix Houses.\n\nThe \"experiential\" complexes, in former department store locations at Dallas Galleria and King of Prussia mall (near Philadelphia), will each span more than 100,000 square feet and include events, themed gift shops and restaurants. Both will open in 2025.\n\nWhile these complexes don't quite reach the scale or footprint of Disney's or Universal's global theme parks, David Joyce, an analyst at Seaport, said the complexes are designed to drive brand loyalty.\n\n\"It should help retain those customers and keep them in the Netflix ecosystem and paying for their subscriptions for longer,\" he said.\n\nNetflix cancels cheapest plan as subscribers have to choose Narrower choices\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

To sustain its momentum, the company plans to expand its entertainment offerings and continue investing in its ad-supported tier, which saw a 34% growth this quarter.\n\nDespite the strong quarterly performance, Netflix shares remained flat following the announcement but have experienced a 37% increase year-to-date.\n\nThe company's ability to consistently exceed subscriber growth estimates highlights its resilience and adaptability in a competitive streaming landscape, positioning it well for continued success in the future.\n\nIn Nigeria, Netflix wields its influence on the streaming market year it premiered its original series \"\u00d2l\u00f2t\u016br\u00e9: The Journey,\" a spinoff from the 2019 film by Mo Abudu's EbonyLife Studios.

These nominations span across 35 series, TV movies, and specials. In Q2, Netflix premiered a diverse array of hit series including \"Bridgerton\" Season 3, \"Baby Reindeer,\" \"Queen of Tears,\" and \"The Great Indian Kapil Show.\" \"The Roast of Tom Brady\" attracted Netflix's largest live audience to date, with 22.6 million views from its May 5 premiere through July 14.\n\nThe company announced it is exploring new areas such as sports, live events, and gaming to extend its lead in the industry.

How to Get Rid of Ads on Netflix?", "body": "Have you noticed some commercials or promos playing before your Netflix shows start? More people are wondering - does Netflix have ads now? It can be frustrating to see ads after paying a monthly fee. In this post, we'll look at whether Netflix really has commercials and some tips to avoid them.\n\nSome reports say Netflix is testing short promos on their service. But the good news is they are not full commercial breaks like traditional TV. Netflix promos only last 30 seconds and promote their shows. So, it's not the same as interrupted viewing with long ads. Let's find out more about Netflix ads and how to get rid of ads on Netflix.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPart 1: Does Netflix Have Ads?\n\nPart 2: How to Watch Netflix Without Ads Officially?\n\nPart 3: How to Get Rid of Ads on Netflix with CleverGet Netflix Downloader?\n\nPart 4: FAQs\n\nPart 5: Conclusion\n\nDoes Netflix Have Ads?\n\nMany people wonder - does Netflix have commercials like regular TV? The answer is kind of complicated. Netflix does not have long commercial breaks interrupting your show. But they do test short promos sometimes. These promotions are usually only 30 seconds or less.\n\nThe promos will suggest other Netflix shows or movies you might enjoy. They only want you to watch more on their service. Promos mainly happen if you pause a show for a while or finish one program and click the next. Sometimes there may be a promo when you first start the app too.\n\nBut Netflix says some members don't see any promos at all. And you may avoid them if you don't pause. Just let the next episode play straight through. Some other streaming services do have ads for other companies. But for now, Netflix keeps it short and only about their content. So, the answer is Netflix does not have traditional long commercials, but a short promo here and there may play depending on how you use Netflix.\n\nHow to Watch Netflix Without Ads Officially?\n\nNetflix offers different subscription plans. The basic ones may soon show short ads before shows. You cannot skip or fast-forward through ads, but you can avoid all ads by upgrading to their \"Standard\" or \"Premium\" plans. These cost more but let you watch any show non-stop without interruptions. The Standard plan is $15.49 monthly. Premium is $22.99 per month. It is noted that Netflix discontinued the Basic with no ads plan for new or renewed subscribers.\n\nHow to Get Rid of Ads on Netflix with CleverGet Netflix Downloader?\n\nTired of ads interrupting your Netflix binges?

Netflix guided to third quarter EPS of $5.10, ahead of consensus calls for $4.74.\n\nSubscribers also came in strong with another 8 million-plus users added on the heels of key programming, such as the latest season of \"Bridgerton.\"\n\nSubscriber additions of 8.05 million beat expectations of 4.7 million and follows the 9.3 million net additions the streamer added in the first quarter. The company had added 5.9 million paying users in Q2 2023.\n\nLeading up to the earnings release, Netflix's stock has been on a tear with shares are up more than 30% since the start of the year.\n\nIn May, Netflix announced it won the streaming rights to two NFL games set to air on Christmas Day as part of a three-season deal. The company also told advertisers at its May Upfront presentation that its ad tier has reached 40 million global monthly active users -- a significant jump from the 15 million users the company revealed back in November and a 35 million-user increase compared to the year-ago period.\n\nThe growth comes as the streamer has raised the prices of its ad-free subscriptions in an attempt to lure more users to its ad-supported offering. Netflix's password-sharing crackdown has also lifted top-line growth and increased the platform's overall subscriber base.\n\nBut it hasn't been an entirely smooth trajectory upward. In April, Netflix said it would stop reporting subscriber figures, along with a key profitability metric, average revenue per member, or ARM, beginning next year.\n\nThat's raised concerns about the company's long-term subscriber growth and whether or not recent growth momentum can be sustained over the long term.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Even better, earnings are expected to soar 43% to $4.70 per share versus $3.29 a share in Q2 2023.\n\nNotably, Netflix has exceeded earnings expectations in three of its last four quarterly reports posting an average earnings surprise of 9.26%.\n\nMonitoring Netflix's P/E Valuation\n\nCorrelating with its expansion, Netflix shares have become more reasonably valued trading at 35.8X forward earnings compared to its five-year high of 108.3X while offering a slight discount to the median of 40.6X.\n\nBottom Line\n\nConsidering its more reasonable P/E valuation now looks like an advantageous time to invest in Netflix's monstrous growth. Furthermore, NFLX tends to spike when Netflix beats earnings expectations but would be a viable buy-the-dip candidate on a selloff as an intriguing investment for 2024 and beyond.\n\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\n\nIt's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\n\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Discovery, CNN's parent company), fueled in part by the company's recent effort to push users who share passwords to create their own accounts.\n\nHowever, the short-term subscriber jolt from the password-sharing crackdown could soon fade.

The company made a three-year deal to broadcast the NFL's Christmas Day games. The deal kicks off this year with Netflix globally airing two NFL games on the holiday. In 2025 and 2026, Netflix will stream at least one holiday game.\n\n\"Netflix is now in live sports,\" Nollen said. \"This means Netflix might be the only place you will be able to watch those two Christmas Day games, which could obviously add more subscribers.\"\n\nAiring football games has proven itself to be a winning strategy to juice subscriber numbers: In January, Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service, saw a jump of 2.8 million sign-ups in the three days leading up to its exclusive airing of an NFL playoff game.\n\nThe event was \"the single biggest subscriber acquisition moment ever measured\" by Peacock, according to the company.\n\nNation & World 'Shogun' leads all Emmy nominees with 25 and 'The Bear' sets comedy series record with 23 By ANDREW DALTON AP Entertainment Writer\n\nEarlier this year, Netflix also announced another high-profile foray into sports programming: A 10-year deal to air \"WWE Raw\" live, valued at more than $5 billion.\n\nBut sports aren't the only way Netflix is trying to expand its footprint. Last month, the company said it plans to open two massive entertainment venues called Netflix Houses.\n\nThe \"experiential\" complexes, in former department store locations at Dallas Galleria and King of Prussia mall (near Philadelphia), will each span more than 100,000 square feet and include events, themed gift shops and restaurants. Both will open in 2025.\n\nWhile these complexes don't quite reach the scale or footprint of Disney's or Universal's global theme parks, David Joyce, an analyst at Seaport, said the complexes are designed to drive brand loyalty.\n\n\"It should help retain those customers and keep them in the Netflix ecosystem and paying for their subscriptions for longer,\" he said.\n\nNetflix cancels cheapest plan as subscribers have to choose Narrower choices\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

And it might be one of the last times this info is shared by the streamer, which announced last quarter that it will stop reporting subscriber totals and average revenue per user beginning in 2025 -- opting to focus instead on overall revenue and operating margin as its primary financial metrics, as well as tracking engagement (time spent by viewers on the platform).\n\nNetflix's ad tier membership grew by 34% between Q1 and Q2, putting the company \"on track to achieve critical ad subscriber scale for advertisers in 2025,\" according to a shareholders letter that also noted the importance of a new in-house ad tech platform that will be tested in Canada later this year and more widely in 2025.\n\nInterestingly, Netflix also revealed that VP of ad sales Peter Naylor is exiting the company that he joined in August 2022. The streamer is looking to hire an ad sales chief for the US and Canada in lieu of filling Naylor's more globally-focused position.\n\nNetflix said that \"building a business from scratch takes time -- and coupled with the large size of our subscription revenue -- we don't expect advertising to be a primary driver of our revenue growth in 2024 or 2025. The near-term challenge (and medium-term opportunity) is that we're scaling faster than our ability to monetize our growing ad inventory.\"\n\nElsewhere in its report, the company stressed that it won't bundle its service with a streaming competitor like Disney+ or Max because Netflix \"already operates as a go-to destination for entertainment, thanks to the breadth and variety of our slate and superior product experience.\"\n\nIt also cited Nielsen's The Gauge, which has reported that streaming currently accounts for 40% of total TV watch time in the US, with top performer YouTube taking a 9.9% share of the streaming pie, and Netflix close behind at 8.4%.\n\n\"The challenge for so many of our competitors is that while they are investing heavily in premium content, it's generating relatively small viewing on their streaming services, and linear continues to decline,\" the company noted.\n\nLooking ahead, \"our biggest opportunity is winning a larger share of the 80%+ of TV time (primarily linear and streaming) that neither Netflix nor YouTube has today.\"", "source": {"uri": "kidscreen.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kidscreen"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_dickson@kidscreen.com", "name": "Jeremy Dickson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_streamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online streamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://cdn.kidscreen.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Untitled-design-9-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Revenue grew 17% during the quarter, reaching $9.5bn.\n\nThe company said the revenue growth was driven primarily by an increase in paid memberships.\n\n\"We're making steady progress scaling our ads business,\" the company wrote in a letter to shareholders, adding that it saw a 34% growth since last quarter in new ad-tier subscribers.\n\nNetflix noted that the UK and India had especially strong viewership slates this year, noting that 88.4 million viewers streamed Baby Reindeer.\n\nThe company has spent the last few years trying to maintain the momentum it gained during the height of the pandemic, when people were streaming more to get through quarantine.

This slowdown is largely due to diminishing returns from its password-sharing crackdown and distractions from major summer events like the Euro soccer tournament. However, it's not all bad news: Netflix's ad-supported tier has likely sparked a significant boost in ad revenue, which probably more than doubled this quarter. The company expects an overall revenue increase of 16.4%, hitting $9.53 billion - the fastest growth since mid-2021.\n\nDespite fewer new subscribers, Netflix's ad-supported tier is showing promise. The company reported 40 million monthly active users for this tier by May, up from 23 million in January, accounting for 40% of all new sign-ups in the countries where it's available. This has helped push Netflix's stock up nearly 35% this year, outperforming the S&P 500's 19% gain. Investors should watch how well Netflix can maintain ad revenue growth, especially as live events such as Christmas Day NFL games are introduced to attract more advertisers.\n\nThe bigger picture: Content and collaborations drive growth.\n\nNetflix's strategy extends beyond new subscribers, focusing on original hits like 'Bridgerton' and 'Baby Reindeer', which topped Q2 viewership charts. Still, most of Netflix's top-streamed titles are acquired shows like 'NCIS' and 'Grey's Anatomy,' which consistently draw viewers. The platform's collaborations, such as bundling with Comcast's Xfinity, Peacock, and Apple TV+, are strategic moves to broaden its reach. With the Olympics around the corner, analysts will pay close attention to how Netflix balances its content strategy with the growing competition and the potential of its ad-supported model to drive future growth.", "source": {"uri": "finimize.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finimize"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Active users"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfinity", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xfinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Product bundling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey's_Anatomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grey's Anatomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCIS (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdefault_prefix-img-3MVMbY70khmHBXss4U4PfREp.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=abb4723162d43cae9ec8124cff811749", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, its ad tier continues to gain traction. Shares have soared as a result, with the stock up about 35% since the start of the year.\n\nAs of Thursday's close, Netflix was trading at around $656 a share. Shares closed at a record high of $691.69 on Nov. 17, 2021.\n\nBut the stock's recent run-up has led to some apprehension on Wall Street.\n\n\"We are cautious heading into the firm's Q2 2024 release,\" Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote. \"We maintain our Neutral rating and $660 target price.\"\n\nHere's what Wall Street expects from the report, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates:\n\nIn May, Netflix announced it won the streaming rights to two NFL games set to air on Christmas Day as part of a three-season deal. The company also told advertisers at its May Upfront presentation that its ad tier has reached 40 million global monthly active users -- a significant jump from the 15 million users the company revealed back in November and a 35 million-user increase compared to the year-ago period.\n\nThe growth comes as the streamer has raised the prices of its ad-free subscriptions in an attempt to lure more users to its ad-supported offering. Netflix's password-sharing crackdown has also lifted top-line growth and increased the platform's overall subscriber base, with another 9 million-plus users added in the first quarter.\n\nBut it hasn't been an entirely smooth trajectory upward. In April, Netflix said it would stop reporting subscriber figures at the start of next year, raising concerns about its long-term subscriber growth and sending shares tumbling.\n\nNetflix also has \"larger competitors to consider especially as its own business matures over the next few years,\" warned Swinburne. \"The obvious examples are Alphabet's YouTube and Amazon's Prime Video. Perhaps less obvious are other sources of consumer time like social media, which is increasingly populated by short-form video.\"\n\n\"Finally, there is the long-term risk that as its own margins build through outsized returns, [a new army] or many may assemble,\" he said. \"The potential for AI tools to dramatically reduce the barriers to entry in premium, professional video come to mind in this regard.\"\n\nAnd although the ad tier has enjoyed early success, analysts have warned the initiative still has a long way to go. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said her team views advertising \"as a longer-term story and [does] not expect a material revenue contribution until 2025.\"\n\nShe cited the glut of new inventory with the launch of several competitor ad-supported services, along with \"the backdrop of a mixed advertising environment.\" Still, the analyst reiterated her Buy rating and increased her price target to $740 a share, up from the prior $700.\n\n\"We raise our target multiple to reflect continued momentum in the underlying business,\" she said. \"Supported by its world-class brand, leading global subscriber base, position as an innovator and increased visibility in growth drivers, we believe that Netflix should continue to outperform.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Jefferies analyst James Heaney, who increased his target to $780 from $655 this week, said Netflix is well placed to beat on subscriber numbers because of content like Bridgerton and NFL games, as well as its success in converting viewers who were sharing passwords.\n\nHanna Howard, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, is also optimistic. \"Netflix is still really in a league of its own, especially on the strength of its international content and depth of consumption,\" she said. While expectations are high, there's still an opportunity for Netflix to outperform, she added.\n\nOn average, Wall Street analysts are forecasting second-quarter subscriber additions of about 4.9 million. That would follow estimate-trouncing additions of more than 9 million users in the first quarter. Netflix warned at the time that subscriber growth will likely be lower this quarter due to typical seasonality and said it plans to stop reporting the metric in 2025.\n\nSome see that consensus as easily beatable. Morgan Stanley's Benjamin Swinburne expects additions to come in at 7 million for the quarter and more than 30 million this year. \"Strong core execution, paid sharing and ad tiers that help penetrate more price sensitive cohorts are contributing to a potential record net adds year,\" he wrote, referring to the firm's new, cheaper, advertising-supported service. Swinburne raised his price target to $780 and has a bull case on the stock of $950.\n\nAnother solid quarter could finally allow Netflix shares to hit their first all-time high since 2021 and fully rebound from a rout in 2022. The stock is currently about 7% below its closing record, with options data signaling an implied one-day move -- in either direction -- of nearly 9%.\n\n\"For a trader this is a wait-and-see event,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \"If it gaps up and holds, then it's probably going to continue to trend higher over the next three months.\"\n\nStill, not all bulls believe Netflix can deliver against high expectations.\n\n\"The bar is high, and while we're long-term NFLX bulls, we'd be cautious going into this print,\" Evercore ISI analysts led by Mark Mahaney wrote, noting that the second quarter is typically slower. He added that while Bridgerton was a standout, the rest of Netflix's content slate in the quarter was \"uneventful.\"\n\nMahaney, who has an outperform rating on the shares, also said that Netflix's valuation is elevated at about 32 times forward earnings.\n\nBullish investors will also need to refocus their investment cases after Netflix stops reporting subscriber numbers in a couple of quarters. That metric has been key for most of the company's existence, but the streaming giant now has a greater emphasis on making more money from existing subscribers, and wants analysts to focus primarily on revenue and profit.\n\nThat change did not go down well when it was announced in April, but the company's overall trajectory over the past two years has been one of a big comeback. Netflix suffered the worst six-month stretch in its history during the first half of 2022 -- losing customers, which forced it to lay off hundreds of employees and cut back on programming. The company responded with its password-sharing crackdown and is also trying to push into selling ads and making video games.\n\nRead: Netflix Co-CEO's Password-Sharing Crackdown Fueled Comeback\n\n\"Netflix is in a unique spot here, as is the setup\" going into earnings, said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. Part of the company's narrative has been its recovery since 2022, he said.\n\n\"This reacceleration of the fundamentals has been a really good story and the stocks follow through on that.\"\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. shares have rallied almost 19% this year as Wall Street turns bullish on the technology behemoth's upcoming artificial intelligence features. The iPhone maker's shares are trading at record levels as the rally also pulls its valuation higher. The shares trade at about 32 times forward earnings, hovering at their highest since 2021.\n\nTop Tech Stories", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Per one source, advertising grew 70%, 70% and 65% sequentially the last three quarters respectively.\n\nWith the Q1 '24 revenue guidance, management expected in-line revenue versus consensus in Q2 '24 and a slightly-lower operating margin than Q1 '24's 28%.\n\nNetflix guided to 13% - 15% revenue growth in for full-year '24, which is also slightly conservative to consensus which stands today at an expected 15%.\n\nThe trends in EPS estimates are quite positive, and to a much higher magnitude than revenue estimates, and that's because of NFLX's operating margin increase.\n\nNetflix (the stock bottomed in May '22 at $162 per share, here's the change in NFLX's operating margin since Q2 '22:\n\nTo be clear for readers, Netflix is a growth stock, and it sports a growth stock valuation:\n\nAt $656 dollars per share, (Tuesday night's close), Netflix is trading at 36x times '24 EPS of $18.43, with 43% EPS growth expected this year. Over the next three years looking at the average PE and growth rate, NFLX is trading at 29x earnings for an expected 31% growth rate in the next three years (through '26).\n\nRevenue growth is expected at 15% in '24, and then average 13% over the next 3 years.\n\nPrice-to-cash-flow and free-cash-flow (FCF) is inline with the PE multiple at 33x and 35x.\n\nCash-flow and free-cash-flow have improved dramatically, since the stock bottomed in mid-'22. trailing twelve month (TTM) cash flow is $7.3 billion and TTM FCF is $6.9 billion, TTM capex as averaged around $500 million per quarter the last 12 quarters.\n\nHere's what interesting about NFLX's valuation relative to it's peak on November '21:\n\nMorningstar's fair value estimate for NFLX is $440, very close to it's current 200-week moving average of $447 - $450.\n\n$700 is a big level for Netflix as that price level was the mid-November '21 high before the stock fell to $162 by mid-2022.\n\nA higher-volume breakout above $700 on Netflix (if and when it happens) will be a significant move for the stock.\n\nBreakout or breakdown (in the stock) ? As the old country lawyer said, \"I can argue it either way\".\n\nAlthough growth and momentum stocks need a break in this market environment, the fact is after writing this preview, I remain more positive than the negative on NFLX's longer-term outlook, as they branch out into advertising and look to turn subscribers into higher average revenue per member.\n\nThe US and Canadian markets are thought to be saturated, while the growth is in Europe and non-US markets. Netflix did announce this quarter they have 270 paid subscribers and they could likely get that to 500 by tweaking the model.\n\nHowever, the momentum in EPS and revenue estimates, and NFLX's changing business model to include live sporting events, is (in my opinion) quite important. Netflix announced during the 2nd quarter that they will be carrying two live NFL games on Christmas Day '24, which will likely only help advertising.\n\nHowever, maybe the most compelling argument to own Netflix was Bob Iger's May 7th statement, calling Netflix \"the gold standard\" in streaming, which says something, coming from one of your closest competitors.\n\nPersonally I've always judged Netflix based on what's available on a nightly basis. I thoroughly enjoyed the Tour De France (TDF) documentary that covered the 2022 and then 2023 TDF. As a weekend biker it was fascinating to learn the different strategies employed within the peleton and the breakaways, and the detail of the sport.\n\nThe 200-week moving average for NFLX (the stock) is $447 - $450 area. That's a price level where more would be bought for client accounts.\n\nThe stock could correct on a tech and growth / momentum pullback, but buy the business, not the stock.\n\nClients currently own a 1.5% position in the stock, and the goal is to own more on a healthy pullback.\n\nNetflix has a substantial first-mover advantage, and while Disney was supposed to be a threat to Netflix a few years ago, with their substantial content library, they have not moved the needle against Netflix.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Operating margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Growth stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niche_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Niche market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physical education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fair value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-mover_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First-mover advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_saturation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market saturation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tour de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-07", "textStart": 3493, "textEnd": 3500}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-07-", "textStart": 104, "textEnd": 111}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

On the other hand, the company expects next quarter's revenue to be around $9.73 billion, slightly below analysts' estimates. It made a GAAP profit of $4.88 per share, improving from its profit of $3.29 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Netflix? Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nLaunched by Reed Hastings as a DVD mail rental company until its famous pivot to streaming in 2007, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) is a pioneering streaming content platform.\n\nConsumers today expect goods and services to be hyper-personalized and on demand. Whether it be what music they listen to, what movie they watch, or even finding a date, online consumer businesses are expected to delight their customers with simple user interfaces that magically fulfill demand. Subscription models have further increased usage and stickiness of many online consumer services.\n\nNetflix's revenue growth over the last three years has been unremarkable, averaging 9.7% annually. This quarter, Netflix reported 16.8% year-on-year revenue growth, in line with analysts' expectations.\n\nGuidance for the next quarter indicates Netflix is expecting revenue to grow 13.9% year on year to $9.73 billion, improving from the 7.8% year-on-year increase it recorded in the comparable quarter last year. Ahead of the earnings results, analysts were projecting sales to grow 13.1% over the next 12 months.\n\nToday's young investors won't have read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nAs a subscription-based app, Netflix generates revenue growth by expanding both its subscriber base and the amount each subscriber spends over time.\n\nOver the last two years, Netflix's users, a key performance metric for the company, grew 9.7% annually to 277.7 million. This is decent growth for a consumer internet company.\n\nIn Q2, Netflix added 39.26 million users, translating into 16.5% year-on-year growth.\n\nAverage revenue per user (ARPU) is a critical metric to track for consumer internet businesses like Netflix because it measures how much the average user spends. ARPU is also a key indicator of how valuable its users are (and can be over time).\n\nNetflix's ARPU has declined over the last two years, averaging 1.3%. Although the company's users have continued to grow, it's lost its pricing power and will have to make improvements soon. This quarter, ARPU grew 0.2% year on year to $34.43 per user.\n\nIt was great to see Netflix increase its users this quarter, enabling it to beat Wall Street's revenue, operating margin, and EPS estimates. We were also glad its full-year EPS guidance topped expectations, but its quarterly and full-year revenue outlook fell short. The forecasted top-line metrics were ultimately what the market cared more about, so this was a tough quarter for Netflix.

In 2025 and 2026, Netflix will stream at least one holiday game.\n\n\"Netflix is now in live sports,\" Nollen said. \"This means Netflix might be the only place you will be able to watch those two Christmas Day games, which could obviously add more subscribers.\"\n\nAiring football games has proven itself to be a winning strategy to juice subscriber numbers: In January, Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service, saw a jump of 2.8 million sign-ups in the three days leading up to its exclusive airing of an NFL playoff game.\n\nThe event was \"the single biggest subscriber acquisition moment ever measured\" by Peacock, according to the company.\n\nMovies & TV 'Shogun' leads all Emmy nominees with 25 and 'The Bear' sets comedy series record with 23 By ANDREW DALTON AP Entertainment Writer\n\nEarlier this year, Netflix also announced another high-profile foray into sports programming: A 10-year deal to air \"WWE Raw\" live, valued at more than $5 billion.\n\nBut sports aren't the only way Netflix is trying to expand its footprint.

But shares recovered during the earnings call as investors digested another 8 million-plus subscriber gain and a beat on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nRevenue hit $9.56 billion in Q2, an increase of 16.8% compared to the same period last year, as the streamer continued to lean into top-line initiatives like its crackdown on password sharing and ad-supported tier, in addition to last year's price hikes on certain subscription plans. Analysts were expecting $9.53 billion, according to Bloomberg.\n\nNetflix guided to third quarter revenue of $9.73 billion, a miss compared to consensus estimates of $9.83 billion. The company did increase its full-year 2024 revenue growth projection to 14% to 15%, up from the prior 13% to 15%. It also expects full-year operating margins to hit 26%, an increase from the previous 25%.\n\n\"Our updated revenue forecast reflects solid membership growth trends and business momentum, partially offset by the strengthening of the US dollar vs. most other currencies,\" management said in the earnings release.\n\nDiluted earnings per share (EPS) beat estimates in the quarter with the company reporting EPS of $4.88, above consensus expectations of $4.74 and well ahead of the $3.29 EPS figure it reported in the year-ago period. Netflix guided to third quarter EPS of $5.10, ahead of consensus calls for $4.74.\n\nSubscribers once again came in strong with another 8 million-plus users added on the heels of key programming, such as the latest season of \"Bridgerton.\"\n\nSubscriber additions of 8.05 million beat expectations of 4.7 million and follows the 9.3 million net additions the streamer added in the first quarter. The company had added 5.9 million paying users in Q2 2023.\n\nLeading up to Thursday's release, Netflix's stock had been on a tear. Shares are currently up more than 30% since the start of the year.\n\nIn May, Netflix announced it won the streaming rights to two NFL games set to air on Christmas Day as part of a three-season deal. The company also told advertisers at its May Upfront presentation that its ad tier has reached 40 million global monthly active users -- a significant jump from the 15 million usersthe company revealed back in November and a 35 million-user increase compared to the year-ago period.\n\nIn the earnings release Thursday, the company said it's making \"steady progress scaling [its] ad business\" with ad tier memberships growing 34% quarter on quarter.\n\nIn another bid to boost the ad tier, the company said it will phase out its basic plan membership in the US and France after removing that sign-up option in the UK and Canada last year. The basic tier had previously been its cheapest ad free plan at a price point of $9.99 in the US.\n\n\"Given this sustained progress, we believe that we're on track to achieve critical ad subscriber scale for advertisers in our ad countries in 2025, creating a strong base from which we can further increase our ad membership in 2026 and beyond,\" the company said.\n\nThe growth comes as the streamer has raised the prices of its ad-free subscriptions in an attempt to lure more users to its ad-supported offering. Netflix's password-sharing crackdown has also lifted top-line growth and increased the platform's overall subscriber base.\n\nBut it hasn't been an entirely smooth trajectory upward. In April, Netflix said it would stop reporting subscriber figures, along with a key profitability metric, average revenue per member, or ARM, beginning next year.\n\nThat's raised concerns about the company's long-term subscriber growth and whether or not recent growth momentum can be sustained over the long term.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Discovery made noise earlier this spring when they announced plans to bundle their streaming services Disney+, Hulu and Max, a move that WBD boss David Zaslav called a \"moment\" for programmers in the streaming wars.\n\nHowever, don't expect Netflix to join in.\n\nThe streamer poured cold water on the idea that it would team up with any of its streaming rivals on bundling in its latest financials.\n\n\"We haven't bundled Netflix solely with other streamers like Disney+ or Max because Netflix already operates as a go-to destination for entertainment thanks to the breadth and variety of our slate and superior product experience. This has driven industry leading penetration, engagement and retention for us, which limits the benefit to Netflix of bundling directly with other streamers,\" it noted in a letter to investors.\n\nIt's not hugely surprising given that much of the commentary around the Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery deal was about competing with Netflix, trying to catch up to the company, which revealed today that it has added another 8M subscribers, taking its total to 277M globally.\n\nBack in May, WBD streaming chief JB Perrette said as much, calling the three service bundle \"robust\". \"We don't feel like we need anybody else in that package to make it incredibly compelling,\" he said on WBD's first quarter earnings callm adding that Netflix and Prime Video were seen as \"utilities\".\n\nHowever, Netflix was clear that it still intends to bundle with device makers and \"operator partners\".\n\n\"From the early days of streaming, we saw partnerships with device makers and pay TV and mobile operators as key to ensuring Netflix was easy to find and use. These partnerships are a win-win -- making it simple for people to discover, sign-up, use and pay for Netflix. In turn, our device and operator partners benefit through increased device sales from consumers seeking devices integrated with Netflix and greater customer acquisition and higher retention as well as the opportunity to upsell higher value data or content packages,\" it added.\n\nThis will soothe execs at Comcast and Verizon, which in recent weeks have announced new bundles featuring Netflix.\n\nEarlier this month, Verizon unveiled a plan that sees customers who buy a year of Peacock's premium plan, handed a premium Netflix plan for free for a year. Comcast is also launching StreamSaver that will bundle its own Peacock service with Netflix and Apple TV+, giving customers access to all three for a discount.\n\n\"In some partnerships, operators may include other streaming services in a bundle with Netflix and the operator's services,\" Netflix wrote in the small print.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_white@deadline.com", "name": "Peter White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The streamer announced in its Q1 earnings call back in April that starting next year it will stop reporting subscription numbers each quarter, save for milestones. That has prompted speculation that Netflix may foresee a slowing down in subscription growth.\n\nThe company reported on Thursday that operating margin reached 27%, operating income climbed 42% to reach $2.6bn, and free cash flow was $1.2bn.\n\nQ3, full 2024 forecasts\n\nFor Q3 2024 Netflix has forecast revenue growth of 14% year-on-year and expects paid net additions to be lower than Q3 2023, which was the first full quarter to experience the impact of the company's password sharing crackdown.\n\nFor the full year 2024, based on exchange rates at the end of Q2, Netflix expects revenue growth of 14% to 15%, up from 13% to 15% previously, reflecting \"solid membership growth trends and business momentum\", partially offset by the strengthening of the US dollar against most currencies.\n\nExecutives also expect a 2024 operating margin of 26% based on exchange rates as of January 1 2024, up from the prior estimate of 25% due to \"improved revenue outlook and ongoing expense discipline\". The goal is to grow operating margin each year.\n\nAds tier membership grew 34% quarter-on-quarter. Netflix said in its May upfronts that ad tier users had climbed to 40m, up from 15m reported in a blog post in November 2023.\n\nNetflix is looking to grow average revenue per user (ARPU) on the ad tier above that of the ad-free tier. Last year the company raised its ad-free Basic and Premium tier subscription prices to $11.99 and $22.99 and did not change the $6.99 cost of the ad tier or Standard, which remained at $15.49.\n\nThe company said it is building an in-house ad tech platform that it will test in Canada this year and launch more broadly in 2025.\n\nOn the subject of partnerships, the company said in its letter to shareholders it does not see the value of bundling with other streamers \"because Netflix already operates as a go-to destination for entertainment thanks to the breadth and variety of our slate and superior product experience\".\n\nIndia was Netflix's number two and three country in Q2 in terms of paid net adds driven by the streamer's biggest drama series ever Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar on 15m views.\n\nCo-CEO Ted Sarandos touted Netflix's 107 Emmy nominations this week led by titles like The Crown, Baby Reindeer, Ripley, and 3 Body Problem.\n\n\"We have to spend the next billion dollars better than anyone else in the world,\" Sarandos told analysts in the post-earnings call, \"and there's no-one better at doing that than Netflix.\"\n\nNew interface\n\nThe company revealed it is building a new homepage that will offer users more information \"at a glance\" such as synopses and ratings. The navigation bar is being relocated to the top of the page, and the company is introducing 'My Netflix', a feature previously only available on mobile that shows every film and series a user has saved or watched. The company said the redesign is its biggest update in a decade.\n\nThe share price started the day at $655.7 and fell to $643.04 after the market closed due to revenue forecasts. Stock has increased 37.5% year to date. The all-time high was $691.69 on November 17, 2021.\n\nNetflix is increasing its foothold in live sports and has two Christmas Day NFL American Football games starting in December and the delayed Mike Tyson-Jake Paul boxing match in November. The WWE Raw wrestling weekly live programming starts in 2025.\n\nExecutives said The Roast Of Tom Brady drew 22.6m views to rank as the highest live viewership ever on the platform. Upcoming live events include Joe Rogan: Burn The Boats and hotdog-eating contest Chestnut vs Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef.\n\n\"We're in live because our members love it and it drives engagement... The good news is advertisers like it too,\" Sarandos said.\n\nHe also cited this week's The Gauge report from Nielsen which showed Netflix's share of total TV viewership in the US in June reached 8.4%, second only to YouTube on 9.9%. He added there was a synergy between the two companies.\n\nAsked about AI, Sarandos said it was early to say how the field would impact entertainment but he saw it as a tool to help storytellers do their work.", "source": {"uri": "broadcastnow.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Broadcast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Operating margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest_and_taxes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest and taxes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Product bundling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upfront_(advertising)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Upfront (advertising)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Sarandos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Sarandos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Crown (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://d11p0alxbet5ud.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1120xAny/7/8/8/1428788_bridgerton_914252.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-11-", "textStart": 3742, "textEnd": 3753}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Netflix blew past Wall Street analysts' projections of 4.7 million more subscribers this quarter with a resounding 8 million subscriber increase - pushing the streamer's total number of global subscribers to 277 million. Looking ahead to the year's remaining financial quarters and beyond, the company made it clear in its letter to investors that it won't be getting into the bundling business anytime soon - at least when it comes to other streamers like Disney+ and Max.\n\n\"We haven't bundled Netflix solely with other streamers like Disney+ or Max because Netflix already operates as a go-to destination for entertainment thanks to the breadth and variety of our slate and superior product experience.

On the other hand, the company expects next quarter's revenue to be around $9.73 billion, slightly below analysts' estimates. It made a GAAP profit of $4.88 per share, improving from its profit of $3.29 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Netflix? Find out in our full research report.\n\nLaunched by Reed Hastings as a DVD mail rental company until its famous pivot to streaming in 2007, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) is a pioneering streaming content platform.\n\nConsumers today expect goods and services to be hyper-personalized and on demand. Whether it be what music they listen to, what movie they watch, or even finding a date, online consumer businesses are expected to delight their customers with simple user interfaces that magically fulfill demand. Subscription models have further increased usage and stickiness of many online consumer services.\n\nNetflix's revenue growth over the last three years has been unremarkable, averaging 9.7% annually. This quarter, Netflix reported 16.8% year-on-year revenue growth, in line with analysts' expectations.\n\nGuidance for the next quarter indicates Netflix is expecting revenue to grow 13.9% year on year to $9.73 billion, improving from the 7.8% year-on-year increase it recorded in the comparable quarter last year. Ahead of the earnings results, analysts were projecting sales to grow 13.1% over the next 12 months.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we've identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nAs a subscription-based app, Netflix generates revenue growth by expanding both its subscriber base and the amount each subscriber spends over time.\n\nOver the last two years, Netflix's users, a key performance metric for the company, grew 9.7% annually to 277.7 million. This is decent growth for a consumer internet company.\n\nIn Q2, Netflix added 39.26 million users, translating into 16.5% year-on-year growth.\n\nAverage revenue per user (ARPU) is a critical metric to track for consumer internet businesses like Netflix because it measures how much the average user spends. ARPU is also a key indicator of how valuable its users are (and can be over time).\n\nNetflix's ARPU has declined over the last two years, averaging 1.3%. Although the company's users have continued to grow, it's lost its pricing power and will have to make improvements soon. This quarter, ARPU grew 0.2% year on year to $34.43 per user.\n\nIt was great to see Netflix increase its users this quarter, enabling it to beat Wall Street's revenue, operating margin, and EPS estimates. We were also glad its full-year EPS guidance topped expectations, but its quarterly and full-year revenue outlook fell short. The forecasted top-line metrics were ultimately what the market cared more about, so this was a tough quarter for Netflix. The stock traded down 2.3% to $628.20 immediately following the results.\n\nNetflix may have had a tough quarter, but does that actually create an opportunity to invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

According to CFO Adam Neuman, the ad tier is \"scaling well\" through reach, engagement and a growing inventory.\n\nWe love having an entry price that's lower. That means we are more accessible for more people in our ads market.\n\n\"That represents opportunity for us over a multi-year trajectory to have a big and increasing revenue, and profit impact on the business,\" Neuman added.\n\nNetflix plans to strengthen its offer for advertisers. From September, the streamer will offer Barb measurement of its ad-supported membership plan to help clients better understand audiences and plan campaigns.\n\nNew ad features, such as a pause facility launched as a test in May, have proved popular with big name advertisers such as Ford and McDonald's. Elsewhere, a new in-house ad tech platform - called Upfront - will be tested in Canada this year prior to a wider launch in 2025. According to Netflix, Upfront will offer new ways to buy ads and greater viewer insights, while the streamer also plans to expand its programmatic capabilities.\n\nCo-CEO Greg Peters said the brand would be increasing its \"go-to-market capability\" to drive further advertising revenue growth, starting with a series of new hires.\n\nNetflix subscribers climb after password sharing crackdown\n\n\"So we're adding more sales folks, we're adding more operation folks, building our capabilities to meet advertisers. A big component of that is giving advertisers more ways to buy Netflix,\" he explained.\n\nThe latter point was a major source of advertiser feedback, Peters added, describing ease of buying as a threshold issue that has now been dealt with to unlock new clients. He believes the new tech stack will enable further growth.\n\n\"Think about this as targeting relevance, more capabilities in that space as well as thinking about how do we do ROI, ROAS, incrementality measurements, all the things that we want,\" Peters added.\n\nNetflix's revenues grew 16.8% to $9.56bn (\u00a37.3bn) during the second quarter ending 30 June, while margins improved from 22% to 27%. The brand credits a 16% year-on-year increase in paid memberships for the performance, adding more than 8 million subscribers during the quarter.\n\nThe streaming giant now predicts full year revenue growth of 14%-15%, up slightly from an earlier prediction of 13%-15%. Netflix spent $5.2m (\u00a34m) on marketing during the second quarter alone.\n\nThe door has been left open for future price increases across the board.\n\n\"We think about pricing for ads tier very similarly to how we would think about pricing for our non-ads tier. First of all, I just think it's worth noting that we love having an entry price that's lower. That means we are more accessible for more people in our ads market,\" says Peters.\n\nWhen it comes to raising prices, the co-CEO explained it is Netflix's job to deliver greater value to members through more films, series, games and live events.\n\n\"When we have signals from our members - this is the amount of acquisition that we've got going on, engagement, what our retention and churn looks like - then we find the right moment to ask our members to pay a bit more to keep that flywheel spinning,\" he said.\n\nDescribing viewership as the best proxy for member happiness, Netflix believes it grow its current 6% slice of the $600bn (\u00a3462bn) streaming market by delivering better stories, easier discovery and \"more fandom\", as well as establishing itself in new areas such as live broadcasts, gaming and advertising.\n\nThe streamer also hopes to boost viewership by improving discovery via a \"simpler and more intuitive\" TV homepage launched in June.\n\nLooking specifically at the US, for example, Netflix believes its \"biggest opportunity\" is to win a larger share of the 80% plus of TV time (primarily linear and streaming) that neither Netflix or YouTube claim today.", "source": {"uri": "marketingweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marketing Week"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_valentine@marketingweek.com", "name": "Matthew Valentine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Churn rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fandom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy server"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.marketingweek.com/content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-857x500.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 342, "textEnd": 349}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 2730, "textEnd": 2737}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Analysts expected a total of 4.9 million on average.\n\nThe company's crackdown on password sharing and the introduction of an advertising-supported subscriber plan propelled Netflix to its second-best first half, trailing only the pandemic-fuelled boom in 2020. The less-expensive plan with ads accounted for almost half of new sign-ups last quarter in markets where it's offered, and the company said it will be large enough to appeal to major sponsors next year.\n\nThis quarter, Netflix expects to deliver earnings of US$5.10 a share, higher than Wall Street estimates, on sales of US$9.73 billion, which is slightly less than forecast. The company said subscriber gains will trail last year's 8.76 million, while analysts forecast 5.18 million.\n\nNetflix's surge in growth has occurred while most of its competitors have slowed down, struggling to attract customers and pay for new shows. The service's share of total TV viewing in the US climbed to more than 8 per cent in the most recent month, more than double any other paid streaming service, according to Nielsen data. Netflix delivered a number of major hits last quarter, including a new season of Bridgerton, the surprise hit Baby Reindeer and the French movie Under Paris.\n\n\"The challenge for so many of our competitors is that while they are investing heavily in premium content, it's generating relatively small viewing on their streaming services,\" the company said.\n\nFor the second quarter, Netflix said, earnings rose 48 per cent to US$4.88 a share, beating estimates of US$4.74. Revenue increased 17 per cent to US$9.6 billion, slightly exceeding projections. It ended the quarter with 277.7 million customers worldwide.\n\nShares of Netflix were down more than 2 per cent in extended trading at 4.22 pm in New York. Bullish investors have been pushing the stock back towards the all-time closing high of more than US$690 that they reached in November 2021.\n\nNetflix plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers next year, which many analysts interpreted as a bad sign about their growth going forward.\n\nYet the company, which has added more than 17 million customers this year, struck a confident tone on Thursday, raising its full-year estimate for profit margins.\n\nManagement is increasing the company's investment in video games, with plans to release one new title every month.

This plan, initially met with scepticism, surprised by attracting nearly half of new sign-ups in available markets. Buoyed by this success, Netflix predicts the tier will be attractive to major sponsors by next year.\n\nWhile overall subscriber growth might slow down compared to the record-breaking pandemic year of 2020, Netflix remains optimistic. The company raised its full-year profit margin forecast, signalling confidence in a multi-pronged growth strategy.\n\nOne aspect of this strategy is a shift away from solely focusing on subscriber numbers. Netflix plans to stop reporting this metric next year, indicating a focus on maximizing profitability through various means.\n\nThe ad tier presents a significant opportunity. With over 40 million users already, Netflix expects to convert a \"meaningful number\" into paying subscribers by next year. However, monetization remains a challenge, requiring further development to effectively leverage the growing ad inventory.\n\nAnother avenue for growth is video games. Netflix is ramping up investments, aiming for a monthly release schedule. A much-anticipated Squid Game-inspired title will launch alongside the show's second season, aiming to capitalize on its massive popularity.\n\nNetflix's Q2 report paints a picture of a company firing on all cylinders.

Its net income grew 44% year over year to $2.1 billion.\n\nAnd Netflix's paid memberships reached 277.65 million in the second quarter, up 16% year over year.\n\nThe streaming pioneer's success comes as other media companies struggle to keep up and are still trying to figure out how to make their services profitable. It also shows that Netflix's password crackdown and bet on advertising, which it first debuted on it platform in 2022, were not missteps.\n\nThe company said that its ad-supported memberships grew 34% quarter on quarter and that it accounted for 45% of all new sign up in markets where the plan is available.\n\n\"Our ad revenue is growing nicely and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to our business,\" Netflix said in a press release. However, the company said it doesn't expect advertising to be a \"primary driver of our revenue growth in 2024 or 2025.\"\n\nStill, Netflix is going all in on ads. It touted that it closed over 60 pause ad campaigns -- ads that appear when a program is paused -- with big brands such as Expedia, Coca-Cola, Ford, L'Or\u00e9al and McDonald's. Netflix will also start testing an in-house ad tech platform in Canada this year before launching it more widely in 2025.\n\nNetflix also said it's testing a new TV homepage design that would be more intuitive and increase the visibility of titles, synopses, genres and ratings.

Revenue growth accelerated, and subscriber additions and margins remained at historically high levels. We still believe that recent results represent an especially booming period rather than a durable new norm. However, the firm's current momentum has proven longer lasting than we originally anticipated.\n\nWe are raising our fair value estimate to $500 per share from $440. We believe the stock is pricing in a continuation of recent trends, and while we maintain that Netflix is best-in-class, we still expect the firm to experience slower periods, making the shares overvalued.\n\nSecond-quarter sales rose 17% year over year, the best quarterly result since 2021, but this likely represents a peak for growth. The company has now lapped its broader crackdown on password sharing, which we believe is largely responsible for the spike in subscriber additions that began in the middle of 2023 and has continued.\n\nNetflix increased its subscriber base by another 8 million members during the second quarter, including by 1.5 million in the US, and it has expanded its subscriber base by nearly 17%, or almost 40 million members, over the past year. Netflix has still not yet cracked down on password sharing across its entire membership base, which is one reason we now expect a longer tail of elevated subscriber additions. Still, we think the biggest boost from a perfect storm of catalysts has now passed, especially in the US.\n\nWe expect growth in average revenue per member, which has been flat over the past year, to play a bigger role in sales growth in the long term. ARM increased 7% year over year in the US for the second straight quarter, but ARM declined in all other regions due mostly to a combination of currency weakness and a mix shift to lower-priced markets, like India.\n\nWe expect advertising revenue to be a key contributor to future ARM growth. Netflix is still not yet fully monetizing the opportunity it has with its ad-supported subscriber base and doesn't expect advertising to be a primary driver of revenue growth until 2026. The firm is still building out its capabilities for advertisers, including through its own ad-technology platform, which the firm anticipates broadly launching in 2025. Based on occasional disclosures and growth rates that Netflix discloses, including 34% sequential growth in ad-supported subscribers this quarter, we estimate that about 50 million of the firm's 278 million subscribers are on ad-supported plans, which leaves Netflix ample advertising inventory to monetize when it's better able.\n\nNetflix's operating margin exceeded 27% in the second quarter, up 5 percentage points from the same period last year. Management raised its full-year margin expectation to 26%, which is up 1 percentage point from its previous forecast and would represent 6 percentage points of margin expansion over 2023. We believe Netflix has significant operating leverage on revenue, so we expect the margin to continue expanding over time. Like with revenue growth, however, we don't expect the uptrend to be uninterrupted. We expect costs to rise as the firm builds out the ad-tech platform and other support for advertising sales. We expect lower margins in the second half due, in part, to normalized programming expenses after the Hollywood strikes shut down production in the second half of 2023.\n\nAs expected, the return to normal production has weighed on free cash flow compared with last year, when it was artificially high due to the lack of content production. The firm generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow during the quarter, down about 10% year over year. Netflix reiterated its intention to spend $17 billion on content production for the full year, and it continues to expect free cash flow of about $6 billion, down from $7 billion in 2023.", "source": {"uri": "morningstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Morningstar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_dolgin@morningstar.com", "name": "Matthew Dolgin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social norm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fair value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_leverage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating leverage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sequence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard score"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://morningstar-morningstar-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/CtptDPTtTpgCd72rIIhOUaWzztA=/1200x675/smart/filters:no_upscale()/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/AET2BGC3RFCFRD4YOXDBBVVYS4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Netflix reported a net income of $2.15 billion for the June ended quarter, up from $1.49 billion in the same period last year.\n\nNetflix Co-Chief Executive Officer Theodore A Sarandos highlighted India's vast growth potential, as the country emerged as the second-largest market for the streaming giant in terms of net paid subscriber growth, adding over 8 million new subscribers globally in the second quarter.\n\n\"India's growth is a story that we see around the world playing out very similarly...there's certainly plenty of room to grow in India as long as we keep thrilling our audiences there,\" Sarandos noted during the company Q2 earnings call.\n\nThe world's most populous country claimed the third spot for percent revenue growth, as the US-based firm reported $9.6 billion in revenue, marking its highest year-on-year increase in over four quarters at 16.8%.\n\nThe growth in net paid subscribers and revenue in India was fuelled by hit titles like Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar and Amar Singh Chamkila, along with licensed films such as Laapataa Ladies and Shaitaan, the US-based company said in a letter to investors.\n\nIn Q2, Netflix's global paid memberships rose 16.5% year-over-year to 277.65 million from 238.39 million in the year-ago period. Its global streaming paid net additions increased 36.7% year-on-year.\n\nPaid net additions represent the net change in the number of paid subscribers, calculated as new subscriptions minus cancellations within a specific period. It is an important metric for evaluating the growth of the company's subscriber base.\n\nNetflix reported a net income of $2.15 billion, or $4.88 per share for the June-ended quarter, up from $1.49 billion, or $3.29 per share, in the same period last year.\n\nThe California-headquartered firm said it's making steady progress scaling its ads business as the company's ads tier membership grew 34% quarter-on-quarter. \"We're building an in-house ad tech platform that we'll test in Canada in 2024 and launch more broadly in 2025,\" it added.\n\nAdvertising is becoming an increasingly important business model for media companies in the streaming market. Netflix's ad-supported tier is a clear example of this trend. Its efforts to curb password sharing, designed to increase the number of paying subscribers, further contribute to its revenue growth.\n\nNetflix's ads tier, launched 18 months ago, now accounts for over 45% of all sign-ups in its ads markets.\n\n\"Our ad revenue is growing nicely and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to our business...Based on everything we've learned and our progress over the last 18 months -- we're confident that advertising will be a key component of our longer-term revenue and profit growth,\" it remarked in the letter to investors.\n\nThe streaming company now anticipates full-year revenue growth of 14% to 15%, up from its previous forecast of 13% to 15%.\n\nIt forecasted a 13.9% year-over-year revenue growth for the third quarter of 2024. \"We expect paid net additions to be lower than Q3'23, which had the first full quarter impact from paid sharing,\" the streamer remarked.\n\nNetflix Chief Financial Officer Spencer Adam Neumann pointed out that the company continues to expect approximately 6 billion in free cash flow this financial year.\n\nThe combined market for streaming, pay TV, film, games, and branded advertising exceeds $600 billion, with Netflix currently capturing only about 6% of that revenue.\n\nThe company said looking ahead, it sees its biggest opportunity in capturing a larger portion of over 80% of TV time -- encompassing both traditional broadcast and modern streaming formats -- that is currently not dominated by Netflix or YouTube.", "source": {"uri": "yourstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "yourstory.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ishan_patra@yourstory.com", "name": "Ishan Patra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amar_Singh_Chamkila", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amar Singh Chamkila"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Neumann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Neumann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pay television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/dc9aa1302d6c11e9aa979329348d4c3e/NetflixIndia21576560690342png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Last month, the company said it plans to open two massive entertainment venues called Netflix Houses.\n\nThe \"experiential\" complexes, in former department store locations at Dallas Galleria and King of Prussia mall (near Philadelphia), will each span more than 100,000 square feet and include events, themed gift shops and restaurants. Both will open in 2025.\n\nWhile these complexes don't quite reach the scale or footprint of Disney's or Universal's global theme parks, David Joyce, an analyst at Seaport, said the complexes are designed to drive brand loyalty.\n\n\"It should help retain those customers and keep them in the Netflix ecosystem and paying for their subscriptions for longer,\" he said.\n\nNetflix cancels cheapest plan as subscribers have to choose Narrower choices\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The company raised its revenue growth forecast for 2024 to 14% to 15%, up from 13% to 15%.\n\nThe strong performance is a sign that Netflix's efforts to change its plan pricing and lineup, limit password sharing and grow the advertising tier of its service are bearing fruit.\n\nNetflix on Thursday said it would begin phasing out its lowest-cost ad-free $11.99 a month basic plan in the U.S. and France. The company made similar moves in Canada and the U.K earlier this year.\n\nThe third season of hit show \"Bridgerton\" premiered during the second quarter, as did other original shows such as drama \"Baby Reindeer,\" and the comedic film \"Hit Man\" starring Glen Powell, all of which helped drive viewership. The company has been streaming more live events, including sports, to attract advertisers and said \"The Roast of Tom Brady\" attracted its biggest live audience yet.\n\nNetflix continues to lead the pack in streaming as entertainment companies such as Disney and Warner Bros Discovery try to balance a decline in revenue and viewership of their traditional TV businesses while investing more in their streaming platforms. Smaller companies like Paramount Global, whose controlling shareholder Shari Redstone earlier this month agreed to sell her company to David Ellison's Skydance Media, are learning that they can't afford to go it alone.\n\nNetflix shares are up almost 40% so far this year. It ended the second quarter with 277.65 million customers globally.\n\nNet profit grew 44% to $2.15 billion in the quarter, topping the company's forecast of $2.06 billion.\n\nIt expects operating margins of 26% this year, up from its prior estimate of 25%. The company reported free cash flow of $1.21 billion, down from $1.34 billion a year earlier.\n\nThe streamer has continued to revamp its lineup while also continuing to diversify its content and improve its user experience.\n\nNetflix is redesigning its home page to feature more visible title information, such as a synopsis of the show or movie and ratings, as well as offering more immersive trailers. It plans to add a \"My Netflix\" section, with titles subscribers have saved or watched, a feature that was previously only available on its mobile app.\n\nIt is also ramping up the number of games it offers that are based on its own shows and movies, and plans to launch one new game a month starting in July, with such titles as \"Emily in Paris,\" and \"Selling Sunset.\" The company plans to time its first multiplayer game based on its popular \"Squid Game\" title to the launch of the second season of the series.\n\n\"If we execute well -- better stories, easier discovery and more fandom -- while also establishing ourselves in newer areas like live, games and advertising, we believe that we have a lot more room to grow,\" the company said in a letter to shareholders.\n\nNetflix drew 8.4% of U.S. TV viewing time in June, according to ratings firm Nielsen, its greatest share since its strongest-ever showing of 8.5% last July.\n\nWrite to Jessica Toonkel at jessica.toonkel@wsj.com", "source": {"uri": "wsj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_toonkel@wsj.com", "name": "Jessica Toonkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Many of us (guilty) are paying for a Netflix subscription without using its capabilities to the fullest. Examples include being unaware of options for better video quality and saving mobile data when streaming in-app.\n\nDon't fret -- check out these sweet Netflix tips to learn how to optimize your streaming time. Some of these hacks are unofficial workarounds, whereas others are more general and show you how to use all of Netflix's tools to your advantage.\n\n1. Unblock Geoblocked Content With a VPN\n\nBy using a VPN, you can access geoblocked content from around the world. Due to copyright restrictions, the content in Netflix libraries differs by country. For example, if you've been catching up on Outlander season five in Canada and then travel to the U.S., you'll find season five unavailable on Netflix there.\n\nThe story is the same if you've been watching Stranger Things or Ragnarok on Netflix and then you travel to a country where Netflix is blocked. You'll need one of the best VPNs for Netflix to access your account.\n\nYou can get around this and hack Netflix content limited to other countries by connecting to a VPN server in that country. For example, if you're in the U.S. and want to watch Outlander season five, just connect to a Canadian server before opening Netflix. Find out more on how to do this in our changing Netflix location guide.\n\n2. Unlock the Netflix Secret Menu\n\nThough the Netflix library is already pretty expansive, with a bit of intel, you can unlock hidden categories. There is a collection of Netflix codes you can use to access content in different categories -- check out our Netflix secret codes post for more on this.\n\nFor instance, if you wanted to unlock movies in the action comedy genre, you would type in https://netflix.com/browse/genre/xx and then add the code to the end. It would look like this: https://netflix.com/browse/genre/43040.\n\n3. Stream in HD\n\nStandard and Premium Netflix subscriptions let you watch in HD, while Premium subscribers can also watch in Ultra HD. To make sure you're streaming in the best video quality possible, go to playback settings by clicking \"account,\" selecting a profile and then navigating to \"playback settings.\" Here, you can adjust to \"HD\" or \"Ultra HD\" if your subscription allows for it.\n\n4. Use the Search Bar Wisely\n\nThe search bar lets you do more than simply search for shows and movies. If you're looking for a movie but can't remember the name, try searching for a keyword related to the movie, like the genre or an actor's name.\n\nIf you're not sure what you'd like to watch but have a vague idea, you can type in something like \"Academy Award-Winning\" to see what's available.\n\n5. Boot Spongers Off Your Account\n\nIf you've been kind enough to share your Netflix account with former friends or exes in the past, they could still be reaping the benefits while you foot the bill. Luckily, there is a way to boot them off your account for good.\n\nGo to your account, scroll down to \"sign out of all devices\" and then change your Netflix password.\n\n6. Delete Your Viewing History\n\nIf you don't want others to know your viewing habits, you can selectively delete shows and movies in your Netflix viewing history. Go to your account and click on your profile, then \"viewing activity.\" To delete something, just click on the \"hide\" icon to the right.\n\n7. Binge Watch From a Distance\n\nUsing a Chrome extension is a great way to enjoy streaming Netflix with extra features. Teleparty (formerly Netflix Party Chrome extension), for example, lets you watch TV shows and movies with friends who aren't physically present. Anyone wishing to join a Teleparty needs to have their own Netflix account.\n\nIt even includes a nifty chat feature for group discussions or for the dreaded \"movie talker\" in your group to indulge in while everyone else watches in peace and quiet.\n\n8. Install IMDb Ratings for Netflix\n\nAnother cool Chrome extension is IMDb Ratings for Netflix, which shows you the Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and IMDb ratings for the movie you're considering. This saves you from having to pull up a separate tab or window and search for ratings on individual movies or shows.\n\n9. Take Control of Your Data Usage\n\nWatching Netflix on the phone app can demolish your mobile data. To make sure you aren't using up all your data unnecessarily, go to your phone's cellular settings. Scroll down to your phone's apps, find Netflix and toggle \"WLAN\" on.\n\nThis will make sure the app only streams when connected to WiFi, thereby saving your data. If you don't have WiFi access and need to use your cellular data, toggle \"WLAN & Cellular Data\" on.\n\n10. Use the Offline Playback Feature\n\nIf you'll be flying but don't want to miss something, you can download movies or shows for offline viewing. For this, you'll need to download the Netflix app to your device. If a movie or show is downloadable, you'll see a download icon (a downward-facing arrow) on the title's description page. Some titles aren't available for download.\n\n11. Choose How the Interface Looks\n\nEveryone has different preferences when it comes to how content is arranged on your screen. When you select \"movies\" or \"TV shows,\" if you navigate to the top-right corner, you'll see two options -- an icon with three lines and an icon with four boxes.\n\nIf you click the icon with three lines, Netflix will sort movies and shows into categories. If you go for the four boxes, the content won't be categorized and you can just scroll straight through.\n\n12. Let Netflix Pick a Title for You\n\nIf you're not in the mood to trawl through Netflix looking for something to watch, you can let Netflix make the choice for you. Those with the Netflix TV app can select the \"play something\" option on the left side of the screen.\n\nIf you're an Android user, you'll see the icon at the bottom of your phone's app. The \"play something\" option isn't currently available on iOS.\n\n13. Adjust Your Subtitle Settings\n\nIf you go to the speech bubble in the bottom-right corner, you can choose to show or hide subtitles. This is an especially cool feature for language learners who want to delve into the world of foreign films.\n\n14. Adjust Audio Settings & Dubbing\n\nIn addition to turning subtitles on and off, you can also choose your audio language. If you find subtitles distracting but want to watch something in a language you don't understand, this is a great alternative.\n\n15. Learn a Language While You Stream\n\nIf you're a movie fan, why not learn a new language while you're at it? Language Reactor is a Chrome extension that offers some pretty cool features, including dual subtitles and a dictionary. At Cloudwards, we're big on language learning, so we think this extension is pretty sweet.\n\n16. Make Use of Streaming Guides\n\nStreaming guides like Instant Watcher and Reel Good are useful for finding out what's out there in the big Netflix pond. With so many titles and content being added and removed on a regular basis, streaming guides can show you what's new, what countries shows and movies are available in and languages you can watch them in.\n\n17. Know Your Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nGetting to know the Netflix keyboard shortcuts can save you time you'd otherwise spend hunting down icons with your mouse. A few examples:\n\nIf you're sharing your account with family or friends, there's no need to endure recommendations for content you're not so keen on yourself. Netflix allows you to set up separate profiles for up to five users.\n\nThis is especially useful if you have children, as you can adjust maturity settings on their individual profiles. However, this could soon change with the Netflix password sharing crackdown. Read our Netflix password sharing: Canada guide to learn more.\n\nTo set up multiple profiles, hover over your account icon in the top-right corner and a dropdown menu will appear. Go to \"manage profiles\" and click on \"add profile.\"\n\n19. Create a PIN for Your Profile\n\nIf you don't want other users on your account to access your profile and see the content you watch, there is a fix. Go to \"account,\" then select the profile you want to lock. Go down to \"profile lock\" and follow the instructions to create a PIN.\n\n20. Control Playback Speed\n\nIf you navigate to the little speedometer icon in the bottom right-corner of the video, you can adjust your playback speed. This is another great tactic for language learners who can't quite keep up with native language speeds.\n\n21. Use \"Thumbs Up\" & \"Thumbs Down\" Buttons\n\nFor the best possible Netflix recommendations, make use of the \"thumbs up\" and \"thumbs down\" buttons by hovering over a movie or show's thumbnail. If you indicate to Netflix that you like a certain kind of content, the algorithm becomes more attuned to your tastes and can recommend additional content that you'll actually enjoy.\n\n22. Tidy Up Your \"Continue Watching\" Row\n\nWhen you stop watching a show or movie halfway, it will remain in your \"continue watching\" row. This can be somewhat annoying if you actually stopped watching because you didn't like the content. You can get rid of it though -- simply hover over the thumbnail and click the \"X\" to remove it.\n\n23. Go With a Decent Streaming ISP\n\nSome internet providers perform better with Netflix than others in terms of speed. Check out Netflix's ISP speed index to see how your internet service provider measures up and find out whether it may be worth switching providers.\n\n24. Look Into Getting Netflix Cheaper or for Free\n\nNetflix used to offer a free trial, but unfortunately, it no longer does. There are a few tips and tricks you can use to get Netflix for free or at a reduced price, though.\n\nThat said, there's no guarantee -- whether or not you can make it happen depends on factors like your ISP and your location. Check out our how to watch Netflix for free guide for more on this.\n\n25. Watch Netflix on the Big Screen\n\nStreaming devices like Chromecast, Firestick and Roku let you stream Netflix and a number of other streaming services on your TV instead of on your phone or computer. You can read our guide on how to watch Netflix on TV to learn more. Now, we all know that smart TVs can be pricey.\n\nFortunately, many streaming devices are reasonably priced, giving you the home cinema experience with Netflix without breaking the bank.", "source": {"uri": "cloudwards.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cloudwards"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kit_copson@cloudwards.net", "name": "Kit Copson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlander_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Outlander (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virtual private network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google Chrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High-definition television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Subtitles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-definition_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ultra-high-definition television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IMDb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Library (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wireless LAN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playback_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playback (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metacritic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumbnail", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thumbnail"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment/Online_Media", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment/Online Media", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Databases", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.cloudwards.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/best-netflicks-hacks-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Categories include streaming, cable, broadcast and other. Though YouTube led the streaming category with 9.9% share, Netflix contributed to more than half of the streaming category's 1.5 share point increase since May. While Netflix seems to have won the \"streaming wars\", the company continues to face competition from streaming services like Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu and Apple TV+.\n\nNetflix's second quarter saw a star-studded production lineup with Netflix Originals \"A Family Affair\" featuring Nicole Kidman and Zac Efron, \"The Roast of Tom Brady\" and the third season of Bridgerton capturing wide audiences. Netflix was the most nominated brand for the 76th annual Primetime Emmy Awards, gaining 107 nominations across 35 series. The company also entered new territory with live sports in May, winning streaming rights for two NFL games for the 2024 season. The streaming platform's strategy allowed it to capture 600 million viewers within the second quarter, while anticipation rises as the platform expands to include new categories of entertainment. While driving production forward, Netflix has navigated dwindling subscription growth with password sharing crackdowns and grown its ad-supported offering priced at $6.99. In May, the company announced its ad-supported tier -- which launched in October 2022 -- had doubled monthly users this year to 40 million. Netflix additionally pushed revenue growth by hiking subscription prices up 20% for Basic plan users -- from $9.99 to $11.99 a month -- and 15% for Premium plan users -- from $19.99 to $22.99 a month -- last October. Increases in pricing in 2024 are expected to keep in line with the company's revenue growth strategy.\n\nNetflix's shares, priced at $643, have increased 37% year to date, outperforming \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks including Google, Microsoft and Apple, though the stock has yet to top its peak price from 2021. Additionally, the streaming platform has far outperformed its direct competitors such as Warner Bros., Paramount Global and Comcast, whose stocks have fallen 27%, 19% and 8% year to date, respectively. Netflix's shares were at an all-time high in November 2021 but plummeted 76% over the following eight months. Since its unprecedented lows in June 2022, the stock has gradually recovered, with shares surging back to its previous highs.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primetime Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Kidman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicole Kidman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Efron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zac Efron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Marketing_Support_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Marketing Support Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66993149b4f487253d718445/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=5404,3041,x0,y90,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

She has a background in economics with a PhD from Stanford (and she once worked as a trader at Merrill Lynch), which is very unusual for a top-level tech exec.\n\n\"I feel like I use my economics background on almost a daily basis,\" says Stone. As she notes, \"We don't have endless resources. So we want to spend our time and energy and dollars on things that are going to be most impactful for Netflix.\"\n\nNetflix has long used machine learning and artificial intelligence, which have powered the core of its personalized recommendations. In the last few years, generative AI -- which creates text, images, videos or other data, based on a vast databases of source material -- has exploded into the mainstream. Stone says the gen AI wave is \"a step function in that technology\" and that Netflix is exploring how to integrate it into the product to improve the member experience or how it could \"enable creators and bring their visions to life in an even better way.\"\n\nOne new AI project she says Netflix is working on now is an \"interactive discovery experience.\" Is it an AI chatbot, \u00e0 la OpenAI's ChatGPT? Not exactly. Without describing it in detail, Stone says it's \"a way to think about organizing the catalog, which is so big, into something that feels more tractable for members to help them discover things, and reshaping the moment or understanding of what a member is looking for. So we're working on prototypes of that.\"\n\nWhen will it see the light of day? Possibly soon: \"We're still working on that internally to make sure that it's a really good experience for members before we have members trying it themselves,\" Stone says.\n\nNetflix's technology prowess has admirers across the industry -- including Disney chief Bob Iger, who earlier this year acknowledged that the Mouse House needs \"to be at their level in terms of technology capability.\"\n\n\"I think Netflix's superpower for a long time has been the way that technology can be so valuable for entertainment, and can bring an innovation to entertainment that's really appealing to consumers,\" Stone says. \"I agree with Bob Iger that Netflix has, I think, a strength that is very important that we maintain.\"\n\nStone says part of the culture at Netflix, especially in the technology team, is to think about what's best for the business. \"And that's a motivator for the team, versus feeling like, you know, we've got people nipping at our heels, and we feel the pressure to stay ahead. But you know, we're also a business and we're hoping to be successful, which means you do have to have some real drive to do an even better job than what the competition's doing. So I hope we keep that drive.\"\n\nOne of the top priorities for Stone and the Netflix tech team is improving its capabilities to deliver live content -- particularly with its biggest move yet into live sports later this year: two NFL games on Christmas Day 2024.\n\nNetflix has learned a lot since the \"Love Is Blind\" live reunion special in April 2023 failed to launch. It's a \"distant memory, thankfully, because it's a painful one for many of us on the team,\" Stone says. \"I think the thing about 'Love Is Blind' is that it was a good reminder of how complicated it really is to deliver live well at scale. And it can seem like it should be an easy thing, because broadcasters around the world do this every day.\" But, she says, \"being able to adapt the way Netflix has optimized streaming video-on-demand for streaming live content is complex... We've gained a ton of amazing learnings around just how to ensure greater reliability and stability for members who are watching and even operational aspects of things.\" Netflix has applied those learnings to more recent live events, like the Tom Brady roast this past May, \"so that gives us some preparation for NFL but it's still a big challenge ahead of us that the team has to be really focused on.\"\n\nOn the podcast, Stone also talks about Netflix's famous corporate culture, the \"no rules\" philosophy that co-founder Reed Hastings established in its early days. As spelled out in Netflix's culture memo, which the company updated last month, the framework includes the \"keeper test,\" which encourages managers to part ways with employees if the answer is \"no\" to the question, \"If X wanted to leave, would I fight to keep them?\"\n\n\"It's not difficult to adapt to when everyone's doing it,\" Stone says. \"So what I find about Netflix is, if you find that your peers are being candid with you -- what you're doing well, where you could be doing better -- you feel like you're invested in each other's success.\" When Stone was interviewing at Netflix, she says, that radical honesty \"sounded like a fascinating and great fit for me with what I was looking for.\"\n\nBut Netflix has had to evolve its \"no rules rules\" to, well, add some kinds of process framework. Today, Netflix is a bigger company than even when Stone joined in April 2020. \"We've had to change some of the operating practices just so we stay effective as a company,\" she says. \"So one of the things that's evolved since I've been here is more leadership conversation and communication around, 'Here's what's top-of-mind for us this year.' And that provides some structure for how many, many teams think about, 'Well, then this is what we should do to nest into these company priorities.'\" That's not a rule or mandate per se, Stone says, but \"it's guidance that I think allows people to feel more aligned across thousands of people.\"\n\n\"Strictly Business\" is Variety's weekly podcast featuring conversations with industry leaders about the business of media and entertainment.

Here's what it could mean.", "body": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nAds is the second area under Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters, along with games, to have a recent leadership shake-up.\n\nSome observers read into the news that it was a sign that Netflix was seeing its ads business as more of a programmatic play than one built on relationships forged at industry events and over lunches.\n\nThere's some reason for that. In its shareholder letter put out Thursday ahead of its Q2 earnings call, Netflix stressed its plan to launch an in-house ad tech platform to give advertisers new ways to buy ads and measure their impact. It's also planning to start using adtech companies The Trade Desk, Google DV 360, and Magnite to give advertisers more ways to buy ads on Netflix. It plans to hire more ad operations experts as well.\n\nNetflix said on its earnings call that its ad revenue was becoming a more meaningful contributor to the business but that it didn't expect advertising to be a primary revenue driver until at least 2026 because it was growing faster than its ability to monetize the service through ads. Netflix posted its fourth quarter in a row of double-digit subscription gains, with subs up 16.5% to 278 million.\n\nThe idea that Netflix is making a greater programmatic push and, therefore, has less of a need for an exec like Naylor, who is well-connected and well-respected in ad circles, is a head-scratcher to some, though. While Netflix's ads business is still small, advertisers see it as having the potential to be a premium ad buy because of its push into live events, including sports. And it regularly produces shows that get people talking.\n\nAlso, Netflix is trying to package ads with other things related to its shows, like experiences and co-promotions, which is a high-touch, relationships business.\n\nSome observers saw the timing of the leadership shake-up as unfavorable to Netflix, as Amazon is gaining an edge on Netflix with its own advertising sales effort that rolled out in the past year.\n\nAmazon has a bigger ad-supported audience, a larger sports footprint, and lower ad prices than Netflix going for it. It also has a broad portfolio, including Twitch and Wondery, that advertisers can use to extend their ad buys, and the ability to tie ads to sales results.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucia_moses@businessinsider.com", "name": "Lucia Moses", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trade_Desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Trade Desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6699a48880d4d5da13d53b70?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

The removal of this plan comes as Netflix has touted the success of its less than two-year-old ad-supported offering, which comes at a cost of $6.99 per month.\n\nFor ad-free experiences, Netflix offers plans that start at $15.49 per month.\n\n\"We've got a very strong offering for our members,\" Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said of the ad tier during the company's second quarter earnings call on Thursday. \"We think that represents a tremendous entertainment value and it includes ads. For members who don't want that ads experience, they can choose our ads free standard or premium plans.\"\n\nOverall, Peters said eliminating the basic plan overseas has been a success so far: \"We've had the confidence to move forward with that change in the US and France, so that's an indicator of how it's going.\"\n\nIn the earnings release Thursday, Netflix said it's making \"steady progress scaling [its] ad business\" with ad tier memberships growing 34% quarter on quarter, boosted in part by the removal of the basic plan in certain markets.\n\n\"Given this sustained progress, we believe that we're on track to achieve critical ad subscriber scale for advertisers in our ad countries in 2025, creating a strong base from which we can further increase our ad membership in 2026 and beyond,\" the company said.\n\nIn May, Netflix revealed during its Upfront presentation that its ad tier has reached 40 million global monthly active users -- a significant jump from the 15 million users the company revealed back in November and a 35 million-user increase compared to the year-ago period.\n\nThe growth comes as the streamer has raised the prices of its ad-free subscriptions in an attempt to lure more users to its ad-supported offering.\n\nWhen asked on the earnings call Thursday whether or not the company would consider raising its $6.99 price point of the ad tier to boost its average revenue per member, Peters said they \"think about pricing for the ads tier very similarly to how we would think about pricing for our non-ads tier.\"\n\n\"It's our job to increase the value that we are delivering all of our members,\" Peters said, citing the company's recent live event push, along with new original programming and games. \"When we have signals from our members [like acquisition, engagement, retention and churn] then we find the right moment to ask our members to pay a bit more to keep that flywheel spinning.\"\n\nNetflix reported second quarter earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines while subscriber additions surged past 8 million. Still, it wasn't all good news. Shares initially traded lower after the streaming giant's revenue outlook missed Wall Street's expectations for the current quarter.\n\nThe stock has since recovered, hovering just above the flatline in after-hours trading.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Here's what Wall Street is watching", "body": "Netflix reports after the bell Thursday, ushering in the start of earnings season for Wall Street's biggest media and technology giants. Analysts expect the streaming behemoth to post earnings of $4.74 per share on about $9.53 billion in revenue, according to analysts polled by LSEG. Last quarter , the company earned $5.28 per share on $9.37 billion in revenue, and saw a 16% increase in total memberships. Many analysts expect another strong print from Netflix as the company clamps down on password sharing, ramps up its advertising tier and rolls out a strong content slate. Several major firms even lifted their price targets ahead of the report. \"Looking forward, the mixture of subscriber tailwinds, the potential for more widely global pricing moves and a robust content slate (especially [returning] titles into 2025) leaves NFLX positively positioned for operating momentum in the coming quarters,\" wrote Goldman Sachs' Eric Sheridan, who has a neutral rating. The analyst regards upside to subscriber additions, commentary surrounding margin expansion and a reacceleration in revenue as key for investors. Morgan Stanley's Benjamin Swinburne increased his price target to $780 from $700 ahead of the results, saying that advertising should support strong top-line numbers and margin expansion. He views the company as being in a \"league of its own,\" with a path ahead for a $950 \"bull case\" price target next year. The adjustment reflects 20% potential upside from Wednesday's close. \"For NFLX shares, much is priced in but we remain bullish given the still large opportunity for growth ahead,\" he wrote. \"We are admittedly paying in NFLX multiple for the track record this management team has built over two decades navigating disruption and exploiting opportunities advertising will increase in import to deliver on top-line and margin expansion expectations.\" Even more critical for investors and Wall Street may be the company's subscriber numbers as it races to attract eyeballs in a competitive streaming environment. The company previously said that it expects new subscriber numbers to come in below last quarter's 9.3 million due to seasonality and will stop disclosing quarterly additions in 2025. Jefferies analyst James Heaney expects these programs and a strong content slate position Netflix well for a second-quarter subscriber beat. He lifted his estimate for the quarter to 5.8 million net additions from 4.9 million. Elsewhere, JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth boosted his forecast to 6 million net additions in the quarter, from 5 million, and anticipates 30 million net additions for the calendar year. The analyst holds an overweight rating and raised his price target to $750 from $650 earlier this month. On the paid-sharing front, Morgan Stanley's Swinburne estimated that Netflix will convert 30% to 40% of the 100 million households that shared passwords in 2022 to subscribers by year-end. \"This suggests there is still runway to bring on new members that in theory should be easier to bring onto the service than those households that have never used Netflix before,\" he said. \"Our 2025 forecast for 20-21mm paid net adds reflects a view that paid sharing benefits fade more materially next year.\" Netflix has made strides within advertising, disclosing in May that there were 40 million active monthly users in the tier. But some analysts view the story as early-stage, with Evercore ISI's Mark Mahaney noting that ad demand needs to \"fully catch up to subscriptions.\" NFLX YTD mountain Netflix shares since the start of the year Bank of America doesn't \"expect a material revenue contribution until 2025 -- especially given the glut of new inventory coming to market (given the launch of several competitor ad-supported services in recent months) alongside the backdrop of a mixed advertising environment,\" wrote analyst Jessica Ehrlich. To be sure, some analysts are warning investors to tread carefully heading into earnings. That includes Citi's Jason Bazinet and Piper Sandler's Matt Farrell. Both firms retained their neutral ratings as the stock has risen 34% year to date. \"We continue our neutral stance on the stock, as we think the risk/reward profile is balanced heading into print,\" Farrell wrote. \"However, we believe Netflix has proven itself to be the leader in streaming.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samantha_subin@cnbc.com", "name": "Samantha Subin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evercore", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evercore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obesity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107319574-1697660177746-gettyimages-1052818026-775247161TC006_Netflix_Illu.jpeg?v=1721312699&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Mario Tama | Getty ImagesNetflix reported second-quarter earnings Thursday that showcased the media giant's position at the head of the streaming race as it added more global subscribers and saw strong growth in its advertising business.The streamer said its ad-supported memberships grew 34% during the period compared to the same quarter last year.Advertising has become an increasingly important business model for media companies to boost -- or in some cases, achieve -- profitability for streaming. Netflix's stock has been boosted in recent quarters by its push to gain subscribers on its cheaper, ad-supported tier, in addition to its crackdown on password sharing.Here's how the company performed for the period ended June 30, compared with Wall Street expectations:Earnings per share: $4.88 vs $4.74 per share expected by LSEGRevenue: $9.56 billion vs.9.53 billion expected by LSEGTotal memberships: 277.65 million global paid memberships vs. 274.4 million expected, according to StreetAccountRevenue was roughly $9.6 billion, up 17% compared to the year-earlier period, driven primarily by the increase in average paid memberships.Netflix said it now expects full-year reported revenue growth of 14% to 15%, compared with previous guidance of 13% to 15%.The company reported net income of $2.15 billion, or $4.88 per share, up from $1.49 billion, or $3.29 per share, during the second quarter of 2023.Netflix's global paid memberships rose 16.5% year over year to 278 million. This marks one of the last updates Netflix will release regarding its membership numbers.Last quarter, the company warned investors it would stop providing quarterly membership numbers or average revenue per user beginning in 2025, noting the company is \"focused on revenue and operating margin as our primary financial metrics -- and engagement (i.e. time spent) as our best proxy for customer satisfaction.\"[embedded content]Netflix's stock has been uplifted by its crackdown on password sharing and the addition of a cheaper, ad-supported tier.Netflix began focusing on different business strategies to drive revenue growth after the streamer saw subscriber growth slow in 2022. In May, Netflix said it would launch its own ad platform and no longer partner with Microsoft for that technology. The company also has begun adding live sports, such as NFL games on Christmas Day over the next three years, a move that will likely attract more ad dollars for the streamer.\"We're in live [TV] because our members love it, and it drives a ton of engagement and a ton of excitement ... and the good thing is advertisers like it for the exact same reason,\" said Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos on Thursday's earnings call.Netflix had been dipping its toe into live content even before its deal with the NFL, with Sarandos noting the company's focus on \"buzzy, exclusive live entertainment.\"Still, original shows like \"Bridgerton\" and \"Baby Reindeer\" continue to drive engagement for the streamer.Luke Newton and Nicola Coughlan attend the special screening of \"Bridgerton\" Season 3 - Part Two at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square on Ju ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odeon_Luxe_Leicester_Square", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Odeon Luxe Leicester Square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Sarandos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Sarandos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Coughlan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Coughlan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_satisfaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer satisfaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Newton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 897, "textEnd": 904}], "sentiment": 0.8666666666666667, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

The company has now lapped its broader crackdown on password sharing, which we believe is largely responsible for the spike in subscriber additions that began in the middle of 2023 and has continued. Netflix increased its subscriber base by another 8 million members during the second quarter, including by 1.5 million in the US, and it has expanded its subscriber base by nearly 17%, or almost 40 million members, over the past year. Netflix has still not yet cracked down on password sharing across its entire membership base, which is one reason we now expect a longer tail of elevated subscriber additions. Still, we think the biggest boost from a perfect storm of catalysts has now passed, especially in the US.\n\nWe expect growth in average revenue per member, which has been flat over the past year, to play a bigger role in sales growth in the long term. ARM increased 7% year over year in the US for the second straight quarter, but ARM declined in all other regions due mostly to a combination of currency weakness and a mix shift to lower-priced markets, like India.\n\nWe expect advertising revenue to be a key contributor to future ARM growth. Netflix is still not yet fully monetising the opportunity it has with its ad-supported subscriber base and doesn't expect advertising to be a primary driver of revenue growth until 2026. The firm is still building out its capabilities for advertisers, including through its own ad-technology platform, which the firm anticipates broadly launching in 2025. Based on occasional disclosures and growth rates that Netflix discloses, including 34% sequential growth in ad-supported subscribers this quarter, we estimate that about 50 million of the firm's 278 million subscribers are on ad-supported plans, which leaves Netflix ample advertising inventory to monetize when it's better able.\n\nNetflix's operating margin exceeded 27% in the second quarter, up 5 percentage points from the same period last year. Management raised its full-year margin expectation to 26%, which is up 1 percentage point from its previous forecast and would represent 6 percentage points of margin expansion over 2023. We believe Netflix has significant operating leverage on revenue, so we expect the margin to continue expanding over time. Like with revenue growth, however, we don't expect the uptrend to be uninterrupted. We expect costs to rise as the firm builds out the ad-tech platform and other support for advertising sales. We expect lower margins in the second half due, in part, to normalised programming expenses after the Hollywood strikes shut down production in the second half of 2023.\n\nAs expected, the return to normal production has weighed on free cash flow compared with last year, when it was artificially high due to the lack of content production. The firm generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow during the quarter, down about 10% year over year. Netflix reiterated its intention to spend $17 billion on content production for the full year, and it continues to expect free cash flow of about $6 billion, down from $7 billion in 2023.", "source": {"uri": "morningstar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Morningstar UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_leverage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating leverage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard score"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.morningstar.co.uk/static/UploadManager/Assets/Netflix%20logo%202024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The streaming giant announced the move in its second quarter earnings report on Thursday as part of ongoing efforts to boost revenue and nudge users towards its advertising-supported plan.\n\nThe $11.99 per month Basic plan, which was already unavailable to new subscribers, will be phased out for legacy customers in the U.S.and France. Subscribers will need to choose between the $6.99 ad-supported tier or upgrade to pricier Standard ($15.49) or Premium ($22.99) plans to maintain ad-free viewing.\n\nThis strategy follows a similar rollout in the UK and Canada earlier this month. Netflix reported that over 45% of new sign-ups are opting for the ad-supported tier in markets where it's available, signalling growing acceptance of commercials among subscribers.\n\n\"Our ad revenue is growing nicely and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to our business,\" Netflix stated in its earnings report. The company is also testing pause ads that appear when viewers stop playback.\n\nDespite the pricing changes, Netflix added 8 million global subscribers in the second quarter, beating analyst expectations of 5 million. Popular titles like \"Bridgerton\" and \"Baby Reindeer\" helped drive growth.\n\nLooking ahead, Netflix plans to shift its growth metrics in 2024, focusing on revenue by region rather than total subscriber numbers. The company cited this change as reflecting \"the evolution of the business\" as it prioritises advertising and subscriber retention.\n\nWhile the strategy aims to increase revenue, it may face pushback from budget-conscious subscribers who previously enjoyed ad-free viewing at a lower price point.\n\nThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Many analysts anticipate the streaming giant will build on several quarters of revenue and subscriber growth as it moves into live sports, all while touting margins that remain the envy of the industry.\n\nNetflix is currently receiving price targets of $750 or higher from the likes of J.P. Morgan, Jefferies and Morgan Stanley. The company has routinely exceeded expectations, said Third Bridge's Jamie Lumley, who noted its operating margin rose by 28% last quarter.\n\n\"It's the best in class,\" Lumley said. \"It's really just knocking out of the park a lot of these metrics.\"\n\nThe stock was trading around the $640 mark midday Thursday, down almost 6% for the week, but shares are up over 40% in the past year.\n\nFor Netflix, the summer months tend to be relatively soft. During its last earnings call in April, Netflix forecast a decline in new subscribers and a fall in diluted earnings per share from $5.28 to $4.68. Still, the company predicted revenue growth of 16% for the quarter, which equated to 21% growth when adjusted for foreign exchange factors. Those projections may be conservative, analysts at J.P. Morgan said in a note last week.\n\nBarring results that are exceedingly positive (or negative), however, Lumley said a huge movement in the stock is unlikely. Netflix may be a victim of its own success, he said, after several excellent quarters.\n\n\"It is hard to continue to deliver on that,\" he said.\n\nSome key growth drivers might also be losing steam, including the company's highly successful crackdown on password sharing. Out of an estimated 100 million households who were sharing logins to watch shows like Bridgerton and Stranger Things before \"paid sharing\" was introduced last year, Netflix expected to covert about half of those users into new subscribers, Lumley said. As of last quarter, Netflix had added 37 million new subscriptions in the past year, raising questions about how long the move will buoy the company's top line.\n\nAnalysts are watching if the service's cheaper ad-supported tier, which had amassed 40 million users as of May, can fill the potential void. A recent note from Bloomberg Intelligence estimated Netflix's total advertising revenue could reach $2 billion by the end of 2024 and double in 2025.\n\nThen there's the company's move into live sports, punctuated by a deal with the NFL to air two live games on Christmas Day and a 10-year, $5 billion agreement with World Wrestling Entertainment, or WWE, the pro wrestling behemoth cofounded by Vince McMahon.\n\nLumley said the big spending is an attempt to find properties that can keep viewers engaged after they've finished binging their favorite show. An ability to invest in an industry-leading content library is helpful, too.\n\n\"[Netflix is] trying to appeal to the widest audience possible,\" Lumley said. \"Not all the other players can do that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix is changing the way it communicates data about customer satisfaction to investors. In its last earnings call, the company announced it would stop reporting subscriber numbers starting in 2025. Now that the company generates substantial profit and free cash flow, Netflix said, its primary financial metrics and engagement numbers were more relevant indicators of consumer attitudes.\n\nLumley said the company's decision may have been based on a desire to tone down knee-jerk investor reactions to subscriber growth and better showcase its fundamental operating numbers.\n\n\"So much focus on one metric can kind of detract from the other growth drivers that Netflix has going for it,\" he said.\n\nWhatever the case, Lumley said customer surveys indicate Netflix's reputation in a fiercely competitive industry is strong, even when consumers are looking to cut back on entertainment spending.\n\n\"Netflix tends to be one of the streaming platforms they hold on to,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greg_mckenna@fortune.com", "name": "Greg McKenna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

It stated:\n\nThis new interface provides more visible title information at a glance -- including synopsis, genre and ratings. Title previews are also larger and more dynamic, with more immersive trailers and bigger box art to make browsing easier.\n\nThe company also mentioned its efforts in releasing video games, mostly on mobile devices. Netflix says it will now release one new game a month, with many of them based on Netflix's movies and TV shows like Too Hot to Handle, Emily in Paris, and Selling Sunset.

With this setup, they see the ad tier becoming a primary growth driver in 2026.\n\nThey reiterated their 'Outperform' rating and $725 price target on the stock.\n\n\"We think Netflix has reached the right formula with global content creation, balancing costs, and increasing profitability,\" they wrote.\n\n\"With further catalysts ahead, such as complete digestion of the advertising potential of upcoming live events, including NFL games and WWE in 2025 and beyond, and gaming expansion into more licensed IP, we maintain our $725 price target.\"", "source": {"uri": "proactiveinvestors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Proactiveinvestors NA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_jarvie@proactiveinvestors.com", "name": "Emily Jarvie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_revenue_per_user", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Average revenue per user"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Churn rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free_Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free Classifieds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI0XzA3XC8yMDI0LTA3LTE5LTEwLTQ2LTEzLTEyYzkwODA0YWVlOTJmMmQ5YjRmN2I0MzhhMDM3MjQ3LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The adjustment follows Netflix's second-quarter earnings report for 2024, which showcased a stronger-than-expected increase in subscribers but presented a varied perspective on future revenue.\n\nNetflix management has continued to outperform in operating margins, capitalizing on revenue growth and the effectiveness of past and current content investments. The company's strategy for the second half of 2024 is clear: they aim to boost revenue through subscriber growth, which is expected to benefit from a mix of advertising and new initiatives to manage shared passwords.\n\nAdditionally, Netflix is focused on maintaining a solid and potentially increasing operating margin and has pledged to continue returning free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks.\n\nThe analyst's commentary highlighted Netflix's transition from a business primarily driven by subscriber numbers to one emphasizing consistent revenue growth, competitive market positioning, expanding margins, and capital returns.\n\nLooking ahead, the array of business and product strategies in place could position Netflix as a company capable of sustained double-digit revenue growth with margin expansion in the years ahead.\n\nDespite the positive outlook on Netflix's long-term prospects, the firm views the risk/reward balance for the shares as even at their current price level. Consequently, while the price target has been increased, the Neutral rating remains unchanged, indicating a cautious stance on the stock's immediate investment potential.\n\nIn other recent news, Netflix disclosed its second quarter financial outcomes, revealing an increased earnings per share (EPS) projection for 2024 by 4%, as noted by Deutsche Bank (ETR:DBKGn). However, the bank also cautioned investors about a potential deceleration in revenue, operating income, and EPS growth in the upcoming year.\n\nNetflix is also making strategic moves to increase its live offerings, including developing an in-house advertising technology platform in partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nAnalyst firms have been active in their assessments of the company's performance. Loop Capital maintained a Buy rating, citing Netflix's continued dominance in the streaming industry. Guggenheim, noting strong member growth, increased its price target for Netflix to $735, while Rosenblatt kept a neutral stance.\n\nAs Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) navigates through its strategic initiatives for the latter half of 2024, real-time data from InvestingPro provides a clear picture of its financial health. With a market cap of $277.09 billion and a P/E ratio standing at 43.92, Netflix demonstrates significant size and investor confidence relative to its earnings. The company's PEG ratio, which combines the P/E ratio with expected earnings growth, is at an attractive 0.79, indicating potential for future earnings to justify the current price level.\n\nInvestingPro Tips suggest that Netflix is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, which may appeal to value-oriented investors looking for growth potential at reasonable prices. Additionally, the company's prominent position in the entertainment industry, coupled with the ability of its cash flows to sufficiently cover interest payments, underscores its financial stability and competitive edge.\n\nFor readers interested in a deeper analysis, there are more than 10 additional InvestingPro Tips available, which could offer further insights into Netflix's valuation and performance metrics.

The move comes as solid growth in its global memberships and strong second-quarter results benefited the streaming media major to issue significantly positive third-quarter outlook and to hike fiscal 2024 revenue and margin view.\n\nNetflix's lowest-priced ad-free streaming plan for $11.99 a month has been discontinued, its U.S. website shows. The basic plan subscribers are asked to choose a new plan, at $6.99 per month ad-supported plan or ad-free Standard or Premium plans. Ad-free Standard plan comes at $15.49 per month, while Premium plan comes at $22.99 per month.\n\nCo-CEO Gregory Peters, during the company's earnings call for the second quarter, said, \"We've had the confidence to move forward with that change in the U.S. and France so that's an indicator of how it's going.\"\n\nHe was responding to a question about early results from phasing out the basic tier in a handful of Netflix's markets. The company had withdrawn its basic sign-up option in the UK and Canada last year.\n\nWhile talking about the successful ad-supported offering, Peters further said, \"we've got a very strong offering for our members. Essentially, we're providing them a better experience, 2 streams versus 1. We've got higher definition, we got downloads. And of course, all at a lower price, $6.99 in the United States, we think that represents a tremendous entertainment value. And it includes ads.\"\n\nNetflix further said it is making steady progress scaling its ad business with ad-tier memberships growing 34 percent sequentially. The company added that it is building an in-house ad tech platform that will be tested in Canada in 2024 and launch more broadly in 2025.\n\nAccording to the firm, the sustained progress indicate that it is on track to achieve critical ad subscriber scale for advertisers in its ad countries in 2025, creating a strong base from which it can further increase ad membership in 2026 and beyond.\n\nFor Netflix, advertising is not considered to be a primary driver of its revenue growth in 2024 or 2025, while it will be a key component of its longer-term revenue and profit growth.\n\nThe company, among its peers, enjoys a sold streaming subscriber number, with the second- quarter global streaming paid memberships reaching 277.65 million, a growth of 16.5 percent from the prior year. The company added 8.05 million new susbcribers in the quarter, significantly higher than a year ago.\n\nOn the earnings front, the media major reported sold earnings in its second quarter, above market estimates, with strong growth in revenues. The bottom line came in at $2.15 billion or $4.88 per share, higher than $1.49 billion or $3.29 per share a year ago. This is compared to the Street estimate of $4.74 per share. Revenue rose 16.8 percent year-over-year to $9.56 billion.\n\nLooking ahead to the third quarter, the company projects net income of $2.24 billion or $5.10 per share, higher than the prior year's $1.68 billion or $3.73 per share.\n\nRevenue growth is projected to be 14 percent year-over-year to $9.73 billion. The increase would be 19 percent at constant currency basis.\n\nMeanwhile, paid net additions are expected to be lower than last year, which had the first full quarter impact from paid sharing.\n\nFor the full year 2024, Netflix now expects revenue growth of 14 percent to 15 percent, up from 13 percent to 15 percent expected previously. The updated revenue forecast reflects solid membership growth trends and business momentum.\n\nOperating margin is now expected to be 26 percent, higher than the previous estimate of 25 percent, due to the improved revenue outlook and ongoing expense discipline.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix,_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/ustopstories/2024/july/netflix-july19-lt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

With this setup, they see the ad tier becoming a primary growth driver in 2026.\n\nThey reiterated their 'Outperform' rating and $725 price target on the stock.\n\n\"We think Netflix has reached the right formula with global content creation, balancing costs, and increasing profitability,\" they wrote.\n\n\"With further catalysts ahead, such as complete digestion of the advertising potential of upcoming live events, including NFL games and WWE in 2025 and beyond, and gaming expansion into more licensed IP, we maintain our $725 price target.\"", "source": {"uri": "proactiveinvestors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Proactiveinvestors NA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angela_harmantas@proactiveinvestors.com", "name": "Angela Harmantas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "emily_jarvie@proactiveinvestors.com", "name": "Emily Jarvie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_revenue_per_user", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Average revenue per user"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Churn rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free_Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free Classifieds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI0XzA3XC8yMDI0LTA3LTE5LTEwLTQ2LTEzLTEyYzkwODA0YWVlOTJmMmQ5YjRmN2I0MzhhMDM3MjQ3LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Instead of focusing on its content's quality and developing useful features, the company has been busy exploring new ways to inconvenience its users. Following the password-sharing crackdown, Netflix is now discontinuing its cheapest ad-free plan in the US and France.\n\nNetflix announced through its second quarter earnings report (via The Verge) that it will phase out its $11.99 Basic plan in the US and France. The change was first tested in the UK and Canada, pushing users to watch ads on a cheaper tier or pay more for the ad-free Standard and Premium plans.\n\nWhile the Basic plan was first dropped in the US a year ago, those who already subscribed were allowed to retain the tier for as long as they continued to pay. With Netflix now completely killing this tier, existing subscribers must pick between the ad-supported $6.99 plan or the ad-free ones offered for $15.49 and $22.99. Alternatively, they can cancel their subscriptions and look into a better streaming service.\n\nThis change makes business sense, as over 45% of new subscribers reportedly opt for the ad-supported tier. Prompting users to pick between ads or pricier plans is a win-win strategy that could help Netflix boost its earnings in the coming months.\n\nBeyond killing its cheapest ad-free plan, Netflix is also testing ads that appear on the pause screen. Additionally, the company will start measuring its growth by regional revenue rather than number of new subscribers.", "source": {"uri": "androidauthority.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Authority"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Netflix-logo-on-smartphone-next-to-other-devices-stock-photo-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

In a letter to shareholders, Netflix further added that India was the third largest country for the streaming giant in terms of revenue percent growth for the quarter. The company however didn't disclose any specific subscriber or revenue numbers for the Indian market.\n\nThe growth in India was driven by big successful original titles such as Sanjay Leela Bansali's Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar and Imtiaz Ali's Amar Singh Chamkila during the quarter, Netflix said in the shareholder letter.\n\nLicensed films such as Kiran Rao's Laapataa Ladies and the Ajay Devgn and Madhavan-starrer Shaitaan also helped the growth of the streaming service in the country.\n\nAlso read: We have been broadening our audience with our content slate: Netflix's Monika Shergill\n\nNetflix added 8.05 million subscribers across the world during the second quarter of 2024, out of which 2.83 million users came from the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. The APAC region, which includes India, was Netflix's biggest geography in terms of member additions.\n\nThe region's revenue grew to $1.05 billion, up 14.5 percent from the same quarter last year. Netflix's overall revenue rose to $9.56 billion for the quarter, a 16.8 percent growth over last year.\n\nIn the letter, Netflix mentioned that Heeramandi was Netflix's biggest Indian drama series ever with 15 million views during the quarter. The title was renewed for a second season in June. The Diljit Dosanjh-starrer Amar Singh Chamkila also registered 8.3 million views during the quarter.\n\n\"I think India's growth is a story that we see around the world playing out similarly.

If we pick them well, we programme well, we improve the product market fit, we improve engagement, we grow members, we grow revenue,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a post-earnings video interview.\n\nNetlflix has been struggling to increase its foothold in the India market for the past few years - even as India is the second largest internet market in the world. In a bid to drive subscriber growth Netflix had cut its prices by 20-60 percent in India in December 2021.\n\nThe streaming giant is also set to face stiff competition in the country, following Reliance Industries' joint venture with Disney, which combines the businesses of Viacom18 and Star India.\n\nAlso read: Netflix's Indian content garners over 1 billion views in 2023SHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on July 19, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amar_Singh_Chamkila", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amar Singh Chamkila"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajay_Devgn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ajay Devgn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viacom18", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viacom18"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Sarandos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Sarandos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliance_Industries", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reliance Industries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/46vcuw/article68421005.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/DCX_DownloadUtils_7wd1dpbm0zl12ujd8nq4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 2691, "textEnd": 2698}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

This move comes as part of the streaming giant's ongoing strategy to reconfigure its pricing model and push more users towards its ad-supported tiers.\n\nThe writing was on the wall since January when Netflix announced it would be discontinuing the Basic plan in certain regions by the second quarter of 2024. Originally, only subscribers in the U.K. and Canada received pop-up notifications informing them they have until July 13 to either select a new subscription plan or face a blank screen where their favorite shows used to be. The message is clear: \"Basic plan has been discontinued.\"\n\nNow thought, Netflix has confirmed that subscribers in the US and around the world will need to pay more or switch to an ad-supported plan. If they don't they will stop getting access to Netflix.\n\nThe exact date for when you will need to switch plans or lose access in the United States has not been announced yet. Netflix did confirm the change was coming in its quarterly earnings yesterday but stopped short of saying when.\n\nWith the Basic plan off the table, subscribers are now left with a few choices, each with its own set of trade-offs. Here's a breakdown of what's available:\n\nWhile Netflix hasn't provided a crystal-clear reason for axing the Basic plan, but it's likely a strategic move to drive more subscribers towards its ad-supported tiers. After all, ads mean additional revenue streams, and Netflix has realized that ad-supported accounts might be more lucrative than ad-free ones. This shift aligns with their 2023 earnings call, which highlighted the financial benefits of having users on the ad-supported tier.\n\nPredictably, the reaction on social media has been swift and vocal. Many subscribers have taken to platforms like Reddit to express their displeasure. Comments range from mild annoyance to outright frustration, with users lamenting the loss of a budget-friendly, ad-free option.\n\nIf you're currently on the Basic plan and haven't seen the notification yet, consider yourself lucky - for now. However, it's likely only a matter of time before you'll need to make a decision: upgrade your plan or prepare to welcome commercials into your streaming life.\n\nNetflix's decision to retire its Basic plan marks a significant shift in its subscription strategy. Whether you're willing to tolerate ads or ready to pay more for an uninterrupted experience, staying informed about your options is key. As the streaming landscape continues to evolve, subscribers will need to adapt to these changes while still enjoying the vast library of content that Netflix has to offer.", "source": {"uri": "cordcuttersnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cord Cutters News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_bouma@cordcuttersnews.com", "name": "Luke Bouma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop-up retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliffhanger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cliffhanger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cordcuttersnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/shutterstock_1836331633-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 630, "textEnd": 637}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

All eyes are on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the dominant streaming giant, reporting its results after the closing bell today.\n\nThis report will be crucial for gauging the health of the streaming industry and could impact the broader market sentiment.\n\nNetflix boasts impressive year-to-date gains, with its stock surging 33%, while competitors like Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) and Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) have fallen 19% and 26%, respectively.\n\nHowever, the streaming giant faces a critical test as its stock has pulled back over 7% since reaching a more than 2-year high of $697.23 earlier this month.\n\nIn this article, we will analyze what investors can expect from the high-stakes earnings release later on today.\n\nIn terms of key data, analysts are forecasting an average EPS of $4.76, almost 10% down on the first quarter, but up 44.6% year-on-year.\n\nSales are expected to reach $9.531 billion, compared with $9.37 billion in the previous quarter and $8.187 billion a year earlier, representing an annual growth of 14.4%.\n\nBeyond these main figures, investors will also be interested in some specific details of Netflix's results, starting with the number of new subscribers, which is expected to be 4.7 million, compared with 5.9 million last year.\n\nMore specifically, we'll be looking at subscriber growth for the discounted, ad-supported plan, bearing in mind that the company has raised the prices of its other subscriptions to steer more subscribers towards the ad-supported version, deemed more profitable.\n\nOf course, the company's forecasts for the coming quarters could largely mitigate or accentuate the impact of Q2 results, given that optimistic forecasts could offset disappointing results, and vice versa. It's worth remembering that Netflix shares plummeted following the publication of a Q1 EPS that was 16% higher than expected, precisely because of cautious forecasts.\n\nIt's also worth noting that some analysts are wary of Netflix's upcoming results. Goldman's Eric Sheridan, who has a neutral rating on the stock, warned last week that \"based on Sensor Tower data, in the US and globally, Netflix experienced a decline in app downloads during the quarter\".\n\nFor their part, analysts at Citi, who are also neutral on Netflix, estimated that the company \"will report net additions slightly ahead of estimates, but slightly below expectations from investors\", who \"will likely continue to focus on the company's advertising, sports content and capital allocation strategy.\"\n\nAs for targets for Netflix's share price, analysts also show a mixed view, with an average target of $665.94, which translates into a very limited upside potential of +2.8% from Wednesday's closing price.\n\nValuation models are also sending out a message of caution, with InvestingPro Fair Value (an intelligent synthesis of several recognized models) coming in at $633.44, or 2.2% below the current price.\n\nNetflix is therefore approaching its earnings release at fairly high levels, and analysts' expectations in terms of profits and revenues are also high, implying that the balance of risks is tilted to the downside.\n\nWhat's more, beyond the influence of the results on Netflix's share price, this publication could also have an impact on the technology sector in general, given that optimism is already starting to wane, with Nasdaq falling by almost 3% yesterday on its worst day since December 2022.\n\n***\n\nAre you tired of watching the big players rake in profits while you're left on the sidelines?\n\nInvestingPro's revolutionary AI tool, ProPicks, puts the power of Wall Street's secret weapon - AI-powered stock selection - at YOUR fingertips!\n\nDon't miss this limited-time offer.\n\nSubscribe to InvestingPro today and take your investing game to the next level!", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Subscriber additions nearly doubled estimates of a gain of 4.7 million, which would have represented a dip from the 5.9 million tacked on in Q2 of 2023.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nThe company said revenue would rise 14% in the third quarter ending September 30, with a lower rate of subscriber growth than the third quarter of 2023, which included the first full-quarter hit from paid password sharing. Average revenue per subscriber, meanwhile, will come in flat in the next quarter, due to what the company described as \"ongoing F/X headwinds and plan and country mix.\"\n\nThe results reflect another active stretch for the leader in the s reaming business. During the quarter, the company hosted its first upfront presentation for advertisers in New York and also planted a flag in live sports, announcing rights to Christmas Day NFL games starting this year. Its core business of delivering original series and films has also been on a steady track, highlighted by a third season for Bridgerton, which has quickly become one of the most-viewed titles in company history.\n\nHistorically, the second quarter has seen the least subscriber additions of any quarter, just given the traditional peak periods for programming. The latest numbers were not quite the blockbuster event of last quarter, when Netflix added more than 9 million subscribers to reach almost 270 million global customers. Even so, Netflix has continued to put its dark days of late-2021 and 2022 further into the rear-view mirror.

One of the ways many platforms are starting to do this is by bundling with other streaming platforms, along with banks, mobile phone providers and cable companies.\n\nDisney has already had lots of success with bundles, including offering Disney+ with Spectrum cable and with many phone providers. Plus, the Disney Streaming Bundle, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, has been a huge benefit in reducing churn. Disney is also planning on launching a new bundle later this year with Max and the new sports platform Venu.\n\nToday, to go alongside the release of the latest quarterly results, Netflix released a letter to shareholders, which addressed the idea of bundling Netflix with other streaming services like Disney+ or Max.\n\n\"From the early days of streaming, we saw partnerships with device makers and pay TV and mobile operators as key to ensuring Netflix was easy to find and use. These partnerships are a win-win -- making it simple for people to discover, sign-up, use and pay for Netflix. In turn, our device and operator partners benefit through increased device sales from consumers seeking devices integrated with Netflix and greater customer acquisition and higher retention as well as the opportunity to upsell higher value data or content packages. We haven't bundled Netflix solely with other streamers like Disney+ or Max because Netflix already operates as a go-to destination for entertainment thanks to the breadth and variety of our slate and superior product experience. This has driven industry leading penetration, engagement and retention for us, which limits the benefit to Netflix of bundling directly with other streamers.\"\n\nHowever, in the small print of the release, they stated, \"In some partnerships, operators may include other streaming services in a bundle with Netflix and the operator's services,\"\n\nThis ties in with today's other new announcement, where Peacock is now available in a new bundle with Netflix, which is only available for Verizon customers, who purchase a year of Peacock Premium and also get a year of Netflix Premium at no extra charge.\n\nRoger's Take: There has been lots of discussion about many of the studios wanting to team back up to bundle their streaming services together to recreate the cable system. However, from Netflix's point of view, they are the king of streaming, and they don't need to team up with any other studio to bundle since they are already the default choice. With many of the major studios looking to license out their content to Netflix, they don't need to do so, but that doesn't mean cable and phone providers can't start putting together their own bundles to try to keep customers on their networks.\n\nDo you think Netflix will bundle with Disney+?

The figure jumped 48.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nRevenues of $9.55 billion increased 16.8% year over year and beat the consensus mark by 0.29%, driven primarily by a 16% year-over-year increase in average paid memberships.\n\nOn the ads front, ads tier membership grew 34% quarter over quarter. Netflix is building an in-house ad tech platform that will be tested in Canada this year and will launch more broadly in 2025.\n\nThe company's crackdown on password sharing and the introduction of a lower-priced subscriber plan with advertising propelled Netflix to its second-best first half, trailing only the pandemic-fueled boom in 2020.\n\nNetflix, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Netflix, Inc. Quote\n\nAt the end of the second quarter, Netflix had 277.65 million paid subscribers across more than 190 countries globally, up 16.5% year over year.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company reported an increase of 8.05 million paid subscribers globally in the second quarter, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per membership (ARM) on a reported basis and 5% growth on foreign-exchange neutral basis in the second quarter. It gained 5.89 million paid subscribers in the year-ago quarter. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThe company credited second-quarter gains to the strength of its intellectual property, including a wide variety of hit series like Bridgerton Season 3 (98.5 million views), Spanish investigative TV thriller The Asunta Case (31.3 million views), the crime series Crooks from Germany (15.7 million views), which just renewed for a second season.\n\nOther series that contributed to the company's second-quarter results are Queen of Tears (29.3 million views) from Korea as well as the sci-fi action movie Atlas starring Jennifer Lopez (79.3M views), the acclaimed comedy Hit Man (33.2 million views) and City Hunter (16.5 million views) and a live-action adaptation of the Japanese manga. The Roast of Tom Brady (22.6 million views) attracted one of the largest live audiences yet.\n\nAudiences were enthralled by the British hit drama Baby Reindeer (88.4 million views and 11 Emmy nominations), which, like The Gentleman, One Day and Fool Me Once, spent multiple weeks on global TV Top 10 list. In the second quarter, India was No. 2 and 3 country in terms of paid net adds and revenue percent growth, respectively, helped by big successful titles like Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar (15.0 million views), Netflix's biggest Indian drama series ever, and Amar Singh Chamkila (8.3 million views), as well as licensed films like Laapataa Ladies and Shaitaan.\n\nNetflix is now looking to expand into new areas, such as live events and gaming, in a bid to cement its dominance in the streaming age. The company expects upcoming events like Joe Rogan: Burn the Boats, Chestnut vs Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef, the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson boxing match as well as weekly WWE programming starting in 2025 to build on that. In May, Netflix announced that it would be the home for both Christmas Day NFL games this year and have exclusive rights to at least one of the NFL Christmas games in 2025 and 2026, besides its $5 billion deal to stream WWE's flagship wrestling show, Raw.\n\nNetflix has also partnered with Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto, the wildly popular action-adventure video game franchise, to further push into the video game space. In the second quarter, the company added Virgin River and Perfect Match to its gaming roster. Starting in July, NFLX will launch about one new title per month like Emily in Paris and Selling Sunset.\n\nNFLX will stop reporting paid quarterly membership and revenue per subscriber, starting with the first quarter of 2025. While tech giants like Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN do not reveal subscriber figures for their respective streaming services, other media companies do. Disney DIS separately breaks out Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ figures.\n\nShares of NFLX have returned 32.1% in the year-to-date (YTD) period and outperformed Apple, Amazon, Disney and the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. Apple, Amazon, Disney and the sector have returned 16.4%, 21.4%, 7.2% and 16.7%, respectively, in the same time frame.\n\nThe United States and Canada (UCAN) reported revenues of $4.29 billion, which rose 19.3% year over year and accounted for 44.9% of total revenues.

The company gained 1.45 million paid subscribers compared with the year-ago quarter's gain of 1.17 million.\n\nEurope, Middle East & Africa (EMEA) reported revenues of $3 billion, which increased 17.4% year over year and accounted for 31.5% of total revenues. ARPU decreased 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe paid subscriber base for EMEA climbed 17.7% from the year-ago quarter to 93.96 million.

It gained 1.53 million paid subscribers in the reported quarter, while the company lost 1.21 million subscribers in the year-ago period.\n\nAsia Pacific's (APAC) revenues of $1.05 billion increased 14.4% year over year and accounted for 11% of total revenues. ARPU decreased 6.4% year over year.\n\nThe paid subscriber base for APAC jumped 24.1% from the year-ago quarter to 50.23 million. The company added 2.82 million paid subscribers in the quarter.\n\nMarketing expenses increased 2.7% year over year to $644.1 million. As a percentage of revenues, marketing expenses contracted 90 basis points (bps) to 6.7%.\n\nOperating income increased 42.5% year over year to $2.6 billion. Operating margin expanded 490 bps on a year-over-year basis to 27.2%.\n\nNetflix had $6.24 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of Jun 30, 2024 compared with $7.02 billion as of Mar 31, 2024.\n\nTotal debt was $13.98 billion as of Jun 30, 2024 compared with $14.01 billion as of Mar 31, 2024.\n\nStreaming content obligations were $23.31 billion as of Jun 30, 2024 compared with $24.2 billion as of Mar 31, 2024.\n\nNetflix reported a free cash flow of $1.21 billion compared with a free cash flow of $2.13 billion in the previous quarter.\n\nDuring the quarter, Netflix repurchased 2.6 million shares for $1.6 billion and has $5 billion remaining under existing authorization.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, Netflix forecasts revenues to increase 14%, which equates to 19% growth on an F/X neutral basis, due to price changes in Argentina and the devaluation of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe company anticipates total revenues to be $9.727 billion, suggesting growth of 13.9% year over year. The consensus mark for revenues is pinned at $9.53 billion, lower than the company's expectation.\n\nNFLX has projected earnings of $5.1 per share, suggesting growth of 36.7% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $4.7 per share, currently lower than the company's expectation.\n\nNetflix expects paid net additions to be lower than third-quarter 2023, which had the first full quarter impact from paid sharing. Like recent quarters, the company forecasts global ARM on a reported basis to be roughly flat year over year in the third quarter due to ongoing F/X headwinds and plan and country mix.\n\nFor 2024, NFLX expects healthy revenue growth of 14-15% based on F/X rates at the end of the second quarter of 2024, up from 13-15% reported previously. The updated revenue forecast reflects solid membership growth trends and business momentum.\n\nThe company now expects the full-year 2024 operating margin to be 26% (based on F/X rates as of Jan 1, 2024), up from the prior forecast of 25%, due to the improved revenue outlook and ongoing expense discipline.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The technology group touches every part of Netflix -- spanning not just the core product experience, but also advertising, games, livestreaming content and studio production organizations.\n\n\"The greatest complexity comes from the fact that our team supports all areas of the business,\" she says in the latest episode of Variety's \"Strictly Business\" podcast. \"And it means we've got partnerships across all of Netflix.\"\n\nListen to the podcast here:\n\nStone first joined the company in 2020 and became VP of data and insights, before she was named CTO in October 2023, becoming the first Netflix exec to hold that title. She has a background in economics with a PhD from Stanford (and she once worked as a trader at Merrill Lynch), which is very unusual for a top-level tech exec.\n\n\"I feel like I use my economics background on almost a daily basis,\" says Stone. As she notes, \"We don't have endless resources. So we want to spend our time and energy and dollars on things that are going to be most impactful for Netflix.\"\n\nNetflix has long used machine learning and artificial intelligence, which have powered the core of its personalized recommendations. In the last few years, generative AI -- which creates text, images, videos or other data, based on a vast databases of source material -- has exploded into the mainstream. Stone says the gen AI wave is \"a step function in that technology\" and that Netflix is exploring how to integrate it into the product to improve the member experience or how it could \"enable creators and bring their visions to life in an even better way.\"\n\nOne new AI project she says Netflix is working on now is an \"interactive discovery experience.\" Is it an AI chatbot, \u00e0 la OpenAI's ChatGPT? Not exactly. Without describing it in detail, Stone says it's \"a way to think about organizing the catalog, which is so big, into something that feels more tractable for members to help them discover things, and reshaping the moment or understanding of what a member is looking for. So we're working on prototypes of that.\"\n\nWhen will it see the light of day? Possibly soon: \"We're still working on that internally to make sure that it's a really good experience for members before we have members trying it themselves,\" Stone says.\n\nNetflix's technology prowess has admirers across the industry -- including Disney chief Bob Iger, who earlier this year acknowledged that the Mouse House needs \"to be at their level in terms of technology capability.\"\n\n\"I think Netflix's superpower for a long time has been the way that technology can be so valuable for entertainment, and can bring an innovation to entertainment that's really appealing to consumers,\" Stone says. \"I agree with Bob Iger that Netflix has, I think, a strength that is very important that we maintain.\"\n\nStone says part of the culture at Netflix, especially in the technology team, is to think about what's best for the business. \"And that's a motivator for the team, versus feeling like, you know, we've got people nipping at our heels, and we feel the pressure to stay ahead. But you know, we're also a business and we're hoping to be successful, which means you do have to have some real drive to do an even better job than what the competition's doing. So I hope we keep that drive.\"\n\nOne of the top priorities for Stone and the Netflix tech team is improving its capabilities to deliver live content -- particularly with its biggest move yet into live sports later this year: two NFL games on Christmas Day 2024.\n\nNetflix has learned a lot since the \"Love Is Blind\" live reunion special in April 2023 failed to launch. It's a \"distant memory, thankfully, because it's a painful one for many of us on the team,\" Stone says. \"I think the thing about 'Love Is Blind' is that it was a good reminder of how complicated it really is to deliver live well at scale. And it can seem like it should be an easy thing, because broadcasters around the world do this every day.\" But, she says, \"being able to adapt the way Netflix has optimized streaming video-on-demand for streaming live content is complex... We've gained a ton of amazing learnings around just how to ensure greater reliability and stability for members who are watching and even operational aspects of things.\" Netflix has applied those learnings to more recent live events, like the Tom Brady roast this past May, \"so that gives us some preparation for NFL but it's still a big challenge ahead of us that the team has to be really focused on.\"\n\nOn the podcast, Stone also talks about Netflix's famous corporate culture, the \"no rules\" philosophy that co-founder Reed Hastings established in its early days. As spelled out in Netflix's culture memo, which the company updated last month, the framework includes the \"keeper test,\" which encourages managers to part ways with employees if the answer is \"no\" to the question, \"If X wanted to leave, would I fight to keep them?\"\n\n\"It's not difficult to adapt to when everyone's doing it,\" Stone says. \"So what I find about Netflix is, if you find that your peers are being candid with you -- what you're doing well, where you could be doing better -- you feel like you're invested in each other's success.\" When Stone was interviewing at Netflix, she says, that radical honesty \"sounded like a fascinating and great fit for me with what I was looking for.\"\n\nBut Netflix has had to evolve its \"no rules rules\" to, well, add some kinds of process framework. Today, Netflix is a bigger company than even when Stone joined in April 2020. \"We've had to change some of the operating practices just so we stay effective as a company,\" she says. \"So one of the things that's evolved since I've been here is more leadership conversation and communication around, 'Here's what's top-of-mind for us this year.' And that provides some structure for how many, many teams think about, 'Well, then this is what we should do to nest into these company priorities.'\" That's not a rule or mandate per se, Stone says, but \"it's guidance that I think allows people to feel more aligned across thousands of people.\"", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Iger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Iger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roku", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Database"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Hastings", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reed Hastings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Elizabeth-Stone-Netflix-CTO.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-04-", "textStart": 5710, "textEnd": 5720}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

The company's Q2 revenue stood firm at $9.56 billion, aligning with estimates, while diluted per-share earnings hit $4.88, beating forecasts of $4.74. The ad-supported tier saw a notable 34% subscriber increase, fueled by the password-sharing crackdown, price hikes on ad-free tiers, and new bundles like Comcast's 'StreamSaver.' Netflix's ad business is growing but isn't expected to propel major revenue gains in the short term.

That decision reflects what Sarandos called Netflix's \"event model\" where it could draw subscribers' attention to a few very specific games to watch.\n\n\"It creates a lot of real excitement with the service and it's one day of football,\" he said on the earnings call.\n\nThe NFL would be one of Netflix's first moves into regular-season sports. So far, its other live events have been exhibition matches. Nonetheless, they have been high-profile fixtures like the Netflix Slam matchup between Spanish tennis players Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz, and the Netflix Cup celebrity golf tournament that also featured pro golfers. In November, Netflix will air the long-delayed celebrity boxing match between former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and YouTuber Jake Paul.\n\nNetflix also has a slate of sports documentaries, which it considers a part of its overall sports strategy, like Formula 1: Drive to Survive, The Redeem Team about the 2008 Olympic basketball team, and Beckham about English soccer legend David Beckham.\n\nNetflix's targeted approach stands out in a time when the broadcasting rights for sports leagues are soaring, as they remain one of the only reliable ways to drive viewers to live television (or streaming). Sports leagues, well aware of the negotiating power they have with both cable companies and streamers, have been squeezing broadcast partners, demanding higher fees for fewer games.\n\nThe NBA is in the home stretch of negotiating an 11-year, $76 billion media deal with Disney, Comcast, and Amazon that would leave out its long-time partner Warner Bros. Discovery. That's up from the previous $24 billion deal reached in 2014.\n\nHistorically, the NBA only had two broadcasters: Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. But this time around, the league made clear it intended to sell three packages, meaning each media company would have fewer games to air. Reports indicate that Warner Bros. Discovery initially balked at the cost, before later trying to scramble to patch things up with the NBA once it became clear competitors were more than willing to pay the asking price. The NFL also went to streaming for the first time in its latest 11-year, $110 billion deal that saw it air games on Amazon Prime Video and on Peacock.\n\nIt appears Netflix wanted to avoid getting into such bidding wars with other media companies.\n\n\"It's very difficult to have big league sports and profit when you offer them in entire seasons. But when you offer them in this event model that we're building, we're really excited about the opportunity to do that without the risk\" of becoming beholden to sports league at renewal, Sarandos said in response to a question about the negotiating strength of leagues.\n\nNetflix does have one league-wide deal with World Wrestling Entertainment, which it signed in January for $5 billion over 10 years. Sarandos said Netflix bought those rights because they were at a favorable price and part of a long-term deal that could stretch up to 20 years due to an option in the contract.\n\nThis isn't the first time Netflix and Sarandos have expressed wariness to engage in the lengthy, and according to them, overpriced standard live sports agreements. As recently as October 2023, Sarandos was calling those sorts of deals rentals that didn't lead to profits. \"We're not anti-sports,\" he said on a Netflix earning call at the time. \"We're just pro-profit. We have yet to figure out how to do it.\"\n\nOutside of sports Netflix has branched out more into live entertainment programming, like stand-up comedy acts and talk shows, over the past year. Comedians Katt Williams and Chris Rock both had live comedy specials, while John Mulaney hosted a week's worth of live talk shows on the streamer. One of Netflix's major live hits was The Roast of Tom Brady, which climbed into Netflix's U.S. Top Ten on the first night it aired. The common thread among all of Netflix's live entertainment, according to Sarandos, is that it's what the audience's and advertisers want.\n\n\"It drives a ton of engagement and it drives a ton of excitement, and those two things are very valuable,\" he said Thursday. \"The good thing is that advertisers like that too, and they like it for the exact same reason -- the excitement and the engagement.\"\n\nNetflix's push into live entertainment and sports goes hand-in-hand with the launch of its ad-supported tier. Live entertainment, particularly when it's exclusive, can make streaming with ads feel like a better deal. Sports in particular lend themselves easily to commercial breaks, during pauses for timeouts and halftime.\n\nThere's also some early evidence from Netflix's competitors that when audiences watch live sports on streaming they're less likely to flip channels during commercials like they used to on cable. The NFL found that audiences watching Thursday night games on Amazon watched the broadcast for 12% longer than those who did on linear television, according to Nielsen data.\n\nThat said, at least one industry analyst was lukewarm about Netflix's forays into live sports. \"We believe Netflix should avoid going down a path that could put it in a similar position as the legacy media companies, where it feels compelled to retain sports rights with costs that become an outsize portion of its content budget,\" Morningstar analyst Matthew Doglin told the Hollywood Reporter in May.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paolo_confino@fortune.com", "name": "Paolo Confino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The company is now asking its users to choose a new Netflix plan to continue watching content on the world's largest streamer.\n\nNetflix is finalizing its plans to completely phase out its cheapest ad-free subscription tier for its existing subscribers, reports Giant Freakin Robot. The company is now asking its users to choose a new Netflix plan to continue watching content on the world's largest streamer.\n\nNetflix users took their dissatisfaction with Netflix's action to Reddit, where they discussed the new development. Apparently, those subscribed to the Basic Netflix plan, which is currently priced at $11.99 per month, will soon have to choose to either switch to a new Basic plan priced at $6.99 or a Standard plan for $15.49. Seems like a no-brainer, considering that the new price of a Basic plan is now more than 40% cheaper, but the downside is that the new Basic plan is supported by ads.\n\nYes, you read that right: The new Netflix plan, the one we previously paid for to avoid pesky advertisements, now contains the ads. However, the equivalent service to the soon-abandoned Basic plan is now called Standard, and its price went up by almost 30%. Now, it's important to note that most of the users receiving notifications about the price hike are located in the U.K. and Canada. This actually reflects Netflix's previous announcement regarding the discontinuation of the old Basic plan we all came to love.\n\nHowever, the company still hasn't revealed when it will phase out the Basic plan for the existing U.S. subscribers and implement the new Netflix plans and prices. The newly formed subscription plans are priced at $6.99 for the ad-supported Basic plan, $15.49 for the Standard, and a 4K Premium plan that is completely ad-free and costs $22.99. But -- and there's always some \"but\" rearing its ugly head -- things aren't really as they seem, as more and more companies engage in mandatory arbitrations.\n\nNamely, Netflix is now increasing the price of its former Basic plan and renaming it into Standard. Simultaneously, the company is introducing a new, ad-supported Basic plan, which, while more affordable, also implies that the company will collect data about its viewers and serve up ads based on the data it collected, thus earning not only money from subscriptions but also from advertisers. So, you can either pay more money for a new Netflix plan or choose a more affordable one and suffer all the annoying ads that go with it.\n\nSure, users can always purchase a 4K Premium for the ultimate experience, but as a prominent Right to Repair activist explained, Netflix only streams 4K content to its closed-source application that comes installed in closed-source Smart TV sets. Otherwise, it's 720p for $22.99 -- the cheaper Standard plan will still deliver 1080p for $11.99, regardless of where and how you watch Netflix. So, while it's well within the company's rights to introduce new Netflix plans, it's important to note that the service delivered isn't always what the service users pay for.\n\nRight to Repair and consumer-protection advocates aside, it's only a matter of time before the new Netflix plan reaches U.S. subscribers. There's no mention of the European Union anywhere, and EU subscribers are currently paying $5.40 for a Basic ad-free plan.", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720p", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "720p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smart TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Business_Plans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Business Plans", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement Planning", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://images.wral.com/asset/entertainment/out_and_about/2023/10/27/21118195/tech-daily-PGuCnUzsRSM-unsplash-DMID1-60qhhuq4p-640x480.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736347", "eventUri": "eng-9736347", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Co-CEO Greg Peters Doesn't Rule It Out, But Says Execs \"Love\" Being \"Lower\"", "body": "Netflix's 18-month-old advertising subscription tier could well see its price ($7 a month in the U.S.) rise in the not-too-distant future, but Co-CEO Greg Peters says execs \"love\" the strategic advantages of the current level.\n\n\"In terms of raising that price, we think about it similar to pricing in general,\" he said on the company's second-quarter earnings call when asked whether the company might consider a rate hike. \"We love having an entry price that's lower. That means we are more accessible to more people in our ads markets. That's a great thing because they can have access to all of the great storytelling we are doing there.\"\n\nIn its quarterly numbers, Netflix posted a better-than-expected increase of 8 million total subscribers over the prior quarter, reaching almost 278 million globally. In its letter to shareholders, the company said its ad tier grew 34% over the first quarter and now accounts for 45% of all subscriptions in the territories where it is available. The company does not formally break out numbers by subscription tier, but said in May that it had reached 40 million monthly active users, up from 23 million in January. (MAUs is a common metric in ad-supported streaming.)\n\n\"It's our job to increase the value to all of our members,\" Peters explained. \"When we have signals from our members - the amount of acquisitions that we've got going on, engagement, what our retention and churn looks like - then we find the right moment to ask our members to pay a little bit more to help us keep that flywheel spinning. We'll think about that in the ads context the same way we would think about it in the non-ads context.\"\n\nEngagement on ads tier is similar to that in ad-free, Peters said, approaching two hours per subscriber per day.\n\nAcross the streaming landscape, prices are rising steadily, with many of the players in the same neighborhood as Netflix recently leapfrogging it to higher entry points for customers. Peacock and Paramount are jumping to $7.99 a month from $5.99 and both are below the lowest tiers of Disney+ and Max. Prime Video this year began inserting ads on all originals unless Prime subscribers opt to pay $3 extra per month to avoid ads. Apple TV+ remains the only major streaming service with no cheaper, ad-free option.\n\nIn the shareholder letter, Netflix said it is \"on track to achieve critical ad subscriber scale for advertisers in our ad countries in 2025, creating a strong base from which we can further increase our ad membership in 2026 and beyond.\" While ad revenue is \"growing nicely and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to our business,\" the letter continued, it won't be a primary revenue driver this year or in 2025.\n\nNetflix is barely two years into its pivot toward advertising, which was hastily unveiled in early 2022 as the company encountered major turbulence, shedding subscribers for the first time in a decade. After years of steadfastly insisting it would never accept ads, mainly for privacy reasons, the company executed a dramatic left turn and made the ad effort a strategic cornerstone.

Last year the company rolled back its least expensive ad-free basic subscription and began warning customers across the US and UK this July that they need to switch to other plans available on the platform.

The Basic plan was the cheapest way to watch Netflix without ads, but in an attempt to push more users to its ad-supported plan, Netflix removed the option to sign up for the Basic plan in January.\n\nIn the ensuing months, Basic plan members in certain regions began receiving messages from Netflix letting them know that they had to pick a new plan. Now, anyone on the Basic plan in the US is about to have to make the same decision.\n\nAfter reporting Q2 2024 earnings on Thursday, Netflix sent a letter to shareholders summarizing the latest quarter. In that letter, Netflix confirmed that Basic plan members in the US and France are going to start being kicked off of the streaming service.\n\n\"Just over 18 months since launch, we continue to scale our ads tier, which now accounts for over 45% of all signups in our ads markets,\" Netflix execs told shareholders. \"Its attractiveness ($6.99 a month in the US, with two streams, high definition and downloads) -- coupled with the phasing out of our Basic plan in the UK and Canada, which we will now start in the US and France -- has increased our ads member base by 34% sequentially in Q2.\"\n\nIf you're still paying for the Basic plan, you might want to start deciding what to do. In the coming days, Netflix is going to ask its Basic plan members in the US to either pick a new plan or cancel their accounts.

Netflix has demonstrated a stronger-than-anticipated growth in its subscriber base, yet the outlook on future revenue has been mixed. Sheridan acknowledges that the management of Netflix has continued to deliver on operating margins, optimizing revenue growth against prior and current content expenditures. The company's strategy going into the second half of 2024 involves maintaining solid revenue growth, harnessing new revenue streams from advertising and password sharing initiatives, and a consistent dedication to returning free cash flow to shareholders through stock buybacks. This progression signals Netflix's transition from a company primarily focused on subscriber growth to one that emphasizes compounded revenue growth, market positioning, margin expansion, and capital returns.\n\nDespite these positive aspects, Sheridan's report suggests a cautious stance in the immediate term, maintaining a Neutral rating while slightly increasing the price target from $650 to $659. The report outlines that while Netflix is set to potentially enjoy sustained double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion in the years ahead, the current valuation of shares presents a balanced risk/reward scenario. This implies that while the future looks promising for Netflix, the present stock price adequately reflects the company's prospects, leading to the Hold rating.\n\nIn another report released on July 16, Barclays also maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a $550.00 price target.\n\nTipRanks tracks over 100,000 company insiders, identifying the select few who excel in timing their transactions.

It's confirmed that it is phasing out its $11.99 monthly Basic pricing plan, leaving subscribers with two options.\n\nThey can either pay less than they do currently, and choose an ad-supported tier for $6.99, or up their monthly outgoings to $15.49 for a Standard plan without adverts. The streamer is suggesting this will let many people save money, but is a takeaway that most people would probably agree is a little optimistic.\n\nA third option is to up the ante and opt for Netflix Premium, which is ad-free and supports 4K HDR content with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, but that's quite a leap up to $22.99 per month.\n\nThis all follows from the exact same process that was enforced at the start of June for UK and Canadian subscribers, who no longer have access to the old Basic plan. Now, the US and France are following suit, and you can safely assume the rollout will continue worldwide eventually.\n\nThis all comes in the context of an earnings report from the giant streamer which confirmed that it had gained just over eight million subscribers in the second quarter of this financial year, taking its total to 277.65 million globally. Those numbers are potentially subject to long-term change, though, after the short-term bump that came in the wake of Netflix's crackdown on password sharing.\n\nInterestingly, though, we might not actually get this sort of insight for a huge amount longer - Netflix has confirmed already that in 2025 it's going to stop reporting its subscriber count and growth. It'll instead simply detail the amount of time viewers spend on its platform.\n\nBack to that Basic plan change, though - if you're wondering what will happen to your subscription when the plan ceases to exist, you'll almost certainly just be rolled onto a Standard with Ads plan at that point.

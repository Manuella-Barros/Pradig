For several decades, the ceramics expert shared his knowledge on 20th Century Roadshow, and Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is and other shows.\n\nHailing from Lancashire, Eric first became a household name through his work on Antiques Roadshow in the 1980s. But his journey into the antiques world was sparked by an unexpected change: he was made redundant from an engineering job in the 1970s. That career pivot led to a renowned TV presence.\n\nWith many fans, many will be wondering about the 71-year-old's rise to fame, his TV career and what he likes doing in his downtime.\n\nWe delve into his life below.\n\nHow Eric Knowles entered the world of antiques\n\nBorn on February 19. 1953 in Nelson, Lancashire, Eric once quipped his career in antiques was \"largely a matter of fate and circumstance\". He was made redundant from his engineering job in Lancashire and took up a role as a porter in the ceramics department of Bonhams Auction House in London in 1976.\n\nJust five years later, he became head of department and was later offered a full directorship. By 1992, Eric had established a Bonhams auction house office in Bristol.\n\nHe later joined Dreweatts and Bloomsbury in 2013, before becoming the executive chairman of The Hoard in 2019.\n\nHe said: \"My career in antiques was largely a matter of fate and circumstance that saw my interest in history and architecture lead me out of redundancy with an engineering company up in my native Lancashire to a job in London as a porter at Bonhams auction house.\"\n\n\"I was to stay with the company for the next 32 years. Working for an auction house guarantees that no two days are ever the same.\"\n\nEric Knowles' TV career\n\nEric first found fame on TV when he regularly appeared as a ceramics expert on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow in the 1980s. But he never thought his role would be so popular, let alone the TV series.\n\n\"When I started doing it I thought this could run for two to three years,\" he previously explained. \"I never thought it would be for 27 years. It is a formula that seems to work. It is always the BBC's most popular factual programme.\"\n\nHis popularity on the BBC show saw him later appear on other daytime shows, including Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is and 20th Century Roadshow.\n\nEric later became a regular guest presenter hosting Bargain Hunt and helped the red and blue teams turn their buys into profit.\n\nOn what his alternative career would be, he said: \"Had I not followed a career in antiques I might have taken two different routes one being in the big outdoors and the Forestry Commission or the indoor studio working in Radio as a DJ.\"\n\nEric's sad family tragedy\n\nEric's personal life was turned upside down when his son Seb died after a car crash in 2015.\n\nSeb Knowles, 26, died after his Mercedes collided with a lorry on the M40 in Buckinghamshire in 2015.\n\nHe worked as a DJ, having supported the Wycombe Wanderers, and played gigs around London under the name DJ Sparky B.\n\nHe had worked with big names like Ultrabeat and The Artful Dodger and had a weekly radio slot on Time FM before he made the move in 2013 to Wycombe Sound.\n\nAt the time, tributes flooded in for Seb, describing him as \"talented\".\n\nOne of which came from the National Association of Disc Jockeys (NADJ) wrote on Facebook: \"All of us at NADJ would like to send our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Seb Knowles (DJ Sparky B) who tragically died earlier today.\"\n\n\"It's always a tragedy when someone is taken so young. He was a talented DJ who will be missed by all who knew him.\"\n\nFrom gardening to writing - Eric Knowles' life outside of TV\n\nEric has been married to his wife Anita Knowles for many years. Anita works as the company secretary for their business, Eric Knowles Antiquarian Services Limited.\n\nThe 71-year-old specialises in ceramics and glass and has opened a gallery, The Pantiles Arcade, in Royal Tunbridge Wells.\n\nHe is also a published author, having covered subjects such as Victoriana, Royal memorabilia, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and Rene Lalique.\n\nHe is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and an Ambassador for the Prince's Trust and works with several other charities including Headway, FABLE (For a better life with epilepsy), the New Mozart Orchestra and Wycombe Scanappeal.\n\nEric has another son called Oliver, and the family prefers to keep out of the spotlight.\n\nExplaining what he enjoys doing in his free time, he added: \"My wife would argue that there is never such a thing as free time.\"\n\n\"But I do enjoy getting stuck into our garden. In truth, I am more of a vegetation controller than a gardener who is always in more need of a machete than a pair of secateurs.\"", "source": {"uri": "devonlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

His rise to fame began on Antiques Roadshow, leading to appearances on other hit shows like 20th Century Roadshow and Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is.\n\nHailing from Lancashire, Eric's journey into the world of antiques was sparked by redundancy in the 1970s, which serendipitously paved the way for his successful television career. He has even opened his gallery, The Pantiles Arcade, to great success.\n\nFans of the 71-year-old presenter are often curious about his backstory, his ascent in the TV world, and how he spends his leisure time.\n\nWe delve into his life below.\n\nEric Knowles' journey into the world of antiques\n\nBorn on February 19, 1953, in Nelson, Lancashire, Eric attributes his foray into the antiques trade to \"largely a matter of fate and circumstance\". After losing his job in engineering, he joined Bonhams Auction House as a porter in their ceramics department in 1976.\n\nWithin five years, he climbed the ranks to head of department and eventually earned a directorship. By 1992, he had set up a Bonhams office in Bristol.\n\nHis career continued to flourish when he moved to Dreweatts and Bloomsbury in 2013, and later took on the role of executive chairman at The Hoard in 2019.\n\nEric Knowles shared his journey into the world of antiques, linking it to a twist of fate and interest in history that led him from redundancy in Lancashire to a distinguished role at Bonhams Auction House in London.\n\nHe said: \"My career in antiques was largely a matter of fate and circumstance that saw my interest in history and architecture lead me out of redundancy with an engineering company up in my native Lancashire to a job in London as a porter at Bonhams auction house.\"\n\n\"I was to stay with the company for the next 32 years. Working for an auction house guarantees that no two days are ever the same.\"\n\nEric spent more than three decades with the company, enjoying a variety of experiences due to the nature of the auction world: \"I was to stay with the company for the next 32 years. Working for an auction house guarantees that no two days are ever the same.\"\n\nEric talked about his unexpected rise to television fame on BBC's Antiques Roadshow in the 1980s and how, despite his initial reservations, he stayed on for a surprising 27 years: \"When I started doing it I thought this could run for two to three years,\" he admitted. \"I never thought it would be for 27 years. It is a formula that seems to work. It is always the BBC's most popular factual programme.\"\n\nHis expertise on Antiques Roadshow propelled him onto other daytime television shows such as Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is and 20th Century Roadshow. Ultimately, he became a familiar face on Bargain Hunt, using his knowledge to assist the teams.\n\nEric also contemplated what might have been if not for his antique-rich path. He considered careers much removed from antiques, saying: \"Had I not followed a career in antiques I might have taken two different routes one being in the big outdoors and the Forestry Commission or the indoor studio working in Radio as a DJ.\"\n\nSon's tragic death\n\nEric's world was shattered when tragedy struck in 2015. His son Seb Knowles, just 26, passed away following a car crash after his vehicle collided with a lorry on the M40 in Buckinghamshire.\n\nSeb, who carved a niche for himself in the entertainment business as DJ Sparky B, supported Wycombe Wanderers and lit up numerous London venues with his performances.\n\nAhead of his untimely death, he had graced the decks alongside prominent music acts like Ultrabeat and The Artful Dodger. Seb also engaged listeners with his dynamic sets on Time FM and later brought his vibe to Wycombe Sound when he transferred there in 2013.\n\nThe loss saw an outpouring of grief, highlighting Seb's impressive talents and the impact he made in the music scene. One heartfelt tribute from the National Association of Disc Jockeys (NADJ) was shared on Facebook: \"All of us at NADJ would like to send our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Seb Knowles (DJ Sparky B) who tragically died earlier today.\"\n\n\"It's always a tragedy when someone is taken so young. He was a talented DJ who will be missed by all who knew him.\"\n\nEric Knowles' family and life off-camera\n\nEric Knowles has been a long-time spouse to Anita, managing the day-to-day affairs as company secretary for their shared enterprise, Eric Knowles Antiquarian Services Limited.\n\nExpertise in pottery and glass has led Eric, aged 71, down a path filled with accomplishmentsfrom launching The Pantiles Arcade gallery located in Royal Tunbridge Wells to authoring publications that delve into various antique realms, extending from Victorian treasures to Art Deco marvels and masterpieces by Rene Lalique.\n\nEric is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and an Ambassador for the Prince's Trust. He also works with several other charities including Headway, FABLE (For a better life with epilepsy), the New Mozart Orchestra and Wycombe Scanappeal.\n\nHe has another son named Oliver, but the family prefers to keep a low profile.\n\nWhen asked about his hobbies, he said he loves getting stuck in the garden. He said: \"My wife would argue that there is never such a thing as free time.\"\n\n\"But I do enjoy getting stuck into our garden. In truth, I am more of a vegetation controller than a gardener who is always in more need of a machete than a pair of secateurs.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

His journey to television fame began in the 1980s on Antiques Roadshow, leading to appearances on other beloved shows including 20th Century Roadshow and Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is.\n\nThe Lancashire-born presenter's foray into the antiques world was sparked by redundancy in the 1970s, which serendipitously paved the way for his esteemed TV career. Fans of the 71 year old may be curious about his path to stardom, his television endeavours, and his personal interests away from the camera.\n\nBorn on February 19, 1953, in Nelson, Lancashire, Eric attributes his career in antiques to \"largely a matter of fate and circumstance\". After losing his job in engineering in Lancashire, he took on a position as a porter at Bonhams Auction House's ceramics department in London in 1976, reports the Express.\n\nWithin five years, he climbed the ranks to head of department and eventually earned a full directorship. By 1992, he had set up a Bonhams auction house branch in Bristol. His career continued to flourish when he joined Dreweatts and Bloomsbury in 2013, and later took on the role of executive chairman of The Hoard in 2019.\n\nHe recounted: \"My career in antiques was largely a matter of fate and circumstance that saw my interest in history and architecture lead me out of redundancy with an engineering company up in my native Lancashire to a job in London as a porter at Bonhams auction house. I was to stay with the company for the next 32 years. Working for an auction house guarantees that no two days are ever the same.\"\n\nReflecting on his entrance into television, Eric first made waves as a ceramics expert on BBC's Antiques Roadshow in the 1980s, noting he had never anticipated the longevity or popularity it would bring: \"When I started doing it I thought this could run for two to three years,\" he said. \"I never thought it would be for 27 years. It is a formula that seems to work. It is always the BBC's most popular factual programme.\"\n\nHis charm and expertise on Antiques Roadshow led to opportunities on other daytime TV shows such as Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is and 20th Century Roadshow. Eric also stepped in as a guest presenter on Bargain Hunt, guiding the red and blue teams towards making a profit from their finds.\n\nConsidering an alternative path he might have taken, Eric mused: \"Had I not followed a career in antiques I might have taken two different routes one being in the big outdoors and the Forestry Commission or the indoor studio working in Radio as a DJ.\"\n\nEric's world was rocked by tragedy when his son Seb tragically passed away following a car accident in 2015. Seb Knowles, who was just 26, lost his life when his Mercedes was caught in a horrific collision with a lorry on the M40 in Buckinghamshire back in 2015.\n\nA DJ by profession, Seb was known for his love of Wycombe Wanderers and spun the decks across London as DJ Sparky B, boasting gigs where he supported big acts such as Ultrabeat and The Artful Dodger, and even had his own regular radio show on Time FM until he made a switch in 2013 to Wycombe Sound.\n\nFriends, fans and admirers poured out heartfelt tributes upon hearing the sad news of Seb's untimely death, pointing out his exceptional talent on the turntable. Among the numerous poignant tributes, one from the National Association of Disc Jockeys (NADJ) stood out, as they shared on Facebook: \"All of us at NADJ would like to send our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Seb Knowles (DJ Sparky B) who tragically died earlier today.\"\n\nTheir message continued with profound sadness: \"It's always a tragedy when someone is taken so young. He was a talented DJ who will be missed by all who knew him.\"\n\nAway from the TV spotlight, Eric Knowles has cultivated a rich personal life. Married to his long-standing partner Anita Knowles who plays a key role as the company secretary in their venture Eric Knowles Antiquarian Services Limited, Eric remains a prominent figure outside of his television career.\n\nAt the age of 71, Eric's expertise in ceramics and glass shines through in his gallery endeavour, The Pantiles Arcade, nestled in Royal Tunbridge Wells. Not confined to the screen, Eric has also made his mark as an author, taking readers on a journey through topics such as Victoriana, Royal trinkets, the flourish of Art Nouveau, the sleek style of Art Deco, and the works of Rene Lalique.\n\nEric is not only a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and an Ambassador for the Prince's Trust, but he also dedicates his time to supporting numerous charities, including Headway, FABLE (For a better life with epilepsy), the New Mozart Orchestra, and Wycombe Scanappeal.\n\nHe is a father to another son named Oliver, and they choose to keep their family life private.\n\nWhen asked about his hobbies, Eric quipped: \"My wife would argue that there is never such a thing as free time.

The ceramics expert rose to fame on Antiques Roadshow in the 1980s and has since appeared on many other popular programmes, such as 20th Century Roadshow and Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is.\n\nThe presenter and antiques expert from Lancashire landed his career in antiques after being made redundant in the 1970s and this tough job loss later led to a respected TV career.\n\nWith many fans, many will be wondering about the 71-year-old's rise to fame, his TV career and what he likes doing in his down time.\n\nBorn on February 19. 1953 in Nelson, Lancashire, Eric once quipped his career in antiques was \"largely a matter of fate and circumstance\". He was made redundant from his engineering job in Lancashire and took up a role as a porter in the ceramics department of Bonhams Auction House in London in 1976.\n\nJust five years later, he became head of department and was later offered a full directorship. By 1992, Eric had established a Bonhams auction house office in Bristol.\n\nHe later joined Dreweatts and Bloomsbury in 2013, before becoming the executive chairman of The Hoard in 2019.\n\nHe said: \"My career in antiques was largely a matter of fate and circumstance that saw my interest in history and architecture lead me out of redundancy with an engineering company up in my native Lancashire to a job in London as a porter at Bonhams auction house.\n\n\"I was to stay with the company for the next 32 years. Working for an auction house guarantees that no two days are ever the same.\"", "source": {"uri": "express.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "EXPRESS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_taylor@express.co.uk", "name": "Mike Taylor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiques_Roadshow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antiques Roadshow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antique", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antique"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Knowles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eric Knowles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic_art", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceramic art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_Your_Money_Where_Your_Mouth_Is_(TV_programme)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is (TV programme)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bargain_Hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bargain Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonhams", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bonhams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson,_Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nelson, Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nelson, Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_(beer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Porter (beer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomsbury"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bloomsbury"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/1200x630/5532774.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778809", "eventUri": "eng-9778809", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-19", "textStart": 652, "textEnd": 663}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

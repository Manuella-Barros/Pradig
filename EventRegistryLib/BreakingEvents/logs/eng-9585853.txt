Kirsten will prove to be vital for the Men in Green's preparation for the mega event.\n\nThe national side will play their first World Cup match on June 6 against the USA in Dallas and the most

As per the reports in the PTI, it is learned that Chairman Mohsin Naqvi is adamant about getting a key figure on board for the tournament.\n\nThe T20 World Cup 2024 will begin on 1st June and will end on 30th June. The tournament will be played in the United States of America and the Caribbean and entering into the tournament, Babar Azam-led side Pakistan Cricket Team will be one of the favorites for the title.\n\nViv Richards, who has served as mentor for Quetta Gladiators in the Pakistan Super League since 2016, is seen as a potential candidate because the Pakistan Cricket Board feels that with the Super 8 stage set to take place in the Caribbean, the batting legend's experience of those conditions could be vital for the team.\n\nA source close to Pakistan Cricket stated that although Viv Richards has some media commitments, the governing body is working out things with him and Pakistan players are also keen to work with batting great. Speaking about the same, he elaborated:\n\n\"Sir Viv Richards has some prior media commitments for the World Cup but things are being worked out as the Pakistani players have great respect and regard for him.\"\n\nIf the deal goes well then the presence of Viv Richards will be a massive boost for the team in the T20 World Cup 2024. Pakistan's team has been consistent in the last two World Cups. They reached the semi-final in 2021 and then played the final in 2022. At that time team had roped in Matthew Hayden as mentor of the team.\n\nPakistan will be captained by Babar Azam in the T20 World Cup 2024. The batter was reappointed as the skipper of the team after being removed as the leader of the side after the ICC World Cup 2023. He would be keen to make an impact and take his team to the title win. Earlier, they appointed Gary Kirsten as the head coach ahead of the T20 World Cup 2024\n\nThe reports also claimed that the Pakistan Cricket Board is keen to appoint Tony Hemmings as pitch curator. The reports claimed that Hammings has applied for the role and the governing body is keen to welcome him. A source confirmed about the said:\n\n\"He applied for the Chief Curator position with the PCB and is ready to come to Pakistan. The PCB Chairman has given priority to improving the behaviour of pitches in the country before the start of the next domestic season so Hemmings has been short-listed.\"\n\nTony Hemmings has served as an International Cricket Soil Advisor and Consultant for the Western Australia Cricket Association (WACA) in Perth and also as the Head Curator at the ICC Cricket Academy and the Dubai International Stadium.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viv_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viv Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hemmings", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Hemmings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta_Gladiators", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quetta Gladiators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babar_Azam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Babar Azam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Super_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Super League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WACA_Ground", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WACA Ground"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Kirsten", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Kirsten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Hayden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/RichardsPakistan.jpeg?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9585853", "eventUri": "eng-9585853", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 372, "textEnd": 380}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 397, "textEnd": 406}], "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

during T20 World Cup 2024?", "body": "LAHORE: With the T20 World Cup 2024 just around the corner, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is attempting to rope in legendary West Indian cricketer Sir Vivian Richards as the team mentor for the mega event.\n\nAs per the sources, negotiations are ongoing between the cricket body and Richards as the former aims to secure his services due to his vast experience and knowledge and the potential impact it might bring in light of the fact that the mega event is being held in West Indies and the United States.\n\nThe PCB's decision is also inspired by Richards' role in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) where he mentors the Quetta Gladiators franchise.\n\nHowever, the hurdle that PCB needs to overcome in this regard is the veteran cricketer's existing media commitments in the upcoming tournament set to commence on June 2.\n\nNevertheless, the board remains committed to securing the West Indies legend's services as it continues to explore solutions to address the scheduling issue.\n\nThe development comes as Pakistan's new white-ball head coach Gary Kirsten has already joined the national side in the United Kingdom ahead of the four-match T20I series against England set to kick off tomorrow and will prove to be vital for the Men in Green's preparation for the mega event.\n\nThe national side will play their first World Cup match on June 6 against the USA in Dallas and the most anticipated clash between Pakistan and India will take place on June 9 (Sunday) in New York.\n\nThe T20I World Cup 2024 will see a total of 20 qualifying teams, which have been divided into four groups of five, contesting for the coveted title.\n\nThe top two teams of every group will make their way to the Super Eight round.\n\nIn that stage, qualifying teams will once again be divided into two groups of four, from which the top two teams will make their way to the semi-final and then the winners will play the final.\n\nThe semi-finals of the event will be played on June 26 and 27 in Guyana and Trinidad, respectively, while the World Cup final will take place in Barbados on June 29.\n\nThe venues in West Indies include Barbados' Kensington Oval, Trinidad's Brian Lara Cricket Academy, Guyana's Providence Stadium, Antigua's Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, St Lucia's Darren Sammy Cricket Ground, and St Vincent's Arnos Vale Stadium.\n\nMeanwhile, in the US, three venues will host the games including New York's Eisenhower Park, Florida's Lauderhill, and Grand Prairie in Texas.", "source": {"uri": "geo.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "GEO TV"},

period, weighed down by tax effects and an impairment related to a real estate sale.\n\nThe company reported a net loss for continuing operations of 407 million reais (\u20ac74.6 million) in the quarter.\n\nGPA said the losses deepened on expenses related to a tax renegotiation programme it had joined, an impairment from the sale of its headquarters and lower tax gains.\n\nExcluding those effects, GPA's net loss for the quarter would have been 197 million reais (\u20ac36.1 million).\n\nOn the operational front, its gross revenue grew 8.2% to 4.87 billion reais (\u20ac890 million).\n\nCore earnings, or adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) jumped 41% to 372 million reais (\u20ac68.2 million), with the EBITDA margin increasing from 6.3% to 8.1% year-on-year.\n\nGPA has been selling assets during the last quarter to cut debt, while also restructuring its business, turning its focus to higher-income clients.\n\nIt also raised $142 million with a share offer in March.\n\nNet debt including credit card receivables ended the quarter at 1.6 billion reais (\u20ac290 million), falling from 3 billion (\u20ac550 million) a year earlier, while financial leverage dropped to 3 times from 9.8 times.\n\nCFO Rafael Russowsky told Reuters better debt figures also came in, apart from asset sales and better capital structure, after a \"very significant\" operational improvement.\n\n\"These figures ... bring us closer and closer to really ending this 'turnaround' phase in the company to live a new moment, looking at growth\", Russowsky said.\n\nHe did not give a target for financial leverage in the year-end, but said for a business such as GPA, he sees something close to 1 times to 1.5 times as \"reasonable\".", "source":

According to Magazine Luiza, overall sales rose by a \"high-single digit\" in April.\n\nIts core earnings, or adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), rose 53.5% to 687.8 million reais, against the analyst estimate of 700 million reais.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margins hit 7.4%, up 2.5 percentage points year-on-year to the highest in four years, according to the firm, partially helped by a pass-through during last year of a tax related to interstate purchases within Brazil.\n\nMagazine Luiza has focused on turning a profit over the past two years as interest rates in the country went up.\n\nBut now as the central bank has started a rate-cutting cycle, the firm has start to deliver more profitable results, and sees an opportunity to boost sales through investments in the customer experience, Bellissimo said.\n\nThe firm added that it has temporarily closed six stores of the 107 it owns in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, which has faced deadly floods in the past few days.

This marks a significant turnaround from the losses experienced in the same period last year.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the company attributed this recovery partly to the higher food inflation, which expanded its profits beyond expectations.

A notable performer within the group, the hybrid wholesale unit Atacadao, which constitutes nearly 70% of the group's activity, saw its sales grow by an impressive 6.6%. \"Recovery of food inflation to positive levels had a positive effect on our prices and volumes,\" commented CEO Stephane Maquaire during a press briefing.\n\nThe recent upward trends in food inflation have particularly benefitted sales to corporate customers, especially smaller grocery outlets, which previously curbed their purchases amid financial strains from dwindling margins.\n\nStrategic Adjustments and EBITDA Growth\n\nIn response to the declining sales in its retail segment, which dropped over 10% in the quarter, Maquarie revealed that Carrefour Brasil is exploring lower pricing strategies for some basic items to enhance performance.\n\nFurthermore, the conglomerate reported a 36.6% increase in its consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to 1.42 billion reais, slightly surpassing analyst forecasts of 1.33 billion reais. Adjusted EBITDA margins also improved, rising to 5.7% from 4.3% a year earlier.\n\nNavigating Natural Disasters\n\nThe CEO also disclosed the temporary closure of seven Rio Grande do Sul stores due to the devastating floods affecting Brazil's southernmost state.

According to Magazine Luiza, overall sales rose by a \"high-single digit\" in April.\n\nIts core earnings, or adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), rose 53.5% to 687.8 million reais, against the analyst estimate of 700 million reais.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margins hit 7.4%, up 2.5 percentage points year-on-year to the highest in four years, according to the firm, partially helped by a pass-through during last year of a tax related to interstate purchases within Brazil.\n\nMagazine Luiza has focused on turning a profit over the past two years as interest rates in the country went up.\n\nBut now as the central bank has started a rate-cutting cycle, the firm has start to deliver more profitable results, and sees an opportunity to boost sales through investments in the customer experience, Bellissimo said.\n\nThe firm added that it has temporarily closed six stores of the 107 it owns in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, which has faced deadly floods in the past few days.

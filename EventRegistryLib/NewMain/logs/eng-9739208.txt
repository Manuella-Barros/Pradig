I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband.'\n\nShe called for people to 'reunite' and said she is thinking of her fellow Americans.\n\n'This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence,' her statement continued.\n\n'The winds of change have arrived. For those of you who cry in support, I thank you. I commend those of you who have reached out beyond the political divide - thank you for remembering that every single politician is a man or a woman with a loving family.'\n\nThere was no sign of Barron Trump on Thursday, the last night of the Republican National Convention, when the party crowns Donald Trump as its nominee.\n\nThe former president's youngest son attended his first political rally in early July, the week before the assassination attempt on his father. There he stood up and waved to the crowd, garnering massive cheers his father's faithful.\n\nThe 18-year-old graduated from high school in May and is expected to attend college in the fall.\n\nHis graduation was the last time Donald and Melania Trump were seen in public together.\n\nEarlier this summer, Barron Trump declined Florida's offer to be a delegate to the Republican National Convention this summer.\n\nA week after the state announced the 18-year-old would represent it at Donald Trump's nomination, Melania Trump's office announced Barron had 'prior commitments.'\n\n'While Barron is honored to have been chosen as a delegate by the Florida Republican Party, he regretfully declines to participate due to prior commitments,' the Office of Melania Trump said.\n\nNo further details were given.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, Lara Trump, Eric Luke Trump, and Carolina Dorothy Trump watch Eric Trump address the convention\n\nAs Usha Chilukuri Vance, Ivanka Trump former first lady Melania Trump and Eric Trump watch, Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential candidate Sen.

Scott Applewhite / AP\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump is joined on stage by former first lady Melania Trump at the Republican National Convention Thursday, July 18, 2024, in Milwaukee.\n\nBy Jonathan J. Cooper, Associated Press\n\nThursday, July 18, 2024 | 10:46 p.m.\n\nMILWAUKEE -- Melania Trump and Ivanka Trump were at the Republican National Convention Thursday, making a rare appearance in support of former President Donald Trump's third bid for president.\n\nThe former first lady and the former president's eldest daughter have largely steered clear of the campaign trail this year, a contrast with Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns when both played a larger role. Neither gave speeches.\n\nMelania Trump's presence helps the Republican Party show widespread unity, a theme that emerged prominently after the attempt on Trump's life last weekend. A day after the attack, Melania issued a statement calling on Americans to \"ascend above hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence.\"\n\nCampaigns often use spouses and families to humanize a candidate, but with Melania Trump taking a backseat this year, that job fell to other speakers, who painted a sympathetic portrait of Trump by sharing anecdotes of warm interactions between him and their children. Trump's 17-year-old granddaughter, Kai Trump, called him \"just a normal grandfather.\"\n\nTrump's family, minus Melania, entered the arena after Trump signed paperwork formally accepting the GOP nomination. They went to the family box and stood throughout a boisterous speech by the wrestler Hulk Hogan.\n\nMelania entered later, smiling and waving to the crowd as she walked alone into the arena and up a flight of stairs to take her seat next to vice presidential nominee JD Vance. She wore a red skirt suit as Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 played.\n\n\"On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania,\" Trump said to extended applause. \"And Melania, thank you very much.\"\n\nHe said she \"did something really beautiful\" when she wrote her statement pleading for unity after the shooting.\n\nMelania Trump later joined Trump on stage, startling him as she walked up behind him after his 93-minute speech, then whispered in his ear. The rest of the Trump family joined and balloons fell from the ceiling, an iconic tradition of political conventions. Some of Trump's younger grandchildren, big smiles on their faces, batted balloons with their hands and feet.\n\nAs the family lingered on stage for 20 minutes, Melania Trump stood by Trump's side being quietly affectionate, touching her husband's arm at times and sometimes chatting with Vance and his wife, Usha Vance.\n\nTrump's two oldest sons, Donald Trump Jr., and Eric Trump, both spoke to delegates this week, as did their partners, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Lara Trump, respectively. Daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband, Michael Boulos, were at the convention but did not speak. The president's youngest child, 18-year-old Barron Trump, did not appear at the convention. He declined an invitation to be a Florida delegate.\n\nMelania Trump has skipped key moments of her husband's campaign, including rallies and primary-night victory parties. She did not join him in court as he faced trial over hush money payments to a porn star or for his remarks responding to the guilty verdict.\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, held senior roles on Donald Trump's White House staff but did not attend Trump's 2022 announcement that he planned another presidential campaign.\n\n\"While I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena,\" Ivanka Trump said in a statement at the time.\n\n--\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "jonathan_j_cooper@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Jonathan J.

The low-profile spouse is expected to be in the family box for her husband's remarks, officials said, but they would not otherwise comment on her activities, according to USA TODAY.\n\nBarron Trump was initially selected to serve as a Florida delegate at the RNC, but Melania Trump stated May 10 Barron would not be able to attend due to \"prior commitments.\"\n\nHere's what we know about the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and which Trump family members played a role.\n\nThe low-profile spouse is expected to be in the family box for her husband's remarks, officials said, but they would not otherwise comment on her activities.\n\nShe has no public schedule.\n\nMelania Trump has rarely been seen in public during her husband's 2024 campaign. She did issue a lengthy written statement after the July 13 assassination attempt: \"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,\" she wrote.\n\nBarron Trump, the sole child of Donald and the former president's third wife Melania Trump, made his Trump rally speech debut July 9, 2024, at the Trump family golf resort west of Miami.\n\nDonald Trump's youngest son did not speak at the event, and his older brothers, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, were there. Tiffany Trump, Ivanka Trump and Melania Trump did not appear to attend the Florida rally.\n\nBarron Trump was initially selected to serve as a Florida delegate at the 2024 Republican National Convention, but Melania Trump stated May 10 Barron would not be able to attend due to \"prior commitments.\"\n\nBarron Trump, who turned 18 on March 20, graduated from Oxbridge Academy near West Palm Beach, Florida, on May 17. At the Florida rally earlier this month, Donald Trump alluded to Barron's next step -- his choice of university to attend in fall 2024 -- but did not reveal where Barron would seek his college degree.\n\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the former president, appeared on stage Wednesday night at the RNC along with headliner Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Trump's running mate, who officially accepted the vice president nomination.\n\nTrump's son Eric Trump and daughter Tiffany Trump attended night two (Tuesday, July 16) of the Republican National Convention. Trump had appeared by video conference the night before and made his first in-person appearance at the RNC that night. Eric Trump's wife, Lara Trump, is a co-chair of the Republican National Committee.\n\nEric Trump is the Florida delegation chair and Monday he cast the votes for former president Donald Trump, putting him over the number needed to be the official nominee.\n\nTrump's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, are expected to appear on the last day of the convention, Thursday, July 18.\n\nDonald Trump's youngest daughter, Tiffany Trump, attended the Republican National Convention with her brother, Eric Trump, on Tuesday, July 16.\n\nDonald Trump's oldest granddaughter, Kai Trump, became the first of his grandchildren to talk about what it's like to have one of the most famous people in the world as a grandfather. Her Wednesday, July 17, speech at the Republican National Convention marked her first significant campaign role.\n\n\"I'm speaking today to share the side of my grandpa that people don't often see,\" she said. \"To me, he's just a normal grandpa. He gives us candy and soda when our parents aren't looking. He always wants to know how we're doing in school.\"\n\nKai Trump is the oldest of Donald Trump's 10 grandchildren and the oldest child of Donald Trump Jr.'s five children. She celebrated her 17th birthday on May 12.\n\nKai was born and mostly raised in New York, but now lives in South Florida with her mother, former model Vanessa Kay Trump, formerly Vanessa Kay Pergolizzi. Vanessa and Donald Jr. married in 2005 and had five children together before they eventually divorced, after 13 years of marriage, in 2018.\n\nDuring the week of Aug. 24, 2020, the Trump family supported then-president Donald Trump as he delivered his nomination acceptance speech from the White House.\n\nBecause of the coronavirus pandemic, however, most of the Republican National Convention speeches took place in a largely empty auditorium in Washington, D.C., or were pre-recorded from locations across the country.\n\nBarron Trump, former first lady Melania Trump, former president Donald Trump, Tiffany Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle, Lara Trump, Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and Michael Boulos (now Tiffany Trump's husband) posed for photos after Trump delivered his acceptance speech for the Republican Party nomination for re-election during the final day of the Republican National Convention at the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 27, 2020.\n\nContributing: Savannah Kuchar and David Jackson, USA TODAY, and C.

Here's which Trumps have appeared", "body": "Among the 116 seniors who received diplomas at Oxbridge Academy's Class of 2024 ceremony in West Palm Beach was Barron Trump, son of Donald and Melania Trump.\n\nIn 2020, the first family -- Melania Trump, Barron Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump and Tiffany Trump -- attended the Republican National Convention in unity to support former President Donald Trump.\n\nFor the 2024 RNC, as Trump prepares to formally accept the Republican nomination Thursday, July 18, most of the Trump family will have definitively attended, except for one.\n\nSince it started Monday, July 15, Donald Trump has made an appearance each night of the convention, seen with a bandage over his right ear where he was injured in an assassination attempt at his July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne notable absence on the RNC speaker lineup is former first lady Melania Trump. The low-profile spouse is expected to be in the family box for her husband's remarks, officials said, but they would not otherwise comment on her activities, according to USA TODAY.\n\nBarron Trump was initially selected to serve as a Florida delegate at the RNC, but Melania Trump stated May 10 Barron would not be able to attend due to \"prior commitments.\"\n\nHere's what we know about the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and which Trump family members played a role.\n\nWill Melania Trump attend 2024 Republican National Convention?\n\nThe low-profile spouse is expected to be in the family box for her husband's remarks, officials said, but they would not otherwise comment on her activities.\n\nShe has no public schedule.\n\nMelania Trump has rarely been seen in public during her husband's 2024 campaign. She did issue a lengthy written statement after the July 13 assassination attempt: \"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,\" she wrote.\n\nWill Barron Trump attend 2024 Republican National Convention?\n\nBarron Trump, the sole child of Donald and the former president's third wife Melania Trump, made his Trump rally speech debut July 9, 2024, at the Trump family golf resort west of Miami.\n\nDonald Trump's youngest son did not speak at the event, and his older brothers, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, were there. Tiffany Trump, Ivanka Trump and Melania Trump did not appear to attend the Florida rally.\n\nBarron Trump was initially selected to serve as a Florida delegate at the 2024 Republican National Convention, but Melania Trump stated May 10 Barron would not be able to attend due to \"prior commitments.\"\n\nBarron Trump, who turned 18 on March 20, graduated from Oxbridge Academy near West Palm Beach, Florida, on May 17. At the Florida rally earlier this month, Donald Trump alluded to Barron's next step -- his choice of university to attend in fall 2024 -- but did not reveal where Barron would seek his college degree.\n\nDid Donald Trump Jr. attend 2024 Republican National Convention?\n\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the former president, appeared on stage Wednesday night at the RNC along with headliner Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Trump's running mate, who officially accepted the vice president nomination.\n\nDid Eric Trump attend 2024 Republican National Convention?\n\nTrump's son Eric Trump and daughter Tiffany Trump attended night two (Tuesday, July 16) of the Republican National Convention. Trump had appeared by video conference the night before and made his first in-person appearance at the RNC that night. Eric Trump's wife, Lara Trump, is a co-chair of the Republican National Committee.\n\nEric Trump is the Florida delegation chair and Monday he cast the votes for former president Donald Trump, putting him over the number needed to be the official nominee.\n\nDid Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner attend 2024 Republican National Convention?\n\nTrump's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, are expected to appear on the last day of the convention, Thursday, July 18.\n\nDid Tiffany Trump attend 2024 Republican National Convention?\n\nDonald Trump's youngest daughter, Tiffany Trump, attended the Republican National Convention with her brother, Eric Trump, on Tuesday, July 16.\n\nWho is Kai Trump?\n\nDonald Trump's oldest granddaughter, Kai Trump, became the first of his grandchildren to talk about what it's like to have one of the most famous people in the world as a grandfather. Her Wednesday, July 17, speech at the Republican National Convention marked her first significant campaign role.\n\n\"I'm speaking today to share the side of my grandpa that people don't often see,\" she said. \"To me, he's just a normal grandpa. He gives us candy and soda when our parents aren't looking. He always wants to know how we're doing in school.\"\n\nKai Trump is the oldest of Donald Trump's 10 grandchildren and the oldest child of Donald Trump Jr.'s five children. She celebrated her 17th birthday on May 12.\n\nKai was born and mostly raised in New York, but now lives in South Florida with her mother, former model Vanessa Kay Trump, formerly Vanessa Kay Pergolizzi. Vanessa and Donald Jr. married in 2005 and had five children together before they eventually divorced, after 13 years of marriage, in 2018.\n\nMelania Trump, Barron Trump attended 2020 Republican National Convention\n\nDuring the week of Aug. 24, 2020, the Trump family supported then-president Donald Trump as he delivered his nomination acceptance speech from the White House.\n\nBecause of the coronavirus pandemic, however, most of the Republican National Convention speeches took place in a largely empty auditorium in Washington, D.C., or were pre-recorded from locations across the country.\n\nBarron Trump, former first lady Melania Trump, former president Donald Trump, Tiffany Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle, Lara Trump, Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and Michael Boulos (now Tiffany Trump's husband) posed for photos after Trump delivered his acceptance speech for the Republican Party nomination for re-election during the final day of the Republican National Convention at the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 27, 2020.\n\nMelania, Barron Trump attended 2020 RNC.

Neither gave speeches.\n\nMelania Trump's presence helps the Republican Party show widespread unity, a theme that emerged prominently after the attempt on Trump's life last weekend. A day after the attack, Melania issued a statement calling on Americans to \"ascend above hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence.\"\n\nCampaigns often use spouses and families to humanize a candidate, but with Melania Trump taking a backseat this year, that job fell to other speakers, who painted a sympathetic portrait of Trump by sharing anecdotes of warm interactions between him and their children. Trump's 17-year-old granddaughter, Kai Trump, called him \"just a normal grandfather.\"\n\nTrump's family, minus Melania, entered the arena after Trump signed paperwork formally accepting the GOP nomination. They went to the family box and stood throughout a boisterous speech by the wrestler Hulk Hogan.\n\nMelania entered later, smiling and waving to the crowd as she walked alone into the arena and up a flight of stairs to take her seat next to vice presidential nominee JD Vance. She wore a red skirt suit as Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 played.\n\n\"On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania,\" Trump said to extended applause. \"And Melania, thank you very much.\"\n\nHe said she \"did something really beautiful\" when she wrote her statement pleading for unity after the shooting.\n\nMelania Trump later joined Trump on stage, startling him as she walked up behind him after his 93-minute speech, then whispered in his ear. The rest of the Trump family joined and balloons fell from the ceiling, an iconic tradition of political conventions. Some of Trump's younger grandchildren, big smiles on their faces, batted balloons with their hands and feet.\n\nAs the family lingered on stage for 20 minutes, Melania Trump stood by Trump's side being quietly affectionate, touching her husband's arm at times and sometimes chatting with Vance and his wife, Usha Vance.\n\nTrump's two oldest sons, Donald Trump Jr., and Eric Trump, both spoke to delegates this week, as did their partners, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Lara Trump, respectively. Daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband, Michael Boulos, were at the convention but did not speak. The president's youngest child, 18-year-old Barron Trump, did not appear at the convention. He declined an invitation to be a Florida delegate.\n\nMelania Trump has skipped key moments of her husband's campaign, including rallies and primary-night victory parties.

She walked into the Trump family box to take a seat by J.D. Vance, her husband's vice presidential nominee.\n\nBut Donald Trump had already exited the box to prepare to address the delegates. Despite her distain for politics, Melania seemed happy to be at the convention, smiling and waving to the delegates.\n\nThe Trumps were together earlier in the evening, however, when Melania, wearing Dior, watched Donald sign the paperwork for him to become the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nShe then stayed behind the scenes until shortly before Donald was scheduled to speak. The former first lady did not join the rest of the Trump family in walking out into the convention hall.\n\nIvanka Trump, Don Jr., and Tiffany were all with their father in the main box in the convention hall. They listened and cheered with the crowd while Hulk Hogan and Eric Trump fired up the delegates.\n\nThe former president was surrounded by his children and grandchildren as he prepared to address the convention, which marks his formal acceptance of the nomination. But Melania, who has rarely appeared on the campaign trail, waited until the last moments before his remarks to join the family.\n\nShe did not address the delegates on Thursday night, despite being offered the chance to do so.\n\nShe did speak to delegates at the 2016 and 2020 conventions but, this election year, she has stayed in the shadows while her husband runs for a second term.\n\nThursday was also Ivanka Trump's first night at the convention and also marked a rare political appearance. The former first daughter is there in her 'personal capacity' to support her father, sources close to her said.\n\nShe has stayed away from politics since her father decided to run for a second term, despite previously being involved in his campaigns and his administration.\n\nHer brothers have stayed active. Both Don Jr. - who addressed the convention on Wednesday - and Eric have been surrogates on the campaign trail. Eric's wife Lara joined the Republican National Committee to help run the former president's re-election effort.\n\nThe family has gathered around its patriarch since an assassin attempted to kill him on July 13th.\n\nMelania Trump, who rarely makes public statements, spoke to the horror when she realized her and son Barron's life were on the brink of 'devastating change' after the hearing the news about her husband's assassination attempt.\n\nThe former first lady called the gunman a 'monster' and described the moment she watched the bullet strike her husband's ear at a Pennsylvania rally in front of thousands of his adoring fans.\n\n'A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,' Melania said in an emotional statement on X on Sunday morning.\n\n'When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change. I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband.'\n\nShe called for people to 'reunite' and said she is thinking of her fellow Americans.\n\n'This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence,' her statement continued.\n\n'The winds of change have arrived. For those of you who cry in support, I thank you. I commend those of you who have reached out beyond the political divide - thank you for remembering that every single politician is a man or a woman with a loving family.'\n\nThere was no sign of Barron Trump on Thursday, the last night of the Republican National Convention, when the party crowns Donald Trump as its nominee.\n\nThe former president's youngest son attended his first political rally in early July, the week before the assassination attempt on his father. There he stood up and waved to the crowd, garnering massive cheers his father's faithful.\n\nThe 18-year-old graduated from high school in May and is expected to attend college in the fall.\n\nHis graduation was the last time Donald and Melania Trump were seen in public together.\n\nEarlier this summer, Barron Trump declined Florida's offer to be a delegate to the Republican National Convention this summer.\n\nA week after the state announced the 18-year-old would represent it at Donald Trump's nomination, Melania Trump's office announced Barron had 'prior commitments.'\n\n'While Barron is honored to have been chosen as a delegate by the Florida Republican Party, he regretfully declines to participate due to prior commitments,' the Office of Melania Trump said.\n\nNo further details were given.\n\nMeanwhile, Melania Trump has appeared publicly with her husband for campaign events just three times: his campaign kickoff in November 2022 at their Mar-a-Lago home, in March when she accompanied her husband to vote in the Florida presidential primary, and in April when she appeared at his side at a high-dollar fundraiser in Palm Beach.\n\nIn March, as she walked into the polling place, Melania was asked then if she would join the former president on the campaign trail.\n\nHer response: 'Stay tuned.'\n\nMelania Trump notably skipped the first presidential debate in Atlanta. Trump walked off the stage alone while Joe Biden was accompanied by Jill Biden.\n\nBut she did host two fundraisers for Log Cabin Republicans, the largest conservative LGBTQ+ organization: one at Mar-a-Lago and one at the Trumps' Trump Tower home in New York.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

She was joined by Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.\n\nShe will not address the delegates, despite being offered the chance to do so.\n\nShe did speak to delegates at the 2016 and 2020 conventions but, this election year, she has stayed in the shadows while her husband runs for a second term.\n\nShe spoke of the horror when she realized her and son Barron's life were on the brink of 'devastating change' after the hearing the news about her husband.\n\nThe former first lady called the gunman a 'monster' and described the moment she watched the bullet strike her husband's ear at a Pennsylvania rally in front of thousands of his adoring fans.\n\nRead More Biden holes up with Jill in Delaware during COVID battle as campaign plans event next week\n\n'A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,' Melania said in an emotional statement on X on Sunday morning.\n\n'When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change. I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband.'\n\nShe called for people to 'reunite' and said she is thinking of her fellow Americans.\n\n'This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence,' her statement continued.\n\n'The winds of change have arrived. For those of you who cry in support, I thank you. I commend those of you who have reached out beyond the political divide - thank you for remembering that every single politician is a man or a woman with a loving family.'\n\nThere was no sign of Barron Trump.\n\nThe former president's youngest soon attended his first political rally in early July, the week before the assassination attempt on his father. There he stood up and waved to the crowd, garnering massive cheers his father's faithful.\n\nThe 18-year-old graduated from high school in May and is expected to attend college in the fall.\n\nHis graduation was the last time Donald and Melania Trump were seen in public together.\n\nEarlier this summer, Barron Trump declined Florida's offer to be a delegate to the Republican National Convention this summer.\n\nA week after the state announced the 18-year-old would represent it at Donald Trump's nomination, Melania Trump's office announced Barron had 'prior commitments.'\n\n'While Barron is honored to have been chosen as a delegate by the Florida Republican Party, he regretfully declines to participate due to prior commitments,' the Office of Melania Trump said.\n\nNo further details were given.\n\nAs Usha Chilukuri Vance, Ivanka Trump former first lady Melania Trump and Eric Trump watch, Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential candidate Sen.

Trump walked off the stage alone while Joe Biden was accompanied by Jill Biden.\n\nBut she did host two fundraisers for Log Cabin Republicans, the largest conservative LGBTQ+ organization: one at Mar-a-Lago and one at the Trumps' Trump Tower home in New York.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And then there were some Trumps -- like the Republican front-runner's eldest grandchild Kai Trump -- who made their national stage debut this week.\n\nHere's what to know about the Trump family members at the Republican National Convention.\n\nDonald Trump Jr., 46, was one of the last to speak Wednesday -- just before Usha Vance, the wife of vice-presidential pick J.D. Vance, and the vice-presidential candidate himself.\n\nTrump's eldest son is a frequent proxy for his father and serves as an executive vice president in the Trump Organization.\n\nHe spoke at length about the assassination attempt against his father at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania and praised Trump's reaction as a show of strength. \"I've never been prouder of my father than I was in that moment,\" he said.\n\nDonald Trump Jr.'s daughter, Kai Trump, 17, gave what her father described as her \"first speech\" Wednesday and emphasized what a supportive grandfather the elder Trump has been.\n\n\"A lot of people have put my grandpa through hell, and he's still standing,\" she said. \"Grandpa, you are such an inspiration, and I love you. The media makes my grandpa seem like a different person.\"\n\nAfter she spoke, her father told her, \"You crushed that,\" while someone in the crowd yelled \"Kai 2040!\"\n\nTrump's second-oldest son, Eric Trump, 40, is expected to speak at the convention Thursday night. He, like his brother, is an executive vice president in the Trump Organization, and he has been supporting his father during the campaign, speaking at state conventions and to the media about the assassination attempt and their family.\n\n\"There's no family I don't think in political history that's remained closer than our family,\" Eric Trump said Wednesday in a television interview. \"And we're a family that's cohesive. We are a family that absolutely supports him, that absolutely loves him to death, and I'm honored to stand on that stage.\"\n\nLara Trump, 41, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee and Eric Trump's wife, was the first Trump family member to speak on the main stage of the convention Tuesday night.\n\nLara Trump spoke about her father-in-law's role as a family man who \"has sacrificed for his country,\" and she urged voters not to believe \"some outrageous narrative about the terrible things that Donald Trump will do if he becomes president.\"\n\nNotably, she gave a shout-out to \"gay supporters\" in her prime-time speech. The Republican Party just removed its platform's opposition to same-sex marriage.\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle, 55, Donald Trump Jr.'s fianc\u00e9e, was one of several speakers on Wednesday to say that Trump survived his attempted assassination due to divine intervention. Guilfoyle, who is also an adviser to Trump, began her speech by saying she knows that \"God has put an armor of protection over Donald Trump.\"\n\nGuilfoyle railed against President Biden and Democrats, arguing that Trump supporters are \"made to feel like enemies in our own country.\"\n\nNotable members of the Trump family have not spoken or been spotted at the convention -- yet. Trump's wife, Melania Trump, 54, and Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, 42, are not on the list of announced headliners and keynote speakers but are expected to make an appearance.\n\n\"They're coming in and in full force and effect, so they'll certainly be here,\" Eric Trump said about Melania and Ivanka Trump in an interview with CBS. \"Ivanka's been an incredible supporter of my father ... and obviously Melania, as well.\"\n\nIvanka Trump, who served as a senior adviser to her father during his presidency, said in 2022 that she would support her father outside the political arena moving forward because she wanted to preserve her family's privacy. And Melania Trump has increasingly retreated from the public eye since the end of Trump's presidency, though in a statement Sunday about the shooting she praised her husband as a \"generous and caring man.\"\n\nDonald and Melania Trump's son, Barron Trump, 18, is also not scheduled to speak.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "annabelle_timsit@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Annabelle Timsit", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "maham_javaid@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Maham Javaid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The former first lady was not mentioned on the list of speakers at the RNC for Thursday, but later made her official entrance to the convention floor to lilting classical music.\n\nWearing a red suit, Melania smiled and waved to supporters, before joining her husband and Vance in the box as the appplause continued.\n\nIn his acceptance speech - the longest in RNC history - Trump directed crowds towards Melania, saying: \"On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania.\" To cheers, he continued: \"Melania, thank you very much. You also did something really beautiful, a letter to America, calling for national unity.\"\n\nAs he concluded his remarks after almost two hours, the former first lady returned to the stage to join her husband offering him a small kiss on the cheek. The pair held hands as they were joined by members of the Trump family as thousands of red, white and blue balloons fell.\n\nIn his speech former president thanked his entire family: \"Don, Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared, Eric and Lara, Tiffany and Michael, Barron, we love our Barron.\" Barron did not appear to be in the box alongside his other family members, nor on the stage later.\n\nThe 18-year-old recently made his entrance onto the political scene at a rally at Trump's Doral golf resort in Miami, Florida. Echoing his father's showmanship the teenager waved to crowds and pumped his fists, prompting Trump to joke that he was \"more popular\" than his other sons.\n\nBack in Milwaukee, Trump paid tribute to his 10 \"wonderful\" grandchildren. \"You saw a few of them up there on my lap before,\" he said.\n\nSpeculation about Melania's whereabouts have swirled for days as other members of the Trump familywere pictured on the convention floor, and in the box with the former president\n\nThe former president was also pictured dancing alongside his young grandchildren Spencer and Chloe, the children of Don Jr. He also spent time with Luke and Carolina - the children of Lara and Eric Trump.\n\nMelania's entrance in Milwaukee marks her first major political appearance with Trump since he announced his 2024 campaign almost two years ago.\n\nSources told Politico that the former first lady was deeply shaken by the shocking assassination attempt.\n\nShortly following the incident on Saturday during a campaign rally in Butler Pennsylvania, she released a statement in which she described the would-be assassin as a \"monster.\"\n\n\"When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change. I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband,\" Melania wrote.\n\n\"To the families of the innocent victims who are now suffering from this heinous act, I humbly offer my sincerest sympathy. Your need to summon your inner strength for such a terrible reason saddens me.\n\n\"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration. The core facets of my husband's life -- his human side -- were buried below the political machine. Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times.\"\n\nMelania has not remained completely out of politics, having headlined two fundraisers for the Log Cabin Republicans, a pro-LGBTQ+ rights Republican organization in spring.\n\nBoth were held at Trump properties -- Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower -- and were closed to the press. However, Melania has not held any public campaign events or accompanied Trump at events out on the trail beyond a few private fundraisers and voting in Florida's primary.\n\nDonald Jr, his fiance\u00e9 Kimberly Guilfoyle, and now Eric Trump have all made speeches to supporters of the former president in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Source: Reuters.\n\nMelania Trump, the elusive wife of Donald Trump, made a rare appearance at the Republican National Convention to support her husband in his third bid for the White House, but unlike in 2016 and 2020, this time she was not scheduled to deliver a speech.\n\nIt is tradition at party conventions for the candidates' spouses to give a speech and tell heavily-scripted anecdotes about family life. Trump's running mate and Republican Vice Presidential nominee JD Vance's wife Usha Chilukuri Vance also gave a speech on Wednesday.\n\nSoon after Trump's lengthy acceptance speech on the last day of RNC in Milwaukee ended, Melania, 54, walked to the podium alone as classical music played in the background. She was seen sporting a Republican red dress, appearing glamorous.\n\nOnce on stage, Melania was greeted with applause and balloons rained down on the crowd gathered to attend the RNC.\n\nA hug & kiss\n\nTrump greeted Melania with a hug and the couple shared a kiss on the cheek.\n\nHe then grabbed Melania's hand and walked across the stage with other members of his family including Ivanka Trump (Donald Trump's daughter), her husband Jared Kushner, joining them.\n\nMelania has been keeping a low profile since her husband's 2024 White House bid. She had not been spotted in Milwaukee since the convention kicked off on Monday.\n\nIn his speech on the final day of RNC 2024, Trump took a moment to express his appreciation for Melania, saying: \"I am deeply honoured to be joined by my amazing wife Melania.\"\n\nTrump said: \"Melania, thank you very much you also did something really beautiful, a letter to America for national Unity and it really took the Republican party by surprise, it was beautiful.\"\n\nLast week, after an assassination attempt on Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, Melania had issued a statement calling for unity.\n\n\"This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence. We all want a world where respect is paramount, family is first, and love transcends. We can realise this world again. Each of us must demand to get it back. We must insist that respect fills the cornerstone of our relationships again,\" she said in a statement.\n\nDonald Trump said that Meliana's letter \"captivated so many\".\n\nEver since Donald Trump was first elected in 2016, Melania has broken all the rules of normal American presidential politics.\n\nIn the White House during Trump's first term, she was a reclusive figure compared to other first ladies, focusing on a narrow set of interests.

'And Melania, thank you very much.'\n\nHe said she 'did something really beautiful' when she wrote her statement pleading for unity after the shooting.\n\nA day after the attack, Melania issued a statement calling on Americans to 'ascend above hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence'.\n\nMelania Trump later joined Trump on stage, startling him as she walked up behind him after his 93-minute speech, then whispered in his ear.\n\nThe rest of the Trump family joined and balloons fell from the ceiling, an iconic tradition of political conventions.\n\nSome of Trump's younger grandchildren, big smiles on their faces, batted balloons with their hands and feet.\n\nAs the family lingered on stage for 20 minutes, Melania Trump stood by Trump's side being quietly affectionate, touching her husband's arm at times and sometimes chatting with Vance and his wife, Usha Vance.\n\nTrump's two oldest sons, Donald Trump Jr, and Eric Trump, both spoke to delegates this week, as did their partners, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Lara Trump, respectively.\n\nDaughter Tiffany Trump and her husband, Michael Boulos, were at the convention but did not speak.\n\nThe president's youngest child, 18-year-old Barron Trump, did not appear at the convention. He declined an invitation to be a Florida delegate.\n\nMelania Trump has skipped key moments of her husband's campaign, including rallies and primary-night victory parties.\n\nShe did not join him in court as he faced trial over hush money payments to a porn star or for his remarks responding to the guilty verdict.\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, held senior roles on Donald Trump's White House staff but did not attend Trump's 2022 announcement that he planned another presidential campaign.\n\n'While I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena,' Ivanka Trump said in a statement at the time.", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_corbishley@metro.co.uk", "name": "Sam Corbishley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

The media makes my grandfather look like a different person.\"\n\nAfter she spoke, her father told her: You crushed that, while someone in the crowd shouted Kai 2040!\n\nKai Trump, the eldest granddaughter of former President Donald Trump, explained to the crowd at the RNC what Trump was like as a grandfather on July 17. (Video: The Washington Post, Photo: Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nEric Trump\n\nTrump's second-eldest son, Eric Trump, 40, is expected to speak at the convention Thursday night. Like his brother, he is an executive vice president of the Trump Organization and has supported his father during the campaign, speaking at state conventions and in the media about the assassination attempt and their family.\n\n\"I don't think there's a family in political history that's stayed as close as ours,\" Eric Trump said Wednesday in a televised interview. \"And we're a tight-knit family. We're a family that absolutely supports him, absolutely loves him to death, and I'm honored to stand on this stage.\"\n\nLara Trump\n\nLara Trump, 41, co-chair of the Republican National Committee and wife of Eric Trump, was the first member of the Trump family to speak on the convention's main stage Tuesday night.\n\nRNC co-chair Lara Trump recalls the assassination attempt on her father-in-law, former President Donald Trump, during her July 15 speech in Milwaukee. (Video: TWP)\n\nLara Trump spoke about her father-in-law's role as a family man who sacrificed for his country, and she urged voters not to believe some of the outrageous stories about the terrible things Donald Trump will do if he becomes president.\n\nShe notably praised supporters of homosexuality during her prime-time speech. The Republican Party has just removed its opposition to same-sex marriage from its platform.\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle, 55, Donald Trump Jr.'s fianc\u00e9e, was one of several people to claim Wednesday that Trump survived his assassination attempt thanks to divine intervention. Guilfoyle, who is also a Trump adviser, began her speech by saying she knew God had placed protective armor on Donald Trump.\n\nGuilfoyle lashed out at President Biden and Democrats, saying Trump supporters feel like enemies in our own country.\n\nWhere are Melania Trump and Ivanka Trump?\n\nNotable members of the Trump family have yet to speak or be seen at the convention. Trump's wife, Melania Trump, 54, and Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, 42, are not on the list of announced headliners and keynote speakers, but are expected to make an appearance.\n\n\"They're coming in strong and in force, so they'll definitely be there,\" Eric Trump said of Melania and Ivanka Trump in an interview with CBS. Ivanka has been an incredible supporter of my dad and obviously Melania as well.\n\nIvanka Trump, who served as a senior adviser to her father during his presidency, said in 2022 that she would support her father outside the political arena in the future because she wanted to preserve her family's privacy. And Melania Trump has increasingly withdrawn from the public eye since the end of Trump's presidency, though in a statement Sunday about the shooting, she praised her husband as a generous and caring man.\n\nDonald and Melania Trump's son, Barron Trump, 18, is also not expected to speak.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

She was entirely devoted to her husband, daughters, grandson, and son-in-law. We will miss her beyond measure and continue to honor and love her legacy.\n\nMelania missed most of the Christmas and New Year celebrations at Mar-a-Lago to care for her ailing mother prior to her death.\n\nFormer First Lady Melania Trump 's mother Amalija Knavs, 78, has died after being hospitalized in Miami, Florida, over the holidays.

The jurors know that this is the former president.'\n\nIn the aftermath of Trump's guilty verdict, Daniels - who alleged she had an affair with the billionaire just a year after he married Melania - said his wife 'needs to leave him' because 'it's been proven he is abusive' and he 'is now a criminal'.\n\nTrump himself admitted in an interview on Fox & Friends that his trial was 'very hard' on Melania.\n\nBalloons fall after Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump officially accepted the Republican presidential nomination\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump, left, stands on stage with Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and Republican vice presidential candidate Sen.

I think it really shook her.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiserv_Forum",

Credit: President Duane The Owner of White House, CC BY 3.0 , via Wikimedia Commons\n\nIt has been claimed that Melania Trump, who served as the first lady of the United States, has \"no interest\" in campaigning for her husband at the Republican National Convention.\n\nMany who criticize former President Donald Trump on social media did not notice that several famous individuals were not present during the first few nights of the convention. Above all others, the question is, \"Where is Melania?\"\n\nIn the end, Melania Trump appeared on the convention's final day; however, according to Kaitlan Collins of CNN, she declined to speak out in support of former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I was told by sources they tried really hard to get her to give a speech tonight. They personally -- several people -- personally appealed to her and she had no interest in doing so,\" Collins reported, as per RawStory.\n\n\"Of course a lot has changed since 2016. Donald Trump was convicted in New York in the hush money case, something that became a real point of division between he and the first lady when that story broke when they were in the White House. And so it is notable to see her coming out as Melania Trump is known for doing in her own style, in her own way, coming out by herself to sit in this box,\" the CNN reporter went on.\n\nThe internet mocked Donald Trump over Melania's decision, saying, \"By the looks of it, she has no interest even being there.\" \"A smart choice on her part, to be honest,\" wrote @AreMond2 on Thursday.\n\nOne of the most vocal supporters of his father is Trump's eldest son, who is 46 years old and serves as executive vice president at the Trump Organization, which is owned by the Trump business family. JD Vance, the contender for vice president, was scheduled to speak on Wednesday night, but Trump Jr. spoke first. Vance is a friend of Trump Jr., and it has been stated that Trump Jr. campaigned for Vance to be chosen as the running mate.\n\nDuring his statement, Trump Jr. paid respect to Corey Comperatore, who was killed in a gunshot that occurred at a Trump rally on Saturday. He praised his father for having \"the heart of a lion\" and praised his father for his strength.\n\nAdditionally, Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former host on Fox News, who is now engaged to Donald Trump Jr., gave a speech in Milwaukee on Wednesday evening.\n\nWith her father, Trump Jr., introducing her, the granddaughter of the former president, who is now 17 years old, spoke at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night.\n\n\"To me, he's just a normal grandpa. To me, he gives us candy and soda when our parents aren't looking,\" she told the audience of Trump. \"He always wants to know how we're doing in school.\"\n\nShe also referred to her grandfather as a \"inspiration\" as she concluded her remarks.\n\nThere is only one of the previous president's children that works directly for him in the White House, and that is Ivanka Trump, the one and only daughter of the former president. Together with her husband, Jared Kushner, she functioned as an official adviser for the administration.\n\nAs was the case with Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump was not included on the roster of speakers; however, she did make an appearance in the arena on Thursday when the former president addressed the audience. Ivanka Trump, who is 42 years old, also spoke at the Republican conventions in 2016 and 2020.\n\nIt is not unexpected that Ivanka Trump has been absent from the public eye because she has been making it clear for many years that she intends to retire from politics. She remarked, \"I love my father very much,\" in a statement that was released in 2022, just a few moments after her father revealed that he would be running for the White House for the third time. \"This time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family.\"\n\nEric Trump, like his father Donald Trump Jr., is an executive vice president at the Trump Organization, which is owned by the Trump family. He has also taken on a job that involves pushing for his father's political agenda in front of the public.\n\nHe is scheduled to speak at the conference on Thursday between the hours of 8 and 9 p.m. Central Time (CT). Eric, who is forty years old, is included on the official speakers' list for Milwaukee.\n\nIn addition to supporting their father, Eric Trump, who was standing next to Tiffany Trump and Donald Trump Jr., also spoke on behalf of Florida's representatives.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the keynote presentation was delivered by Lara Trump, who is married to Eric Trump and serves as the handpicked co-chair of the Republican National Committee endorsed by the Republican nominee.\n\nWhile her father was in office and throughout her father's two prior campaigns, Tiffany Trump, who is now 30 years old, avoided politics as much as possible. Despite the fact that she spoke at the conventions in 2020 and 2016, she is not included on the official speakers' list for this year's event.\n\nWhile she was there on the floor with her two older brothers during the roll call nomination of their father, she is attending the Republican convention in 2024 as a delegate from the state of Florida.\n\nBarron Trump, the youngest child of Donald Trump, was initially chosen by the Florida Republican Party to serve as an official delegate in Milwaukee. This would have allowed him to enter the political arena alongside his siblings and other members of the Trump family. The young man, who is only 18 years old, has withdrawn his name from consideration and is not included on the list of speakers.\n\nBeginning at the beginning of this month, Barron made his debut at one of his father's campaign rallies. It is not apparent whether he will decide to take on a more public role.\n\nDuring the rally in Florida, his father stated, \"He is now going to college, and he got into every college he wanted to.\" \"He made his choice, and he is a very good guy.\"\n\n\"He might be more popular than Don and Eric... we gotta talk about this,\" his father joked after the audience gave him a standing ovation on his performance.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States",

COOPER - Associated Press\n\nMelania Trump and Ivanka Trump were at the Republican National Convention Thursday, making a rare appearance in support of former President Donald Trump's third bid for president.\n\nThe former first lady and the former president's eldest daughter have largely steered clear of the campaign trail this year, a contrast with Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns when both played a larger role. Neither gave speeches.\n\nMelania Trump's presence helps the Republican Party show widespread unity, a theme that emerged prominently after the attempt on Trump's life last weekend. A day after the attack, Melania issued a statement calling on Americans to \"ascend above hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Trump's 17-year-old granddaughter, Kai Trump, called him \"just a normal grandfather.\"\n\nTrump's family, minus Melania, entered the arena after Trump signed paperwork formally accepting the GOP nomination. They went to the family box and stood throughout a boisterous speech by the wrestler Hulk Hogan.\n\nMelania entered later, smiling and waving to the crowd as she walked alone into the arena and up a flight of stairs to take her seat next to vice presidential nominee JD Vance. She wore a red skirt suit as Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 played.\n\n\"On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania,\" Trump said to extended applause. \"And Melania, thank you very much.\"\n\nHe said she \"did something really beautiful\" when she wrote her statement pleading for unity after the shooting.\n\nMelania Trump later joined Trump on stage, startling him as she walked up behind him after his 93-minute speech, then whispered in his ear. The rest of the Trump family joined and balloons fell from the ceiling, an iconic tradition of political conventions. Some of Trump's younger grandchildren, big smiles on their faces, batted balloons with their hands and feet.\n\nAs the family lingered on stage for 20 minutes, Melania Trump stood by Trump's side being quietly affectionate, touching her husband's arm at times and sometimes chatting with Vance and his wife, Usha Vance.\n\nTrump's two oldest sons, Donald Trump Jr., and Eric Trump, both spoke to delegates this week, as did their partners, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Lara Trump, respectively. Daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband, Michael Boulos, were at the convention but did not speak. The president's youngest child, 18-year-old Barron Trump, did not appear at the convention. He declined an invitation to be a Florida delegate.\n\nMelania Trump has skipped key moments of her husband's campaign, including rallies and primary-night victory parties. She did not join him in court as he faced trial over hush money payments to a porn star or for his remarks responding to the guilty verdict.\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, held senior roles on Donald Trump's White House staff but did not attend Trump's 2022 announcement that he planned another presidential campaign.\n\n\"While I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena,\" Ivanka Trump said in a statement at the time.\n\n--\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He was originally selected as a convention delegate from Florida but Melania's office later announced Barron would not serve as he had a 'prior commitment.'\n\nHis absence was notable, particularly after he attended one of his father's campaign rallies earlier this month, where he stood and waved to the crowd.\n\nMelania has been fiercely protective of her only son throughout her husband's political career.\n\nBut Don Jr.'s and Eric's children were present. Kai Trump, 17, became the breakout star of the convention after she addressed the convention on Wednesday night, paying a sweet tribute to her grandfather.\n\nOn Thursday, it was the turn of Eric's daughter Carolina, four, as she stole the show when she sat on Trump's lap while Eric addressed the delegates.\n\nAt one point Carolina had her thumb in her mouth as her father spoke. Her older brother Eric Luke, 6, joined in on cheering on their dad as he sat on mom Lara's lap.\n\nDonald Trump, meanwhile, basked in the adoration of the delegates after he wrapped up his one hour and 32 minute speech.\n\nHe started off with a dramatic retelling of the assassination attempt on his life.\n\n'If I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassin's bullet would have perfectly hit its mark,' he said.\n\n'And I would not be here tonight. We would not be together.'\n\nThe nominee then rambled, going off the teleprompter, to slam Nancy Pelosi and name-check rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe delegates in the hall appeared restless with many taking their seats and taking out their phones. A few fell asleep.\n\nTrump failed to bring up abortion, an issue that has bedeviled Republicans ever since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federally guaranteed right to abortion two years ago.\n\nNor did he mention the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in which Trump supporters tried to stop the certification of his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump has long referred to the people jailed for the riot as 'hostages.'\n\nThey rallied for the grand finale however, roaring their approval as the Trump family took the stage to wave as balloons rained down around them.\n\nSince the assassination attempt on him on July 13th, Trump has had his family at his side.\n\nMost of them were on hand Thursday night to see him crowned as the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nHis children walked onto the convention floor with him.\n\nLater, Melania Trump, in a bright red skirt suit by Dior, made a dramatic entrance, walking into the arena to cheers and the music from Beethoven's symphony no. 9.\n\nShe was introduced to the roaring crowd as the future first lady.\n\nThe newly-anointed Republican nominee for president and his wife share a tender moment on stage after his marathon speech\n\nTrump appeared to be shocked when Melania came on stage at the end of his speech\n\nMelania smiles as the Donald leans in to give her a kiss while placing his hand on the lectern\n\nDonald Trump is joined on stage by his wife Melania, Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance, Usha Chilukuri Vance, Donald Trump Jr., Kai Trump, Donald Trump III, and Spencer Trump\n\nDonald Trump and his wife Melania Trump are joined by the rest of the Trump family and Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance and his wife Usha Vance\n\nMelania Trump joins Donald Trump on stage after his remarks\n\nTrump and Melania and running mate J.D. Vance and his wife Usha smile at the crowd after his speech\n\nOne of Trump's grandsons plays with the balloons at the conclusion of the Republican National Convention\n\nThe family affair was notable by the absence of Barron Trump\n\nMelania only joined the convention on its last night, taking her seat in the Trump family box shortly before Donald began his remarks.\n\nIvanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner also only attended on Thursday night, marking their first appearances in the campaign having stepped back from their key roles in the the former Apprentice host's inner political circle.\n\nIvanka has said that while she supports her father, she will not be campaigning for him.\n\nThe couple joined Don Jr. and Tiffany in the family box to sit with their father while Eric Trump addressed the crowd.\n\nBoth Don Jr. - who addressed the convention on Wednesday - and Eric have been surrogates on the campaign trail. Eric's wife Lara joined the leadership of Republican National Committee to help run the former president's re-election effort.\n\nThe former president was surrounded by his children and grandchildren as he prepared to address the delegates.\n\nHis family - except for Barron - was on hand while he spoke.\n\nMelania sat quietly during his speech, listening as he described the assassination attempt that nearly took his life. She smiled when he made little jokes but stared at her husband intently as he recounted the horrific event.\n\nDonald paid tribute to her during his remarks, calling her 'my amazing wife Melania.' She stood and waved as the crowd gave her a standing ovation.\n\n'Melania thank you very much. You also did something very beautiful. A letter to America calling for national unity,' he said.\n\nHe also thanked the rest of his family.\n\nDonald Trump's running mate J.D. Vance applauds and Melania smiles just as she arrives to take her seat\n\nTrump pumps his fist with his 17-year-old granddaughter Kai in the background\n\nThe Trump family, including some of his eleven grandchildren' swarm the stage to greet the cheering Milwaukee crowd\n\nThe traditional balloon dropped ended the convention\n\nDonald Trump after his acceptance speech\n\nThe delegates rose to their feet and cheered\n\nMelania, who rarely makes public statements, spoke to the horror when she realized her and son Barron's life were on the brink of 'devastating change' after the hearing the news about her husband's assassination attempt.\n\nThe former first lady called the gunman a 'monster' and described the moment she watched the bullet strike her husband's ear at a Pennsylvania rally in front of thousands of his adoring fans.\n\n'A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,' Melania said in an emotional statement on X on Sunday morning.\n\n'When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change. I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband.'\n\nShe called for people to 'reunite' and said she is thinking of her fellow Americans.\n\n'This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence,' her statement continued.\n\n'The winds of change have arrived. For those of you who cry in support, I thank you. I commend those of you who have reached out beyond the political divide - thank you for remembering that every single politician is a man or a woman with a loving family.'\n\nDonald Trump surrounded by his wife and children\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, Lara Trump, Eric Luke Trump, and Carolina Dorothy Trump watch Eric Trump address the convention\n\nAs Usha Chilukuri Vance, Ivanka Trump former first lady Melania Trump and Eric Trump watch, Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, sign paperwork to officially accept the nomination\n\nJared Kushner, former White House senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, former White House senior adviser, Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos, attend the final day of the Republican National Convention\n\nMelania Trump makes her dramatic entrance into the convention\n\nProfessional wrestling icon Hulk Hogan wowed the crowd with a display of physical strength\n\nTrump barely mentioned Biden, often referring only to the 'current administration.'\n\n'It was Donald Trump who destroyed our economy, ripped away rights, and failed middle class families,' said Jen O'Malley Dillon, the Biden campaign chair, in a statement after the speech.\n\n'Now he pursues the presidency with an even more extreme vision for where he wants to take this country.'\n\nTrump's appearance came as Biden, the 81-year-old Democratic incumbent, clings to his party's presumptive nomination in the face of unrelenting pressure from key congressional allies, donors and even former President Barack Obama, who fear he may be unable to win reelection after his disastrous debate.\n\nHours before the balloons were scheduled to rain down on Trump and his family inside the convention hall, Biden deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks appeared nearby in Milwaukee and insisted over and over that Biden would not step aside.\n\n'I do not want to be rude, but I don't know how many more times I can answer that,' Fulks told reporters. 'There are no plans being made to replace Biden on the ballot.'\n\nThursday's RNC program seemed designed to project strength and masculinity in an implicit rebuke of Biden.\n\nUltimate Fighting Championship President Dana White called Trump 'a real American bad ass.' Kid Rock performed a song with the chorus, 'Fight, fight!,' echoing the word Trump mouthed on stage in Pennsylvania as Secret Service agents surrounded him.\n\nAnd wrestling icon Hulk Hogan, marking his first appearance for Trump, he was not present during the 2016 campaign as he was in a period of exile after a video leaked of him using the N-word repeatedly in reference to a man who was dating his daughter, described the former president as 'an American hero.'\n\nAfter the convention, Trump heads to Detroit for a campaign rally on Saturday.\n\nIvanka Trump has said she supports her father but won't formally campaign for him.\n\nIt is unclear when or if Melania Trump will appear on the campaign trail.\n\nWhat Trump said about the July 13 assassination attempt\n\nTrump spoke at length about the assassination attempt on July 13\n\n'So many people have asked me what happened, and therefore, I'll tell you what happened, and you'll never hear it from me a second time, because it's too painful to tell.\n\nIt was a warm, beautiful day in the early evening in Butler Township in the great commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Music was loudly playing, and the campaign was doing well.\n\nI went to the stage, and the crowd was cheering wildly. I began speaking very happily because I was discussing the great job my administration did on immigration at the southern border.\n\nBehind me and to the right was a large screen that was displaying a chart of border crossings under my leadership.\n\nThe numbers were amazing. In order to see the chart, I started to turn to my right, and was ready to begin a further turn, which I'm lucky I didn't, when I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me, really hard, on my right ear.\n\nI said to myself, \"Wow, what was that -- it can only be a bullet,\" -- and moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down, and my hand was covered with blood.\n\nI immediately knew it was very serious, that we were under attack, and in one movement, proceeded to drop to the ground.\n\nBullets continued to fly as very brave Secret Service agents rushed to the stage and pounced on top of me for protection.\n\nThere was blood pouring everywhere, and yet, in a certain way I felt very safe, because I had God on my side.\n\nThe amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had NOT moved my head at the very last instant, the assassin's bullet would have perfectly hit its mark, and I would not be with you tonight.\n\nThe most incredible aspect of what took place on that terrible evening in the fading sun was seen later. In almost all cases, and when even a single bullet is fired -- and we had many -- crowds run for the exits or stampede, but not in this case.\n\nThis massive crowd of tens of thousands of people stood by and didn't move an inch. In fact, many of them bravely, but automatically, stood up looking for where the sniper would be, and then began pointing at him.\n\nNobody ran, and by not stampeding, many lives were saved. But that isn't the reason they didn't move -- the reason is that they knew I was in serious trouble, they saw all of the blood, and thought I was dead, and they just didn't want to leave me, and you can see that love written all over their faces.\n\nBullets were flying over us, yet I felt serene -- but now the Secret Service agents were putting themselves in peril. And then it all stopped. Our Secret Service sniper, from a much greater distance, and with only one bullet, took the assassin out.\n\nI am not supposed to be here tonight. I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God. Many people say it was a providential moment.\n\nWhen I rose, surrounded by Secret Service, the crowd was confused because they thought I was dead, and there was great sorrow on their faces until I raised my right arm, looked at the thousands of people that were breathlessly waiting, and started shouting FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT.\n\nOnce my clenched fist went up, high into the air, the crowd realized I was okay, and roared with pride for our country, like no crowd I have ever heard before.\n\nFor the rest of my life, I will be grateful for the love shown by that giant audience of patriots that stood bravely on that fateful evening in Pennsylvania.'", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

She has not even been seen at the Republican National Convention, where other members of the Trump family were in attendance. As questions loomed over the former first lady's absence, she is now expected to appear at the Republican National Convention before it concludes.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 17, Trump's son Eric Trump revealed that both Melania and his sister Ivanka Trump will attend the convention on Thursday, July 18. Eric said that Melania and Ivanka would be \"in full force and effect\" at the convention. He added that the entire family is \"cohesive\" and is backing Trump.\n\n\"Ivanka's been an incredible supporter of my father. I think you know that; she's been in the White House for a four-year period of time and loves him dearly,\" Eric said in a conversation with CBS Mornings.\n\nMelania and Ivanka have been missing for most of Trump's 2024 campaign cycle, but it is Melania's absence from the public eye after the assassination attempt on her husband that surprised people. Other members of Trump's family joined him at the convention in the first few days, including Eric and his wife and GOP Lara Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and his fianc\u00e9e Kimberly Guilfoyle, Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos. Barron Trump, however, did not attend the event.\n\nMany called for Melania to speak at the convention, including libertarian political commentator Kennedy. In an article on Daily Mail, Kennedy blasted people with a lack of sympathy for Trump over his assassination attempt, and those who have been floating conspiracy theories.\n\nSpeaking of Melania, Kennedy wrote, \"As first lady, she intentionally steered clear of the political fray - keeping a low profile on the campaign trail and in the White House. According to her husband, she 'hates' political life - and what ordinary person wouldn't.\"\n\nKennedy then called out people who criticised Melania for her \"reluctance to get down and dirty in the partisan mud.\" \"They still seized on every opportunity to criticize her - whether it was over Christmas decorations or perceived fractures in her marriage. And the most vile among her critics even spread false smears about her son, Barron,\" she wrote.\n\nCalling for Melania to speak at the RNC, Kennedy said, \"I, for one, am looking forward to a possible Melania runaway appearance at the RNC on Thursday night - because if she speaks, it will be one of the only sane voices I've heard in some time.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

But it also comes at a personally dark moment, just days after her husband survived an attempted assassination at a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nThose close to Trump's family say the shooting deeply rattled Melania Trump, a private person who is also experiencing personal life changes beyond the shooting and her husband's campaign.\n\n\"I think she's shaken,\" said former Ambassador Ric Grenell at a Bloomberg event on Monday. Her 18-year-old son \"Barron goes to school this summer, so it's a difficult time for parents to go from having your child around all the time to leaving the nest.\"\n\nAnd then watching her husband almost be assassinated? \"I think it really shook her,\" he said.\n\nWhile the former president has been focused on his political and legal fate, Melania Trump has kept much of her life out of the public eye. She's spending time with her son and has remained involved in her business ventures while her husband travels around the country campaigning or sits in court. And she treasures her privacy.\n\nOn Thursday morning, a list of speakers for the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee did not include Melania Trump.\n\nThe former first lady hasn't remained completely out of politics. She headlined two fundraisers for the Log Cabin Republicans, a pro-LGBTQ+ rights Republican organization last spring. Both were held at Trump properties -- Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower -- and were closed to the press. But she has not held any independent public campaign events or accompanied Trump at events out on the trail beyond a few private fundraisers and voting in Florida's primary. In December of last year, she did one solo public event at a naturalization ceremony at the National Archives in Washington.\n\nMelania Trump avoided accompanying her husband to his Manhattan criminal trial that centered around an alleged affair with a porn star and payments for her silence, which Trump denied. Hope Hicks, a longtime aide to Trump, testified at his trial that Trump at one time was concerned about what his wife might think of the scandal.\n\nThroughout the scandals over the years Melania Trump has provided some critical softening to her husband's rough exterior. In 2016 after the Access Hollywood tape scandal, she claimed he was \"egged on\" to say \"dirty and bad stuff\" back in 2005. And she defended her husband as a \"gentleman. He's kind. And I know he respects women.\"\n\nBut while she has been supportive of Trump, she has remained largely disinterested in politicking. Back in 2021, a Trump adviser said she would stand by her husband if he chose to run again for president but said, \"she's not going to have her own rallies. Did she ever?\"\n\nMelania Trump was never a major presence on the campaign trail. Even in 2016, she rarely joined her husband at rallies or events. Her reluctance to be in the spotlight, however, is a departure from other recent first ladies and candidate spouses, in particular Dr. Jill Biden, who is constantly at her husband's side and keeps a robust campaign schedule, sometimes acting as the public face of the campaign while her husband is in Washington.\n\n\"Melania Trump is completely an outlier on this. Not only Jill Biden, but Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, there isn't an example of a first lady in the television era, who is this MIA during a convention. I know she's going to come, but usually at the conventions, they give a speech,\" said Kate Andersen Brower, the author of The Residence and First Women.\n\nRepublicans have complained that Melania Trump has been held to a different standard than her Democrat counterparts like Jill Biden or Michelle Obama. They point to the fact that Melania Trump, a former model, was never invited to appear on the cover of Vogue magazine, and she repeatedly said that coverage of her in the White House was \"unfair\" and \"vicious.\"\n\nWhile political spouses typically share personal anecdotes about their partner, other members of the Trump family have filled that role during the 2024 convention.\n\nTrump's daughter in law Lara Trump spoke on Tuesday. On Wednesday night, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Kai Trump addressed the arena and Eric Trump is expected to speak on Thursday night.\n\nIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner and Tiffany Trump and Michael Boulos are expected to attend on Thursday night but will not be speaking. Meanwhile Trump's 18-year-old son Barron Trump will not be attending the convention's final night in Milwaukee, according to a campaign official.\n\n\"We are all family who supports Donald Trump 100%, and anyone who is not fully out front, no one should ever assume that that means that they are any less supportive. We are 100% behind him as an entire family,\" Lara Trump told reporters at a Bloomberg event Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Son Eric provides big update", "body": "Melania Trump has remained out of the public eye since the attempted assassination of her husband, Donald Trump, at a rally in Pennsylvania. Her absence has been notable at the Republican National Convention (RNC), where other members of the Trump family have been present. Speculation about her whereabouts has been everywhere, but recent updates indicate she may appear at the convention before it ends.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 17, Eric Trump announced that Melania and his sister Ivanka Trump are scheduled to attend the RNC on Thursday, July 18. Eric assured Melania and Ivanka would be present \"in full force and effect.\" He emphasized that the entire Trump family remains united and supports Donald Trump.\n\n\"Ivanka has been an incredible supporter of my father. She was in the White House for four years and loves him dearly,\" Eric told CBS Mornings.\n\nCalls for Melania's RNC Appearance\n\nThroughout Donald Trump's 2024 campaign, both Melania and Ivanka have largely stayed out of the spotlight. Melania's prolonged absence, especially after the assassination attempt, has raised many eyebrows. While several Trump family members, including Eric and his wife Lara, Donald Trump Jr. and fianc\u00e9e Kimberly Guilfoyle, and Tiffany Trump with husband Michael Boulos, have made appearances at the RNC, Melania has remained absent. Barron Trump has also not attended the event.\n\nThere has been significant public demand for Melania to speak at the convention. Libertarian political commentator Kennedy, writing for the Daily Mail, criticized those lacking sympathy for Trump following the assassination attempt and those spreading conspiracy theories.\n\nRegarding Melania, Kennedy wrote, \"As first lady, she intentionally avoided political conflicts, keeping a low profile during the campaign and in the White House. According to her husband, she 'hates' political life - and who wouldn't?\" Kennedy condemned critics who attacked Melania for not engaging more politically, saying they took every chance to criticize her, from Christmas decorations to alleged marital issues. She added that some of the harshest critics even spread false rumors about her son, Barron.\n\nExpressing anticipation for Melania's appearance, Kennedy stated, \"I, for one, am looking forward to a possible Melania runaway appearance at the RNC on Thursday night - because if she speaks, it will be one of the only sane voices I've heard in some time.\"\n\nWhat Happens at the RNC and How Does It Work?\n\nThe RNC gathered approximately 2,400 delegates from across the United States to officially nominate Donald Trump as the party's candidate through a roll call vote. Each state announces the number of delegates they allocate to each candidate, following specific state party rules.\n\nTypically, the candidate's home state delegation, in Trump's case, Florida, will secure the nomination. However, this vote is largely ceremonial, as Trump clinched the nomination in March with 1,215 delegates and ultimately amassed 2,243 delegates by the end of the primary process, as reported by CBS News.\n\nOn Thursday night, Trump is expected to officially accept the nomination for the third time since 2016. Alongside the nomination process, the Republican Party will adopt a new platform, proposing a softened stance on abortion, and advocating for state-level decision-making on the issue. The platform also includes proposals for a missile defence shield over the U.S., tax cuts, and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.\n\nAs the RNC unfolds, all eyes are on whether Melania Trump will make her anticipated appearance, adding another layer of intrigue to an already eventful convention.", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

The former first lady was not mentioned on the list of speakers at the RNC for Thursday, but later made her official entrance to the convention floor to lilting classical music.\n\nWearing a red suit, Melania smiled and waved to supporters, before joining her husband and Vance in the box as the appplause continued.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Trump directed crowds towards Melania, saying: \"On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania.\"\n\nTo cheers, he continued: \"Melania, thank you very much. You also did something really beautiful, a letter to America, calling for national unity.\"\n\nThe former president went on to thank his entire family: \"Don, Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared, Eric and Lara, Tiffany and Michael, Barron, we love our Barron.\"\n\nBarron Trump, 18, recently made his entrance onto the political scene at a rally at Trump's Doral golf resort in Miami, Florida. Echoing his father's showmanship the teenager waved to crowds and pumped his fists, prompting Trump to joke that he was \"more popular\" than his other sons.\n\nBack in Milwaukee, Trump paid tribute to his 10 \"wonderful\" grandchildren. \"You saw a few of them up there on my lap before,\" he said.\n\nSpeculation about Melania's whereabouts have swirled for days as other members of the Trump familywere pictured on the convention floor, and in the box with the former president\n\nThe former president was also pictured dancing alongside his young grandchildren Spencer and Chloe, the children of Don Jr. He also spent time with Luke and Carolina - the children of Lara and Eric Trump.\n\nMelania's entrance in Milwaukee marks her first major political appearance with Trump since he announced his 2024 campaign almost two years ago.\n\nSources told Politico that the former first lady was deeply shaken by the shocking assassination attempt.\n\nShortly following the incident on Saturday during a campaign rally in Butler Pennsylvania, she released a statement in which she described the would-be assassin as a \"monster.\"\n\n\"When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change. I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband,\" Melania wrote.\n\n\"To the families of the innocent victims who are now suffering from this heinous act, I humbly offer my sincerest sympathy. Your need to summon your inner strength for such a terrible reason saddens me.\n\n\"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration. The core facets of my husband's life -- his human side -- were buried below the political machine. Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times.\"\n\nMelania has not remained completely out of politics, having headlined two fundraisers for the Log Cabin Republicans, a pro-LGBTQ+ rights Republican organization in spring.\n\nBoth were held at Trump properties -- Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower -- and were closed to the press. However, Melania has not held any public campaign events or accompanied Trump at events out on the trail beyond a few private fundraisers and voting in Florida's primary.\n\nDonald Jr, his

Plus: Journal Sentinel dining critic Rachel Bernhard on the state of downtown business during the RNC and ... the sales market for Trump poetry?\n\nEver since the start of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, political observers from both parties have wondered: Where is former President Donald Trump's wife, Melania? And where's his daughter and former adviser, Ivanka?\n\nFormer first lady Melania Trump and the former president's daughter Ivanka Trump have been noticeably absent, in a week of RNC events where other members of the Trump dynasty have taken center stage. Their absence have led many to wonder where they are and why they haven't shown up.\n\nNow, it looks like Milwaukee can expect to see both Melania and Ivanka at the Republican National Convention on its final day.\n\nUSA TODAY, citing unnamed officials, reported Thursday that Melania Trump will be in attendance when her husband formally accepts the GOP's nomination tonight and is expected to be seated in the family box at the RNC. Officials did not provide additional details of her arrival, or say whether she would speak to the delegates.\n\nFor most of Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, Melania has stayed out of the public eye. Her attendance later Thursday night will mark her first public appearance since speaking out about the assassination attempt on her husband.\n\nMeanwhile, Eric Trump, son of the former president, told Tony Dokoupil of \"CBS Mornings\" Thursday that both Melania and Ivanka Trump will be at the RNC in Milwaukee Thursday.\n\n\"They're coming in full force and effect, so they'll certainly be here,\" Eric Trump said.\n\nIvanka had been a prominent force in previous Trump campaigns, accompanying Trump on the 2016 campaign trail and working as a White House senior adviser in his administration.\n\nIn 2022, Ivanka announced that she was stepping away from the political limelight, focusing instead on her children \"and the private life we are creating as a family.\"", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journal Sentinel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2024_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

The beaming former first lady walked onto the floor of the arena in Milwaukee, Wisconsin , to a roaring crowd as she made her way up to the VIP box and waved.\n\nAt the end of Donald Trump's remarks, she joined him on stage where they joined hands and he gave her a kiss on the cheek. The rest of the Trump family soon gathered around them as balloon's fell from the arena's ceiling and Puccini's Nessun Dorma played.\n\nBefore Trump began his remarks - clocking in at an hour and 32 minutes - Melania walked into the Trump family box to take a seat by J.D. Vance , her husband's vice presidential nominee. But Donald Trump had already exited the box to prepare to address the delegates. Despite her distain for politics, Melania seemed happy to be at the convention, smiling and waving to the delegates.\n\nThe Trumps were together earlier in the evening, however, when Melania, wearing Dior, watched Donald sign the paperwork for him to become the Republican presidential nominee. She then stayed behind the scenes until shortly before Donald was scheduled to speak. The former first lady did not join the rest of the Trump family in walking out into the convention hall.\n\nIvanka Trump , Don Jr ., and Tiffany were all with their father in the main box in the convention hall. They listened and cheered with the crowd while Hulk Hogan and Eric Trump fired up the delegates. The former president was surrounded by his children and grandchildren as he prepared to address the convention, which marks his formal acceptance of the nomination. But Melania, who has rarely appeared on the campaign trail, waited until the last moments before his remarks to join the family.\n\nMelania sat quietly when her husband spoke, listening as he described the assassination attempt that nearly took his life. She smiled when he made little jokes but stared at her husband intently as he recounted the horrific event. He paid tribute to her during his remarks, calling her 'my amazing wife Melania.' She stood and waved as the crowd gave her a standing ovation. 'Melania thank you very much. You also did something very beautiful. A letter to America calling for national unity,' he said.\n\nMelania did not address the delegates on Thursday night, despite being offered the chance to do so. She did speak to delegates at the 2016 and 2020 conventions but, this election year, she has stayed in the shadows while her husband runs for a second term.\n\nThursday was also Ivanka Trump's first night at the convention and also marked a rare political appearance. The former first daughter is there in her 'personal capacity' to support her father, sources close to her said. She has stayed away from politics since her father decided to run for a second term, despite previously being involved in his campaigns and his administration. Her brothers have stayed active. Both Don Jr. - who addressed the convention on Wednesday - and Eric have been surrogates on the campaign trail. Eric's wife Lara joined the Republican National Committee to help run the former president's re-election effort. The family has gathered around its patriarch since an assassin attempted to kill him on July 13th.\n\nMelania Trump, who rarely makes public statements, spoke to the horror when she realized her and son Barron's life were on the brink of 'devastating change' after the hearing the news about her husband's assassination attempt. The former first lady called the gunman a 'monster' and described the moment she watched the bullet strike her husband's ear at a Pennsylvania rally in front of thousands of his adoring fans. 'A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,' Melania said in an emotional statement on X on Sunday morning.\n\n'When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change. I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband.' She called for people to 'reunite' and said she is thinking of her fellow Americans. 'This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence,' her statement continued. 'The winds of change have arrived. For those of you who cry in support, I thank you. I commend those of you who have reached out beyond the political divide - thank you for remembering that every single politician is a man or a woman with a loving family.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Her 18-year-old son \"Barron goes to school this summer, so it's a difficult time for parents to go from having your child around all the time to leaving the nest.\"\n\nAnd then watching her husband almost be assassinated? \"I think it really shook her,\" he said.\n\nWhile the former president has been focused on his political and legal fate, Melania Trump has kept much of her life out of the public eye. She's spending time with her son and has remained involved in her business ventures while her husband travels around the country campaigning or sits in court. And she treasures her privacy.\n\nOn Thursday morning, a list of speakers for the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee did not include Melania Trump.\n\nThe former first lady hasn't remained completely out of politics. She headlined two fundraisers for the Log Cabin Republicans, a pro-LGBTQ+ rights Republican organization last spring. Both were held at Trump properties -- Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower -- and were closed to the press. But she has not held any independent public campaign events or accompanied Trump at events out on the trail beyond a few private fundraisers and voting in Florida's primary. In December of last year, she did one solo public event at a naturalization ceremony at the National Archives in Washington.\n\nMelania Trump avoided accompanying her husband to his Manhattan criminal trial that centered around an alleged affair with a porn star and payments for her silence, which Trump denied. Hope Hicks, a longtime aide to Trump, testified at his trial that Trump at one time was concerned about what his wife might think of the scandal.\n\nThroughout the scandals over the years Melania Trump has provided some critical softening to her husband's rough exterior. In 2016 after the Access Hollywood tape scandal, she claimed he was \"egged on\" to say \"dirty and bad stuff\" back in 2005. And she defended her husband as a \"gentleman. He's kind. And I know he respects women.\"\n\nBut while she has been supportive of Trump, she has remained largely disinterested in politicking. Back in 2021, a Trump adviser said she would stand by her husband if he chose to run again for president but said, \"she's not going to have her own rallies. Did she ever?\"\n\nMelania Trump was never a major presence on the campaign trail. Even in 2016, she rarely joined her husband at rallies or events. Her reluctance to be in the spotlight, however, is a departure from other recent first ladies and candidate spouses, in particular Dr. Jill Biden, who is constantly at her husband's side and keeps a robust campaign schedule, sometimes acting as the public face of the campaign while her husband is in Washington.\n\n\"Melania Trump is completely an outlier on this. Not only Jill Biden, but Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, there isn't an example of a first lady in the television era, who is this MIA during a convention. I know she's going to come, but usually at the conventions, they give a speech,\" said Kate Andersen Brower, the author of The Residence and First Women.\n\nRepublicans have complained that Melania Trump has been held to a different standard than her Democrat counterparts like Jill Biden or Michelle Obama. They point to the fact that Melania Trump, a former model, was never invited to appear on the cover of Vogue magazine, and she repeatedly said that coverage of her in the White House was \"unfair\" and \"vicious.\"\n\nWhile political spouses typically share personal anecdotes about their partner, other members of the Trump family have filled that role during the 2024 convention.\n\nTrump's daughter in law Lara Trump spoke on Tuesday. On Wednesday night, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Kai Trump addressed the arena and Eric Trump is expected to speak on Thursday night.\n\nIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner and Tiffany Trump and Michael Boulos are expected to attend on Thursday night but will not be speaking. Meanwhile Trump's 18-year-old son Barron Trump will not be attending the convention's final night in Milwaukee, according to a campaign official.\n\n\"We are all family who supports Donald Trump 100%, and anyone who is not fully out front, no one should ever assume that that means that they are any less supportive. We are 100% behind him as an entire family,\" Lara Trump told reporters at a Bloomberg event Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Grenell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Grenell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

COOPER - Associated Press\n\nMelania Trump and Ivanka Trump were at the Republican National Convention Thursday, making a rare appearance in support of former President Donald Trump's third bid for president.\n\nThe former first lady and the former president's eldest daughter have largely steered clear of the campaign trail this year, a contrast with Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns when both played a larger role. Neither gave speeches.\n\nMelania Trump's presence helps the Republican Party show widespread unity, a theme that emerged prominently after the attempt on Trump's life last weekend. A day after the attack, Melania issued a statement calling on Americans to \"ascend above hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Former Lenoir-Rhyne administrator talks about diversity, inclusion at university Trump injured but 'fine' after attempted assassination at rally; shooter and one attendee are dead\n\nCampaigns often use spouses and families to humanize a candidate, but with Melania Trump taking a backseat this year, that job fell to other speakers, who painted a sympathetic portrait of Trump by sharing anecdotes of warm interactions between him and their children. Trump's 17-year-old granddaughter, Kai Trump, called him \"just a normal grandfather.\"\n\nTrump's family, minus Melania, entered the arena after Trump signed paperwork formally accepting the GOP nomination. They went to the family box and stood throughout a boisterous speech by the wrestler Hulk Hogan.\n\nMelania entered later, smiling and waving to the crowd as she walked alone into the arena and up a flight of stairs to take her seat next to vice presidential nominee JD Vance. She wore a red skirt suit as Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 played.\n\n\"On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania,\" Trump said to extended applause. \"And Melania, thank you very much.\"\n\nHe said she \"did something really beautiful\" when she wrote her statement pleading for unity after the shooting.\n\nMelania Trump later joined Trump on stage, startling him as she walked up behind him after his 93-minute speech, then whispered in his ear. The rest of the Trump family joined and balloons fell from the ceiling, an iconic tradition of political conventions. Some of Trump's younger grandchildren, big smiles on their faces, batted balloons with their hands and feet.\n\nAs the family lingered on stage for 20 minutes, Melania Trump stood by Trump's side being quietly affectionate, touching her husband's arm at times and sometimes chatting with Vance and his wife, Usha Vance.\n\nTrump's two oldest sons, Donald Trump Jr., and Eric Trump, both spoke to delegates this week, as did their partners, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Lara Trump, respectively. Daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband, Michael Boulos, were at the convention but did not speak. The president's youngest child, 18-year-old Barron Trump, did not appear at the convention. He declined an invitation to be a Florida delegate.\n\nMelania Trump has skipped key moments of her husband's campaign, including rallies and primary-night victory parties. She did not join him in court as he faced trial over hush money payments to a porn star or for his remarks responding to the guilty verdict.\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, held senior roles on Donald Trump's White House staff but did not attend Trump's 2022 announcement that he planned another presidential campaign.\n\n\"While I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena,\" Ivanka Trump said in a statement at the time.\n\n--\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Rather she shocked many people, including Republicans, present there. Former first lady Melania Trump received a grand welcome with classical music playing in the background and the crowd applauding her as she entered the Republican National Convention Thursday. But she broke the 30-year-old tradition of speaking on the stage and introducing the nominee for the US Presidential Election. Melania went straight to her seat and sat there silently, according to a report published in the MSN. Though she participated in the photo-ops and stood by the side of Donald Trump as he accepted the Republican nomination for the November 5 election, people present there did not miss the message she sent.\n\nBarbara Bush started the tradition of speaking at the RNC in 1992, she was followed by others. Melania Trump spoke at the RNC conventions of 2016 and 2020. The former model entered the event just before UFC CEO Dana White introduced Donald Trump before his address. She greeted Trump's running mate Senator JD Vance and his wife Usha. Melania also sat with them as the GOP nominee delivered his first speech since the assassination attempt at a campaign rally. Former president's daughter Ivanka Trump too did not speak at the convention. Unusually, a presidential nominee is not introduced by a spouse or family member.\n\nTrump thanked his wife for standing beside him when he was attacked. He said that he wanted to thank his entire family for being here, including Don, Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared, Eric and Lara, Tiffany and Michael, and Barron. The former model added the elements of drama and glamor as she smiled, waved, kissed and stood hand in hand with Donald Trump after he finished his acceptance speech. Her son Barron Trump did not attend the Republic National Convention though the Republican Party of Florida selected him to serve as one of the state's at-large delegates at the convention.\n\nWhich tradition did Melania Trump break at the Republic National Convention?\n\nMelania Trump broke the 30-year-old tradition of speaking on the stage and introducing the nominee for the US Presidential Election.

He was originally selected as a convention delegate from Florida but Melania's office later announced Barron would not serve as he had a 'prior commitment.'\n\nHis absence was notable, particularly after he attended one of his father's campaign rallies earlier this month, where he stood and waved to the crowd.\n\nBut Don Jr.'s and Eric's children were present. Kai Trump, 17, addressed the convention on Wednesday night, paying a sweet tribute to her grandfather.\n\nAnd Eric's daughter Carolina, four, stole the show on Thursday when she sat on Donald Trump's lap while Eric addressed the delegates.\n\nAt one point Carolina had her thumb in her mouth as her father spoke. Her older brother Eric Luke, 6, joined in on cheering on their dad as he sat on mom Lara's lap.\n\nDonald Trump, meanwhile, basked in the adoration of the delegates after he wrapped up his one hour and 32 minute speech.\n\nHe started off with a dramatic retelling of the assassination attempt on his life but then rambled, going off the teleprompter, to slam Nancy Pelosi and name-check rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe delegates in the hall appeared restless with many taking their seats and taking out their phones. A few fell asleep.\n\nThey rallied for the grand finale however, roaring their approval as the Trump family took the stage to wave as balloons rained down around them.\n\nSince the assassination attempt on him on July 13th, Trump has had his family at his side.\n\nMost of them were on hand Thursday night to see him crowned as the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nHis children walked onto the convention floor with him.\n\nLater, Melania Trump, in a bright red skirt suit by Dior, made a dramatic entrance, walking into the arena to cheers and the music from Beethoven's symphony no. 9.\n\nShe was introduced to the roaring crowd as the future first lady.\n\nMelania Trump only joined the convention on its last night, taking her seat in the Trump family box shortly before Donald began his remarks.\n\nIvanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner also only attended on Thursday night. The couple joined Don Jr. and Tiffany in the family box to sit with their father while Eric Trump addressed the crowd.\n\nThe former president was surrounded by his children and grandchildren as he prepared to address the delegates.\n\nHis family - except for Barron - was on hand while he spoke.\n\nMelania sat quietly during his speech, listening as he described the assassination attempt that nearly took his life. She smiled when he made little jokes but stared at her husband intently as he recounted the horrific event.\n\nDonald paid tribute to her during his remarks, calling her 'my amazing wife Melania.' She stood and waved as the crowd gave her a standing ovation.\n\n'Melania thank you very much. You also did something very beautiful. A letter to America calling for national unity,' he said.\n\nHe also thanked the rest of his family.\n\nMelania and Ivanka have stayed away from politics since Donald decided to run for a second term.\n\nBut both Don Jr. - who addressed the convention on Wednesday - and Eric have been surrogates on the campaign trail. Eric's wife Lara joined the Republican National Committee to help run the former president's re-election effort.\n\nThe family has gathered around its patriarch since an assassin attempted to kill him on July 13th.\n\nMelania Trump, who rarely makes public statements, spoke to the horror when she realized her and son Barron's life were on the brink of 'devastating change' after the hearing the news about her husband's assassination attempt.\n\nThe former first lady called the gunman a 'monster' and described the moment she watched the bullet strike her husband's ear at a Pennsylvania rally in front of thousands of his adoring fans.\n\n'A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,' Melania said in an emotional statement on X on Sunday morning.\n\n'When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change.

They were joined by their family, Vice President candidate JD Vance, and his spouse Usha Chilukuri at the Republican National Convention.\n\nShe wore a tailored red suit jacket and skirt as she walked out after the Trump family and Erik Trump's speech.\n\nThe former first lady joined all of Trump's children, their spouses, and their young children as they await for him to take the stage.\n\nDuring Trump's first speech since his assassination attempt on Saturday, the former president turned the attention to Melania.\n\n\"On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania,\" he said.\n\nIt comes as:\n\nShe got a standing ovation from the crowd as she rose and waved from the family box.\n\nTrump also thanked his wife for her letter to the American people after the shooting which he said \"took the Republican party by surprise.\"\n\nBREAKING TRADITION\n\nMelania was asked to speak at the convention, but she declined the offer, sources told CNN.\n\nShe had previously spoken at the RNC, introducing Trump in 2016 and 2020.\n\nInstead, Dana White, the CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, will introduce Donald Trump before his big speech at the RNC on Thursday night.\n\nDeclining to give an introduction speech for Trump breaks the traditional order of political events.\n\nIn the past, the candidate's husband or wife makes a speech to humanize them and share personal anecdotes.\n\nKEY TO SUCCESS\n\nDespite being present at this event, Melania has opted to distance herself from Trump's third presidential campaign. She has been seen at only two political events since the beginning of the campaign.\n\nShe attended the kickoff event in November 2022 at their Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Florida, and was also seen voting with Trump during the Florida presidential primary in March 2024.\n\nMelania missed the first two days of the RNC, but attendees are hoping to get a glimpse of her on Thursday night.\n\n\"I hope we'll see Melania this week,\" Marietta Bailey of West Bend, Wisconsin, told The U.S. Sun.\n\n\"I get all of my inspiration and fashion from her, she's amazing. An icon.\"\n\nAnother person said her appearance at the three-day event would be important to Trump's campaign.\n\n\"It would be nice to see her because it shows she would be invested in this election cycle,\" said Amy Jamieson from Chicago.\n\n\"I think we'll have to wait and see. It was nice to see prominent members of his family with him Monday.\"\n\nJamieson said she watched Trump make the \"emotional walk\" across the during his first appearance since the assassination attempt that rocked the world at one of his rallies in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe former president moved at the last moment narrowly missing a bullet aimed for his head, leaving him with a bloodied ear.\n\nJamieson was impressed by his strength and determination to walk on stage in front of thousands only days after the terrifying incident.\n\n\"I think we want somebody who's strong to get back on the horse and get going and that's what he did last night,\" she said.\n\n\"So, if Melania shows up, I think that would be just a little bit better.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine what it would be like to be married to the president, and having that traumatic event that happened this weekend,\" said Kathleen Hoban from Sussex, Wisconsin.\n\n\"I think, for her to come here and support him would be one of the biggest benefits to his nomination, and I think they really need to step in together as a family.\"\n\n'MONSTER'\n\nFollowing the assassination attempt, Melania released a statement on Sunday on X.\n\nIn her lengthy letter that called for unity across parties and the remembrance of love, she slammed the gunman 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, branding him a \"monster.\"\n\nShe also accused him of trying to \"ring out Donald's passion.\"\n\n\"His laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration. The core facets of my husband's life - his human side - were buried below the political machine,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times.\"\n\nShe then spoke about how differing opinions and politics are \"inferior to love.\"\n\n\"Our personal, structural, and life commitment - until death - is a serious risk,\" she shared.\n\n\"Political concepts are simple when compared to us, human beings.\"\n\nShe added, \"Let us remember that when the time comes to look beyond the left and the right, beyond the red and the blue, we all come from families with the passion to fight for a better life together, while we are here, in this earthly realm.\"\n\nMelania also mentioned change at the start and end of her statement -- she wrote \"devastating change\" and \"the winds of change.\"\n\nPeople close to the Trump family shared with Politico that Melania was deeply unnerved after the shooting.\n\n\"I think she's shaken,\" former Ambassador Richard Grenell said at a Bloomberg event, per Politico.\n\n\"Barron goes to school this summer, so it's a difficult time for parents to go from having your child around all the time to leaving the nest.\"", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

COOPER - Associated Press\n\nMelania Trump and Ivanka Trump were at the Republican National Convention Thursday, making a rare appearance in support of former President Donald Trump's third bid for president.\n\nThe former first lady and the former president's eldest daughter have largely steered clear of the campaign trail this year, a contrast with Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns when both played a larger role. Neither gave speeches.\n\nMelania Trump's presence helps the Republican Party show widespread unity, a theme that emerged prominently after the attempt on Trump's life last weekend. A day after the attack, Melania issued a statement calling on Americans to \"ascend above hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Trump's 17-year-old granddaughter, Kai Trump, called him \"just a normal grandfather.\"\n\nTrump's family, minus Melania, entered the arena after Trump signed paperwork formally accepting the GOP nomination. They went to the family box and stood throughout a boisterous speech by the wrestler Hulk Hogan.\n\nMelania entered later, smiling and waving to the crowd as she walked alone into the arena and up a flight of stairs to take her seat next to vice presidential nominee JD Vance. She wore a red skirt suit as Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 played.\n\n\"On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania,\" Trump said to extended applause. \"And Melania, thank you very much.\"\n\nHe said she \"did something really beautiful\" when she wrote her statement pleading for unity after the shooting.\n\nMelania Trump later joined Trump on stage, startling him as she walked up behind him after his 93-minute speech, then whispered in his ear. The rest of the Trump family joined and balloons fell from the ceiling, an iconic tradition of political conventions. Some of Trump's younger grandchildren, big smiles on their faces, batted balloons with their hands and feet.\n\nAs the family lingered on stage for 20 minutes, Melania Trump stood by Trump's side being quietly affectionate, touching her husband's arm at times and sometimes chatting with Vance and his wife, Usha Vance.\n\nTrump's two oldest sons, Donald Trump Jr., and Eric Trump, both spoke to delegates this week, as did their partners, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Lara Trump, respectively. Daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband, Michael Boulos, were at the convention but did not speak. The president's youngest child, 18-year-old Barron Trump, did not appear at the convention. He declined an invitation to be a Florida delegate.\n\nMelania Trump has skipped key moments of her husband's campaign, including rallies and primary-night victory parties. She did not join him in court as he faced trial over hush money payments to a porn star or for his remarks responding to the guilty verdict.\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, held senior roles on Donald Trump's White House staff but did not attend Trump's 2022 announcement that he planned another presidential campaign.\n\n\"While I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena,\" Ivanka Trump said in a statement at the time.\n\n--\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Donald Trump Jr. and Eric attended the convention with other family members.While Melania Trump did not attend any event this year, she arrived at the Republican National Convention and supported Donald Trump on Thursday. Melania and Ivanka Trump demonstrated their support for Donald Trump at the RNC in a very noticeable way. The former first lady and her stepdaughter joined Donald Trump on stage at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, wearing matching red and white outfits. To sign paperwork accepting the GOP nomination to challenge President Joe Biden in the next election, Donald Trump was present, as per the reports of 'Page Six'.\n\nThe 54-year-old former first lady confidently stood next to her husband at the event while sporting a red skirt suit. To show her support, Ivanka Trump, 42, wore a matching white suit with accent buttons. Donald Trump's son Eric Trump was also present. Eric said that Ivanka has been a great supporter and that the family has stayed very close during their political careers.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2021, Ivanka Trump acted as a top counselor to Donald Trump during his administration. It was clear that she supported her father during the RNC by standing by him. Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband, and Tiffany Trump, the youngest of Donald Trump's daughters, were also present in the crowd.\n\nAs per the reports of 'Page Six', Donald Trump Jr. brought his daughter Kai Trump with him to the RNC as well. Kai, a seventeen-year-old, stood up to show her support for her grandpa. She characterized Donald Trump as a proud, active, and compassionate grandfather who takes delight in his family's accomplishments. Kai added that Donald Trump is committed to inspiring his grandchildren even in the face of his continuous legal troubles, which include his latest conviction for falsifying corporate records.\n\nWho attended the 2024 Republican National Convention with Donald Trump?\n\nMelania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Kai Trump were present, showing their support for Donald Trump as he accepted the GOP nomination for the upcoming election.\n\nWhat role did Ivanka Trump have during Donald Trump's presidency?\n\nIvanka Trump served as a senior advisor to Donald Trump from 2017 to 2021, supporting him in h", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Kushner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Kushner"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111870935,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-1885847,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

She seemed as inscrutable and distant as ever.\n\nShe joined him on stage after his lengthy acceptance speech, walking to the podium just before balloons rained down on thousands in the crowd. Donald Trump greeted her with a hug and the pair shared a kiss on the cheek.\n\nHe then grabbed her hand and walked across the stage as other members of the Trump family joined them.\n\nEver since her husband was first elected in 2016, Melania Trump has broken all the rules of normal American presidential politics.\n\nIn the White House during Trump's first term, she was a reclusive figure compared to other first ladies, focusing on a narrow set of interests. The US national archives descibes her as having been an \"ambassador for kindness\" and an advocate for children's issues.\n\nAnd since her husband left office, she has refused to be seen by her husband's side on many occasions when the public would expect her to be present.\n\nShe wasn't there when he had his mugshot taken in Atlanta. She wasn't there in New York when he became the first former president to be convicted of a crime. And she wasn't there when he officially won his party's presidential nomination, for the third time, on Monday.\n\nFollow live updates on this story\n\nFive takeaways from Trump's convention speech\n\nWatch: 'It can only be a bullet' - Trump describes moment he was shot at\n\nRepublicans put abortion disagreements aside at 'unity' convention\n\nThe Trump family: A guide to an American dynasty\n\n\"Melania does what Melania wants,\" said Mary Jordan, who wrote The Art of her Deal, a biography on the former first lady. \"She is fiercely independent and won't do something just because other people do it. She doesn't feel any obligation to do it.\"\n\nWe are now all accustomed to the fact that she doesn't turn up at many of Donald Trump's events, but on Monday, when he walked into the arena here in Milwaukee to a roaring welcome, greeted like a Messiah after his survival of the assassination attempt, her absence felt particularly obvious.\n\nIt was certainly noticed by the Republicans gathered here, but that didn't mean they weren't excited for her appearance, when it finally came.\n\nMelania is the most enigmatic first lady in modern history and we rarely hear what she thinks.\n\nAn exception was the lengthy statement she released after the shooting targeting her husband, which read as though she may have dictated it directly.\n\n\"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,\" she said.\n\n\"The core facets of my husband's life - his human side - were buried below the political machine. Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times.\"\n\nIt is traditional at party conventions for the candidate's spouse to give a speech and tell heavily-scripted anecdotes about family life.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Usha Vance - the wife of Trump's newly-minted running mate JD Vance - did just that. She called her husband a \"meat and potatoes\" man, but - in an apparent sign of his devotion - said he now cooked her Indian vegetarian food.\n\nAnd while Donald Trump's oldest son Don Jr, middle son Eric, daughter-in-law Lara and granddaughter Kai have all spoken at this convention, Melania has declined the opportunity to speak. She very clearly does not do anything she does not want to do.\n\nWhen she did introduce her husband at the 2016 convention when he first ran for president - things went horribly wrong.\n\nShe was criticised for plagiarising the speech Michelle Obama gave in 2008 when she introduced her husband Barack at the Democratic convention. Melania's speechwriter later accepted the blame.\n\nFirst ladies are always heavily scrutinised for the image they project, the causes they adopt, and the clothes they wear.\n\nBut Melania Trump is the first who was previously a professional model. She looks fabulous in photographs and is well aware of the power of her image. By offering so few photo opportunities, she makes each one infinitely more powerful.\n\n\"She is very savvy and has cultivated the mystery woman mystique by going underground and then when she does come out, it's a much bigger deal,\" says Ms Jordan.\n\n\"She doesn't appear very often, but she does show up when Donald Trump really needs her.\"\n\nAfter Saturday's attempt on his life, Melania felt MIA. But on Thursday night, as she slowly walked the stairs to the VIP section, paused at the top and waved to all corners of the arena, she showed her mastery of the power of an image.\n\nHer absence may, at times, be her strength.\n\nWhat Republicans want from a second Trump presidency\n\nLara Trump's meteoric rise signals changing of Trump family guard", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType":

COOPER - Associated Press\n\nMelania Trump and Ivanka Trump were at the Republican National Convention Thursday, making a rare appearance in support of former President Donald Trump's third bid for president.\n\nThe former first lady and the former president's eldest daughter have largely steered clear of the campaign trail this year, a contrast with Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns when both played a larger role. Neither gave speeches.\n\nMelania Trump's presence helps the Republican Party show widespread unity, a theme that emerged prominently after the attempt on Trump's life last weekend. A day after the attack, Melania issued a statement calling on Americans to \"ascend above hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Trump's 17-year-old granddaughter, Kai Trump, called him \"just a normal grandfather.\"\n\nTrump's family, minus Melania, entered the arena after Trump signed paperwork formally accepting the GOP nomination. They went to the family box and stood throughout a boisterous speech by the wrestler Hulk Hogan.\n\nMelania entered later, smiling and waving to the crowd as she walked alone into the arena and up a flight of stairs to take her seat next to vice presidential nominee JD Vance. She wore a red skirt suit as Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 played.\n\n\"On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania,\" Trump said to extended applause. \"And Melania, thank you very much.\"\n\nHe said she \"did something really beautiful\" when she wrote her statement pleading for unity after the shooting.\n\nMelania Trump later joined Trump on stage, startling him as she walked up behind him after his 93-minute speech, then whispered in his ear. The rest of the Trump family joined and balloons fell from the ceiling, an iconic tradition of political conventions. Some of Trump's younger grandchildren, big smiles on their faces, batted balloons with their hands and feet.\n\nAs the family lingered on stage for 20 minutes, Melania Trump stood by Trump's side being quietly affectionate, touching her husband's arm at times and sometimes chatting with Vance and his wife, Usha Vance.\n\nTrump's two oldest sons, Donald Trump Jr., and Eric Trump, both spoke to delegates this week, as did their partners, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Lara Trump, respectively. Daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband, Michael Boulos, were at the convention but did not speak. The president's youngest child, 18-year-old Barron Trump, did not appear at the convention. He declined an invitation to be a Florida delegate.\n\nMelania Trump has skipped key moments of her husband's campaign, including rallies and primary-night victory parties. She did not join him in court as he faced trial over hush money payments to a porn star or for his remarks responding to the guilty verdict.\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, held senior roles on Donald Trump's White House staff but did not attend Trump's 2022 announcement that he planned another presidential campaign.\n\n\"While I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena,\" Ivanka Trump said in a statement at the time.\n\n--\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Vance as his running mate, a new addition to the inner circle.\n\n\"He couldn't choose one of his sons or daughters or daughter-in-law, that just wouldn't work, of course,\" Natasha Lindstaedt, a political scientist at the University of Essex, told AFP.\n\n\"J.D. Vance and Don Jr. are very close. So he chose someone that maybe reminds him of his son or is close to his son,\" she said.\n\nA notable absence on the campaign trail this year, however, has been former first lady Melania Trump, who has been all but invisible throughout Trump's rallies and protracted court appearances.\n\n- Where is Melania? -\n\nIn a marked break from precedent, Melania has been largely absent in recent months from her husband's political life, with the notable exception of a fiery statement after an attempted assassination attempt on him on Saturday.\n\nIn this file photo, former president Donald Trump and his first lady Melania Trump meet Indian prime minister Narendra Modi on February 24, 2020\n\nPrior to that, however, she had spoken sparingly and not accompanied her husband during court appearances in a case that saw him convicted of covering up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had a sexual encounter with the real estate tycoon.\n\n\"She's a complete enigma,\" Lindstaedt said, adding that the former model did not \"play the typical role\" of a former first lady.\n\n\"Although she seemed to share similar views to Trump on a lot of issues, not on all, but on a lot of issues, she has a very conservative world view, she doesn't seem to care that much what people think and kind of does her own thing.\"\n\n- Three generations -\n\nThe rest of Trump's family has offered the former president a way to soften his image in the aftermath of the recent convictions and other legal woes.\n\nHis eldest granddaughter, 17-year-old Kai Trump, spoke at the RNC Wednesday night to describe the \"very caring and loving\" patriarch.\n\nTrump's eldest granddaughter, 17-year-old Kai Trump, spoke at the RNC Wednesday night to describe the \"very caring and loving\" patriarch\n\n\"He's just a normal grandpa, he gives us candy and soda when our parents aren't looking,\" she said.\n\nThe teenage daughter of Donald Jr. spoke of their shared love of golf, even when the former president tries to psych her out when playing against her.\n\n\"I don't let him get to me, but I have to remind him I'm a Trump, too,\" she said.\n\n- Nepotism -\n\nLike wagons hitched to their father's train, Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka have been pulled along to success, along with their friends and families.\n\nLindstaedt pointed to two examples of Trump spouses achieving power: Eric Trump's wife Lara Trump, who was recently appointed co-chair of the Republican National Committee, and Ivanka's husband Jared Kushner, who Trump appointed as an advisor and entrusted with figuring out peace in the Middle East.\n\nEric Trump's wife Lara Trump was recently appointed co-chair of the Republican National Committee\n\n\"Suddenly people who have no expertise, no training, no ethics training, maybe they're not even going properly through security clearances, are given access to the most powerful positions,\" Lindstaedt said.\n\n\"And we see when this happens in non-democracies and the dictatorships, how it usually goes very badly.\"\n\nNatalie Koch, who researches geopolitics and authoritarianism at Syracuse University, said Trump's nepotism is nothing new.\n\n\"The Trump organization is a family business, but once he took office the first time, and then you could really see that he brought that into the political realm and into the White House,\" Koch told AFP.\n\n- Children's roles -\n\nEach of Trump's children has been entrusted with different duties during this campaign.\n\nDon Jr., the eldest at age 46, is a big proponent of his father's far-right \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA) ideology.\n\nSpeaking at the Republican National Convention, he extolled the image of his father raising his fist after the assassination attempt last weekend.\n\nIvanka, 42, had played a role in Trump's administration but has since devoted herself to personal matters.\n\nEric, 40, has doubled down on Trump's claims that the 2020 election was rigged.

According to HuffPost, her presence sparked debate as Melania disrupted a long-standing custom by immediately making her way to her seat.\n\nIn 2016 and 2020, Melania delivered remarks at the RNC, as is typical for the wives of presidential candidates. However, she deviated from the convention this year. Since her husband began his third run for president in November 2022, the former first lady has been noticeably recluse. According to several reports, Melania has been trying to distance herself from her husband's political appearances for months.\n\nA source informed People in April, \"Melania is not now or hasn't recently taken part in her husband's political events. It is not comfortable for her.\" They explained, \"Melania can be aloof and not particularly friendly because she simply wants to be left alone.\" The former First Lady was also reportedly furious with her husband over his alleged affair with adult film star, Stormy Daniels, which brought much embarrassment.\n\nHowever, Melania recently broke her silence after the failed attempt to assassinate the former president. In her message, she emphasized that \"respect is paramount and family is first.\" As reported by USA Today, she shared, \"When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life was on the brink of devastating change.\"\n\nShe condemned, \"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion, his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration. The core facets of my husband's life, his human side, were buried below the political machine. Donald is a generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times.\"\n\nDonald in response, expressed his gratitude to Melania during his GOP nominee acceptance speech, praising her 'beautiful letter' to America post his assault at the Pennsylvania rally. As per the Independent, he said, \"On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania. Melania, thank you very much. You also did something really beautiful, a letter to America, calling for national unity.\"\n\nThe former First Lady eventually did join Donald on stage, kissing him on the cheek when he finished. As hundreds of red, white, and blue balloons descended, the couple clasped hands with members of the Trump family. Much like Melania, Donald's eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, has also mostly avoided the campaign trail, in contrast to her prominent role in her father's 2016 and 2020 campaigns, choosing not to speak a the convention.", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HuffPost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HuffPost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barron's_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barron's (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/705984/uploads/ab03c490-45b6-11ef-9866-3790ece5385a_1200_630.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 13, "textEnd": 20}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

COOPER - Associated Press\n\nMelania Trump and Ivanka Trump were at the Republican National Convention Thursday, making a rare appearance in support of former President Donald Trump's third bid for president.\n\nThe former first lady and the former president's eldest daughter have largely steered clear of the campaign trail this year, a contrast with Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns when both played a larger role. Neither gave speeches.\n\nMelania Trump's presence helps the Republican Party show widespread unity, a theme that emerged prominently after the attempt on Trump's life last weekend. A day after the attack, Melania issued a statement calling on Americans to \"ascend above hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Trump's 17-year-old granddaughter, Kai Trump, called him \"just a normal grandfather.\"\n\nTrump's family, minus Melania, entered the arena after Trump signed paperwork formally accepting the GOP nomination. They went to the family box and stood throughout a boisterous speech by the wrestler Hulk Hogan.\n\nMelania entered later, smiling and waving to the crowd as she walked alone into the arena and up a flight of stairs to take her seat next to vice presidential nominee JD Vance. She wore a red skirt suit as Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 played.\n\n\"On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania,\" Trump said to extended applause. \"And Melania, thank you very much.\"\n\nHe said she \"did something really beautiful\" when she wrote her statement pleading for unity after the shooting.\n\nMelania Trump later joined Trump on stage, startling him as she walked up behind him after his 93-minute speech, then whispered in his ear. The rest of the Trump family joined and balloons fell from the ceiling, an iconic tradition of political conventions. Some of Trump's younger grandchildren, big smiles on their faces, batted balloons with their hands and feet.\n\nAs the family lingered on stage for 20 minutes, Melania Trump stood by Trump's side being quietly affectionate, touching her husband's arm at times and sometimes chatting with Vance and his wife, Usha Vance.\n\nTrump's two oldest sons, Donald Trump Jr., and Eric Trump, both spoke to delegates this week, as did their partners, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Lara Trump, respectively. Daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband, Michael Boulos, were at the convention but did not speak. The president's youngest child, 18-year-old Barron Trump, did not appear at the convention. He declined an invitation to be a Florida delegate.\n\nMelania Trump has skipped key moments of her husband's campaign, including rallies and primary-night victory parties. She did not join him in court as he faced trial over hush money payments to a porn star or for his remarks responding to the guilty verdict.\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, held senior roles on Donald Trump's White House staff but did not attend Trump's 2022 announcement that he planned another presidential campaign.\n\n\"While I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena,\" Ivanka Trump said in a statement at the time.\n\n--\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

She did stride through the arena in Milwaukee, though, getting a few minutes of screen time as classic music played.\n\nKid Rock performed an abrasive \"Fight!

The former president continued sporting a bandage on Thursday, covering the wound where the would-be assassin's bullet grazed his right ear.\n\nIn response to the shooting, Melania issued a rare public statement. \"When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change.\" she wrote. \"Let us remember that when the time comes to look beyond the left and the right, beyond the red and the blue, we all come from families with the passion to fight for a better life together, while we are here, in this earthly realm.\"\n\nThe former first lady has largely disengaged from her husband's political life since leaving the White House.

Vance (R-OH).\n\nBut one person missing from this happy Trump family image was his son Barron Trump. After making a halt and getting a standing ovation. 18-year-old was not expected to attend the RNC after Melania's office had made a statement after Republican Party of Florida had picked him to serve as one of the state's at-large delegates at the convention.\n\n\"While Barron is honoured to have been chosen... he regretfully declines to participate due to prior commitments,\" Melania's office said.\n\nDespite his absence Donald didn't forget to remember him in the speech, \"I also wanna thank my entire family for being here. Don, Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared. Eric and Lara. Tiffany and Michael. Barron.\" Trump paused, smiling, and mumbled, \"We love our Barron.\" The crowd laughed.\n\nTrump's memorable day at RNC after surviving assassination bid marked Melania's first public appearance with her husband since his conviction on all counts in the hush money trial. However, the former first lady didn't utter a word and neither did she speak the convention. Many were expecting her to speak for the husband but Melania chose to remain silent.\n\nHer presence at the RNC was a powerful gesture of unity, especially after months of keeping a low profile. As Trump concluded his 93-minute speech, Melania surprised him by joining him on stage, where she whispered in his ear and shared a brief kiss. This move not only underscored her support but also helped the Republican Party project a united front following the recent assassination attempt on Trump.\n\nMelania, who has largely been absent from the campaign trail, previously distanced herself following the scandal and subsequent guilty verdict and not seen campaigning with Trump. The party noted she was busy taking care of her ailing mother, who passed away earlier this year. According to reports, the trial and verdict were also \"very hard\" on her, and she chose to remain silent and out of the public eye to protect herself and their son, Barron.\n\nBut today as the Trump family celebrated on stage, Melania remained close to her husband, sharing moments of quiet affection and engaging with other family members, including vice presidential nominee JD Vance and his wife, Usha.\n\nThe last time Melania was seen publicly with Trump was at their son Barron's graduation ceremony in May 2024. After the verdict, she was photographed leaving Trump Tower with Barron, both looking somber and carrying several luxury luggage pieces, heading to their estate in Bedminste.\n\nDespite her low profile, Melania's statement calling for Americans to \"ascend above hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence\" after the attack on Trump highlighted her concern for the nation's current political climate. Her appearance at the convention, albeit without delivering a speech, added a layer of emotional support to Trump's campaign.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Guilfoyle", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Guilfoyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Kushner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jared Kushner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanessa Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Her husband, Eric, has made the rounds on cable news. Another Trump son, Donald Trump Jr., spoke for 19 minutes Wednesday night, long enough even to hand the mic to his teenage daughter, Kai.\n\nAnd yet, where is Melania?\n\nDonald Trump's wife has remained out of sight. She has not been in the VIP box where Trump has presided over the prime-time show each night. She has not been on television. She is sparsely featured in the videos played for delegates between speakers and in the photos plastered on the arena's walls.\n\nMelania Trump is set to appear Thursday as her husband delivers his acceptance speech on the convention's final night. But, in a break from tradition, she is not expected to speak. (Other Trumps are likely to make their first appearances, too: Ivanka, the former president's daughter who is keeping a distance from his current campaign, and Barron, 18, Donald Trump's youngest son.)\n\nAt this celebration of all things Trump, nobody knows quite what to make of this.\n\nScott Walker, the former governor of Wisconsin, speculated Wednesday from the floor of the convention hall that it is probably just \"too overwhelming\" for Melania Trump, given the assassination attempt on her husband Saturday. \"I think it's going to be emotional even to be with him,\" Walker said, \"let alone speak.\"\n\nAsked about the former first lady Tuesday, Matt Schlapp, a former White House aide, shrugged. \"I don't know whether she's coming or not,\" he said. \"Melania has always taken full measure of her ability to have private time for as long as possible. I know that she's completely behind this campaign.\"\n\nMelania Trump has been disappearing from view for a while now. She did not show up at her husband's trial for falsifying business records to cover up hush payments to Stormy Daniels, a porn actor who claimed to have had a tryst with him while his wife was home with a newborn. So far in this campaign, Melania Trump has done two fundraisers with gay Republicans, but little else.\n\n\"Melania will be out whenever it's appropriate for her,\" Lara Trump said in an interview with The New York Times last week. \"Just because people are not overtly out front with banners or signs or whatever it might be, doesn't mean they are not 100% on board.\"\n\nMelania Trump was overtly out front at the last two Republican conventions.\n\nIn 2016, she gave a speech that plagiarized chunks of a Michelle Obama speech. In 2020, when the country was being rocked by COVID-19 and unrest after the death of George Floyd, Melania Trump delivered a speech from the Rose Garden that was seen as more compassionate than anything at that convention. \"I know many people are anxious, and some feel helpless,\" she said then. \"I want you to know that you are not alone.\"\n\nOrdinarily, wives play a central role at these conventions, humanizing their spouse. Donald Trump has relied on his son's wife and former aides to do that this time around.\n\n\"Last night, when we heard Lara, she told us a lot of things that we already knew about Donald, but we didn't know his personal side, his family side, how compassionate he really is,\" a Nebraska delegate, Mary Gerdes, said Wednesday. Did she think it was odd that the candidate's wife seemed to want nothing to do with this convention? \"It would've been great to hear from her,\" Gerdes said, \"but she's had a rough week.\"\n\nAfter Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981, Nancy Reagan rushed to the emergency room to be by his side, spending the next 13 days at the hospital with him. (\"Honey, I forgot to duck,\" Ronald Reagan told his wife.)\n\nDonald Trump's wife was not by his side for his first public appearance since the shooting here Monday. She did put out a letter, though. \"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion,\" she wrote, citing her husband's \"laughter\" and his \"love of music.\"\n\nOn Wednesday night, Trump chose to walk out onto the convention floor to James Brown's \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" (it was the version featuring Luciano Pavarotti).\n\nThis is a man's world, but it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl.\n\nA little while later, the founder of Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk, watched as Kai Trump spoke onstage. At this introduction of yet another Trump, Kirk smiled and remarked that \"this political dynasty goes a lot longer than liberals realize.\"\n\nMelania Trump's role in that dynasty, however, continues to be a mystery. Kirk, asked if he thought she would join her husband in the White House if he won in November, wouldn't even speculate. \"I have no idea.\"", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news",

The former First Lady has been notably absent on the campaign trail -- but apparently, she was just biding her time to make a dramatic entrance.\n\nWearing a red skirt suit, Melania entered the convention center to loud applause as Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 played, and she waved and smiled. In the Trump-family box, she joined Eric, Donald Jr., Tiffany, and Ivanka. The couple's 18-year-old son, Barron, was MIA, but the family laughed when Trump said in his speech later that night that \"everybody loves Barron.\"\n\nMelania and Ivanka have both kept their distance from Trump's second run for office. In November 2022, Ivanka, who worked as an adviser to her father when he was president, said she wouldn't be participating this time around. Meanwhile, Melania hasn't said much at all, though after Trump got shot at a rally last weekend, she released a rare -- and long and wordy -- statement calling on Americans to \"ascend above the hate.\"\n\nOn Thursday night, Trump gave Melania a shout-out in his rambling 90-minute acceptance speech, saying he was \"deeply honored\" to be joined by his \"amazing wife,\" and thanked her for her statement. \"You also did something really beautiful -- a letter to America calling for national unity -- and it really took the Republican Party by surprise. It was beautiful.\" Melania joined Trump onstage and even went so far as to give him an air-kiss on the cheek.\n\nNothing like an assassination attempt to bring this couple together, I guess?", "source": {"uri": "thecut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Cut"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tariro_mzezewa@thecut.com", "name": "Tariro Mzezewa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._9_(Beethoven)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_&_Co.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany & Co."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/89d/017/8d1f592221418984266780aa47a4439d77-GettyImages-2162609941.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have been fixtures of the convention. Lara Trump, Eric's wife, spoke Tuesday as the co-chair of the Republican Party. Donald Trump Jr.'s teenage daughter, Kai, spoke Wednesday night, after the younger Mr. Trump's longtime fianc\u00e9e, Kimberly Guilfoyle. Tiffany Trump, Mr. Trump's younger daughter, was in the audience on Monday.\n\nBut Mr. Trump's wife, his youngest son and his older daughter have been notably absent -- not just this week, but throughout the campaign. (Barron Trump, 18, has not appeared in the family seats Thursday night.)\n\nMelania Trump, whose politics and relationship with her husband have long drawn considerable interest, has largely opted out of this campaign. Her last known political appearance with Mr. Trump was when they went together to cast their primary ballots on Super Tuesday in March. The next week, he clinched the nomination.\n\nAs Mr. Trump took the stage, Mrs. Trump was seated next to J.D.

Ms. Trump, a mother of three, has focused on family life and has not appeared on the campaign trail.\n\nBarron Trump has always been removed from his father's political life: His mother, Melania Trump, has fiercely protected his privacy and has kept him close. He graduated in May from a private school in South Florida, an event Mr. Trump attended in the middle of his criminal trial in Manhattan.\n\nJust a week before his graduation, Barron was chosen as a Florida delegate to the Republican National Convention. For a moment, it seemed Barron might wade into politics -- but just two days later, his mother \"regretfully\" declined on his behalf, citing other commitments.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Barron showed up in the crowd at a rally in Doral, where Mr. Trump called to him from the stage.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lara Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Kushner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jared Kushner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Guilfoyle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Guilfoyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Tuesday", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Tuesday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Headlines and memes varied on the color, describing the dress as lime green, bright green, very green ... Only one commonality seemed to unite all jokes, news reports and TikToks about Melania Trump's 2020 RNC dress: She definitely was easy to spot among the Trump family and the crowd (see photos below).\n\nWill Melania Trump be at the 2024 Republican National Convention?\n\nMelania Trump has rarely been seen in public during the 2024 campaign of her husband, former president Donald Trump.

When she stepped off Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport three hours later, the third Mrs. Trump sported a much more colorful, Florida-style caftan.\n\n\"Being your first lady was my greatest honor,\" Trump said minutes before boarding Air Force One with the former president. \"Thank you for your love and your support. You will be (in) my thoughts and prayers, God bless you all. God bless your families, and God bless this beautiful nation.\"\n\nWith her hair in a loose chignon, Melania Trump wore a cropped Chanel jacket over a Dolce & Gabbana black dress along with her Christian Louboutin stilettos and a crocodile Hermes Birkin.\n\nThe Trumps opted to skip the Inauguration Day festivities of President Joe Biden and head back to their private beach club Mar-a-Lago instead.\n\nMelania Trump's outfit, a long-sleeve orange, white and navy blue Gucci patterned dress, apparently cost $3,700, according to the designer website.\n\nMelania Trump's 'I don't really care. Do U?' jacket\n\nOn June 21, 2018, former first lady Melania Trump arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, wearing a Zara jacket that read, \"I don't really care.

Ivanka and Melania were all smiles as the former president signed documents to accept the GOP nomination in the upcoming election.\n\nMelania took the stage in an all-red ensemble, while Ivanka decided to wear a similar all-white look. The pair wore elegant suits for the event and styled their hair straight. \"Ivanka has been an incredible supporter of my father,\" Eric, who was also present, revealed on Tuesday. \"There's no family in political history that has remained closer,\" he added.\n\nIvanka's support comes after it was reported that she would not be involved in politics following her exit from The White House. The former first daughter served as a senior advisor from 2017 to 2021 during the Trump administration.\n\nIvanka attended the event with her husband Jared Kushner, and was photographed next to Tiffany Trump, who also wore white. Trump has been receiving a lot of support and appreciation from his family, following the assassination attempt.\n\nHis 17-year-old granddaughter was also present on Wednesday and shared a personal story. \"He always wants to know how we're doing in school. When I made the high honor roll, he printed it out to show his friends how proud he was of me,\" Kai Trump said, adding that to her \"he's just a normal grandpa.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Melania shared a statement after the attack. \"When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "hola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hola.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiserv_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiserv Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

JD Vance's wife, Usha Vance, spoke about her husband on Wednesday.\n\nBut Melania has never been a typical first lady and has notably withdrawn from her husband's political endeavors since leaving the White House in 2021.\n\nShe does not attend Trump's rallies or event speeches. She did not attend any day of her husband's criminal trial in New York. She rarely makes a public statement about Trump - although she did after the recent assassination attempt.\n\nMelania's decision to forego an RNC speech is not surprising, but it is unclear what her exact reasoning was behind this.\n\nIn 2016, Melania faced intense scrutiny when reporters realized her speech was heavily inspired, if not directly taken, from Michelle Obama's 2016 Democratic National Convention speech. It was an embarrassing moment for Melania given the speech was her first major step into the political spotlight alongside her husband.\n\nBut in 2020, Melania delivered a long speech directly addressing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, unlike Trump.\n\nIt is unclear if the former first lady will be making more appearances on the campaign trail now that her husband is the official Republican nominee.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/bd31f5b6bfb9ab5b9c61fd7a306b9eab", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The US national archives descibes her as having been an \"ambassador for kindness\" and an advocate for children's issues.\n\nAnd since her husband left office, she has refused to be seen by her husband's side on many occasions when the public would expect her to be present.\n\nShe wasn't there when he had his mugshot taken in Atlanta. She wasn't there in New York when he became the first former president to be convicted of a crime. And she wasn't there when he officially won his party's presidential nomination, for the third time, on Monday.\n\n\"Melania does what Melania wants,\" said Mary Jordan, who wrote The Art of her Deal, a biography on the former first lady. \"She is fiercely independent and won't do something just because other people do it. She doesn't feel any obligation to do it.\"\n\nWe are now all accustomed to the fact that she doesn't turn up at many of Donald Trump's events, but on Monday, when he walked into the arena here in Milwaukee to a roaring welcome, greeted like a Messiah after his survival of the assassination attempt, her absence felt particularly obvious.\n\nIt was certainly noticed by the Republicans gathered here, but that didn't mean they weren't excited for her appearance, when it finally came.\n\nMelania is the most enigmatic first lady in modern history and we rarely hear what she thinks.\n\nAn exception was the lengthy statement she released after the shooting targeting her husband, which read as though she may have dictated it directly.\n\n\"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,\" she said.\n\n\"The core facets of my husband's life - his human side - were buried below the political machine. Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times.\"\n\nIt is traditional at party conventions for the candidate's spouse to give a speech and tell heavily-scripted anecdotes about family life.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Usha Vance - the wife of Trump's newly-minted running mate JD Vance - did just that. She called her husband a \"meat and potatoes\" man, but - in an apparent sign of his devotion - said he now cooked her Indian vegetarian food.\n\nAnd while Donald Trump's oldest son Don Jr, middle son Eric, daughter-in-law Lara and granddaughter Kai have all spoken at this convention, Melania has declined the opportunity to speak. She very clearly does not do anything she does not want to do.\n\nWhen she did introduce her husband at the 2016 convention when he first ran for president - things went horribly wrong.\n\nShe was criticised for plagiarising the speech Michelle Obama gave in 2008 when she introduced her husband Barack at the Democratic convention. Melania's speechwriter later accepted the blame.\n\nFirst ladies are always heavily scrutinised for the image they project, the causes they adopt, and the clothes they wear.\n\nBut Melania Trump is the first who was previously a professional model. She looks fabulous in photographs and is well aware of the power of her image. By offering so few photo opportunities, she makes each one infinitely more powerful.\n\n\"She is very savvy and has cultivated the mystery woman mystique by going underground and then when she does come out, it's a much bigger deal,\" says Ms Jordan.\n\n\"She doesn't appear very often, but she does show up when Donald Trump really needs her.\"\n\nAfter Saturday's attempt on his life, Melania felt MIA. But on Thursday night, as she slowly walked the stairs to the VIP section, paused at the top and waved to all corners of the arena, she showed her mastery of the power of an image.", "source": {"uri": "dailynews.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classical music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Messiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speechwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speechwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_in_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missing in action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Potato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegetarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 71}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nIvanka Trump made her return to politics and her father's campaign trail on Thursday night as she joined her family on stage to close out the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe former president's eldest daughter worked as a senior adviser in the Trump administration but - following his exit from the White House in January 2021 in the wake of the January 6 Capitol riot - has distanced herself from his releection goals and the world of politics altogether.\n\nAfter leaving Washington DC, Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner moved to Miami with their three children.\n\nAnd when, in November 2022, Donald Trump announced that he would run for the White House for a third time, she made it clear she did not want to return to politics. \"I love my father very much,\" she wrote in a statement at the time. \"This time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics.\"\n\nBut, on Thursday night, Ivanka made a rare public appearance at the RNC as her father accepted the Republican party's presidential nomination and delivered a record-breaking, 93-minute long speech to his supporters, in what marked his first public comments since an assassination attempt at the weekend.\n\nDressed in a white suit and joined by Kushner and other members of the Trump family in the family box, Ivanka beamed as Trump's wife Melania entered the Milwaukee auditorium to rapturous applause.\n\nThe two women - who have both avoided taking part in Trump's 2024 campaign to date - then joined Trump on stage as he and vice presidential pick JD Vance signed paperwork formally accepting the GOP nomination.\n\nThe night continued to be a family affair with several Trump family members all joining the presidential candidate on stage after his speech, as the crowd went wild and red, white and blue balloons filled the air.\n\nOne of the Trump children was noticeable absent: his youngest son Barron Trump.\n\nMelania's office said back in May that Barron \"regretfully\" could not accept an invitation to attend as a delegate due to prior, unspecified, commitments.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump thanked his family members as he gave a shout-out to his wife, children and their partners.\n\n\"On this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania. And, Melania, thank you very much. You also did something really beautiful, a letter to America calling for national unity,\" he said.\n\n\"I also want to thank my entire family -- Don and Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared, Eric and Lara, Tiffany and Michael, Barron, we love our Barron. And of course, my 10 wonderful grandchildren.\"\n\nBut, despite the show of unity, Ivanka and Melania notably both missed the first three days of the convention - a contrast to Don Jr, Eric and Tiffany who were seen there every day.\n\nNeither Ivanka nor Melania gave speeches at the four-day event either - something both did at both the 2016 and 2020 convention.\n\nDespite being absent from his 2024 campaign events to date and her bid to keep a low-profile, Ivanka did put out a statement in the wake of the assassination attempt on her father last week.\n\n\"Thank you for your love and prayers for my father and for the other victims of today's senseless violence in Butler, Pennsylvania,\" she wrote on Instagram.\n\n'I am grateful to the Secret Service and all other law enforcement officers for their quick and decisive actions today. I continue to pray for our country.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Kushner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jared Kushner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/19/06/5177caa393a84d098f14e8ae204ac0a4.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 485, "textEnd": 494}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

One common thread seemed to unite all the jokes, reports, and TikToks about Melania Trump's dress at the 2020 RNC: It was definitely easy to spot among the Trump family and the crowd (see photos below).\n\nMelania Trump has rarely been seen in public during her husband, former President Donald Trump,'s 2024 campaign. The low-key wife is expected to be in the family box for her husband's remarks, officials said, but they would not otherwise comment on her activities.\n\nIt's a far cry from the Republican National Convention the week of Aug. 24, 2020, when then-first lady Melania Trump, dressed in a military-style suit, spoke from the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, seeking to offer comfort to families suffering during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOn August 27, 2020, the final day of the 2020 Republican National Convention, former first lady Melania Trump wore a lime green Valentino gown on the night of her husband's acceptance speech for the Republican nomination.\n\nAlso in attendance at the 2020 RNC were Barron Trump, his only son with former President Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump and Tiffany Trump, and their extended families.\n\nThe \"green screen dress,\" however, wasn't the only occasion on which Melania Trump's fashion choices made headlines.\n\nLeaving the White House in Washington, D.C., on January 20, 2021, the day of President Joe Biden's inauguration, first lady Melania Trump wore a sleek black suit. When she stepped off Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport three hours later, the third Mrs. Trump wore a much more colorful, Florida-style caftan.\n\n\"Serving as your first lady has been my greatest honor,\" Trump said minutes before boarding Air Force One with the former president. \"Thank you for your love and support. You will be in my thoughts and prayers, God bless you all. God bless your families and God bless this great nation.\"\n\nWith her hair in a loose bun, Melania Trump wore a short Chanel jacket over a black Dolce & Gabbana dress, along with her Christian Louboutin stilettos and a crocodile Herm\u00e8s Birkin.\n\nThe Trumps opted to skip President Joe Biden's Inauguration Day festivities and instead return to their private Mar-a-Lago beach club.\n\nMelania Trump's outfit, a long-sleeved orange, white and navy patterned Gucci dress, reportedly cost $3,700, according to thedesigner website.\n\nOn June 21, 2018, former first lady Melania Trump arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland wearing a Zara jacket that read, \"I really don't care. Do you?\" after visiting the Upbring New Hope Children's Center, run by Southern Lutheran Social Services in McAllen, Texas. She later explained that it was \"for the people and for the left-wing media that are criticizing me.\"", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [],

She seemed as inscrutable and distant as ever.\n\nEver since her husband was first elected in 2016, Melania Trump has broken all the rules of normal American presidential politics.\n\nIn the White House during Trump's first term, she was a reclusive figure compared to other first ladies, focusing on a narrow set of interests. The US national archives descibes her as having been an \"ambassador for kindness\" and an advocate for children's issues.\n\nAnd since her husband left office, she has refused to be seen by her husband's side on many occasions when the public would expect her to be present.\n\nShe wasn't there when he had his mugshot taken in Atlanta. She wasn't there in New York when he became the first former president to be convicted of a crime. And she wasn't there when he officially won his party's presidential nomination, for the third time, on Monday.\n\n\"Melania does what Melania wants,\" said Mary Jordan, who wrote The Art of her Deal, a biography on the former first lady. \"She is fiercely independent and won't do something just because other people do it. She doesn't feel any obligation to do it.\"\n\nWe are now all accustomed to the fact that she doesn't turn up at many of Donald Trump's events, but on Monday, when he walked into the arena here in Milwaukee to a roaring welcome, greeted like a Messiah after his survival of the assassination attempt, her absence felt particularly obvious.\n\nIt was certainly noticed by the Republicans gathered here, but that didn't mean they weren't excited for her appearance, when it finally came.\n\nMelania entered the hall shortly before her husband was set to speak and officially accept the Republican nomination\n\nMelania is the most enigmatic first lady in modern history and we rarely hear what she thinks.\n\nAn exception was the lengthy statement she released after the shooting targeting her husband, which read as though she may have dictated it directly.\n\n\"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,\" she said.\n\n\"The core facets of my husband's life - his human side - were buried below the political machine. Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times.\"\n\nIt is traditional at party conventions for the candidate's spouse to give a speech and tell heavily-scripted anecdotes about family life.\n\nShe made her way up to the family VIP box to listen to her husband's speech\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Usha Vance - the wife of Trump's newly-minted running mate JD Vance - did just that. She called her husband a \"meat and potatoes\" man, but - in an apparent sign of his devotion - said he now cooked her Indian vegetarian food.\n\nAnd while Donald Trump's oldest son Don Jr, middle son Eric, daughter-in-law Lara and granddaughter Kai have all spoken at this convention, Melania has declined the opportunity to speak. She very clearly does not do anything she does not want to do.\n\nWhen she did introduce her husband at the 2016 convention when he first ran for president - things went horribly wrong.\n\nShe was criticised for plagiarising the speech Michelle Obama gave in 2008 when she introduced her husband Barack at the Democratic convention. Melania's speechwriter later accepted the blame.\n\nMelania's last public statement came after her husband was nearly assassinated at a rally\n\nFirst ladies are always heavily scrutinised for the image they project, the causes they adopt, and the clothes they wear.\n\nBut Melania Trump is the first who was previously a professional model. She looks fabulous in photographs and is well aware of the power of her image. By offering so few photo opportunities, she makes each one infinitely more powerful.\n\n\"She is very savvy and has cultivated the mystery woman mystique by going underground and then when she does come out, it's a much bigger deal,\" says Ms Jordan.\n\n\"She doesn't appear very often, but she does show up when Donald Trump really needs her.\"\n\nAfter Saturday's attempt on his life, Melania felt MIA. But on Thursday night, as she slowly walked the stairs to the VIP section, paused at the top and waved to all corners of the arena, she showed her mastery of the power of an image.", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@the-star.co.ke", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classical music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Messiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

What will ex-model wear this time?", "body": "Will Melania Trump attend the 2024 Republican National Convention?\n\nAnd, if so, what will the former first lady (and former model) wear?\n\nAlmost four years ago, during the 2020 Republican National Convention, Melania Trump appeared on the final evening wearing what the internet called a \"green screen dress.\"\n\nIt was actually a fluorescent green Valentino spring 2020 pleated-crepe dress featuring a sleeveless A-line silhouette and caped shoulders, finishing the look off with a skinny, dark pink belt, according to Vanity Fair. Headlines and memes varied on the color, describing the dress as lime green, bright green, very green ... Only one commonality seemed to unite all jokes, news reports and TikToks about Melania Trump's 2020 RNC dress: She definitely was easy to spot among the Trump family and the crowd (see photos below).\n\nMelania Trump has rarely been seen in public during the 2024 campaign of her husband, former president Donald Trump. The low-profile spouse is expected to be in the family box for her husband's remarks, officials said, but they would not otherwise comment on her activities.\n\nIt's a far cry from the Republican National Convention the week of Aug. 24, 2020, when then-first lady Melania Trump - wearing a military-style suit - spoke from the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, seeking to provide comfort to families suffering during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOn Aug. 27, 2020, the final day of the 2020 Republican National Convention, former first lady Melania Trump wore the Valentino lime green dress on the night of her husband's acceptance speech for the Republican nomination.\n\nAlso in attendance at the 2020 RNC? Barron Trump, her only son with former president Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump and Tiffany Trump, and their extended families.\n\nThe \"green screen dress,\" however, was not the only time Melania Trump's fashion choices made headlines.\n\nAs she left the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20, 2021, or Inauguration Day for President Joe Biden, first lady Melania Trump donned a sleek black suit. When she stepped off Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport three hours later, the third Mrs. Trump sported a much more colorful, Florida-style caftan.\n\n\"Being your first lady was my greatest honor,\" Trump said minutes before boarding Air Force One with the former president. \"Thank you for your love and your support. You will be (in) my thoughts and prayers, God bless you all. God bless your families, and God bless this beautiful nation.\"\n\nWith her hair in a loose chignon, Melania Trump wore a cropped Chanel jacket over a Dolce & Gabbana black dress along with her Christian Louboutin stilettos and a crocodile Hermes Birkin.\n\nThe Trumps opted to skip the Inauguration Day festivities of President Joe Biden and head back to their private beach club Mar-a-Lago instead.\n\nMelania Trump's outfit, a long-sleeve orange, white and navy blue Gucci patterned dress, apparently cost $3,700, according to the designer website.\n\nOn June 21, 2018, former first lady Melania Trump arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, wearing a Zara jacket that read, \"I don't really care. Do U?\" after visiting the Upbring New Hope Children Center run by the Lutheran Social Services of the South in McAllen, Texas. She later explained it was \"for the people and for the left-wing media who are criticizing me.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Vance as his running mate, a new addition to the inner circle.\n\n\"He couldn't choose one of his sons or daughters or daughter-in-law, that just wouldn't work, of course,\" Natasha Lindstaedt, a political scientist at the University of Essex, told AFP.\n\n\"J.D. Vance and Don Jr. are very close. So he chose someone that maybe reminds him of his son or is close to his son,\" she said.\n\nA notable absence on the campaign trail this year, however, has been former first lady Melania Trump, who has been all but invisible throughout Trump's rallies and protracted court appearances.\n\nIn a marked break from precedent, Melania has been largely absent in recent months from her husband's political life, with the notable exception of a fiery statement after an attempted assassination attempt on him on Saturday.\n\nPrior to that, however, she had spoken sparingly and not accompanied her husband during court appearances in a case that saw him convicted of covering up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had a sexual encounter with the real estate tycoon.\n\n\"She's a complete enigma,\" Lindstaedt said, adding that the former model did not \"play the typical role\" of a former first lady.\n\n\"Although she seemed to share similar views to Trump on a lot of issues, not on all, but on a lot of issues, she has a very conservative world view, she doesn't seem to care that much what people think and kind of does her own thing.\"\n\nThe rest of Trump's family has offered the former president a way to soften his image in the aftermath of the recent convictions and other legal woes.\n\nHis eldest granddaughter, 17-year-old Kai Trump, spoke at the RNC Wednesday night to describe the \"very caring and loving\" patriarch.\n\n\"He's just a normal grandpa, he gives us candy and soda when our parents aren't looking,\" she said.\n\nThe teenage daughter of Donald Jr. spoke of their shared love of golf, even when the former president tries to psych her out when playing against her.\n\n\"I don't let him get to me, but I have to remind him I'm a Trump, too,\" she said.\n\nLike wagons hitched to their father's train, Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka have been pulled along to success, along with their friends and families.\n\nLindstaedt pointed to two examples of Trump spouses achieving power: Eric Trump's wife Lara Trump, who was recently appointed co-chair of the Republican National Committee, and Ivanka's husband Jared Kushner, who Trump appointed as an adviser and entrusted with figuring out peace in the Middle East.\n\n\"Suddenly people who have no expertise, no training, no ethics training, maybe they're not even going properly through security clearances, are given access to the most powerful positions,\" Lindstaedt said.\n\n\"And we see when this happens in non-democracies and the dictatorships, how it usually goes very badly.\"\n\nNatalie Koch, who researches geopolitics and authoritarianism at Syracuse University, said Trump's nepotism is nothing new.\n\n\"The Trump organization is a family business, but once he took office the first time, and then you could really see that he brought that into the political realm and into the White House,\" Koch told AFP.\n\nEach of Trump's children has been entrusted with different duties during this campaign.\n\nDon Jr., the eldest at age 46, is a big proponent of his father's far-right \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA) ideology.\n\nSpeaking at the Republican National Convention, he extolled the image of his father raising his fist after the assassination attempt last weekend.\n\nIvanka, 42, had played a role in Trump's administration but has since devoted herself to personal matters.\n\nEric, 40, has doubled down on Trump's claims that the 2020 election was rigged. At the convention, he appeared with delegates from Florida and claimed -- without evidence -- that the Democratic Party was planning to win this year's election fraudulently.\n\nTrump's fourth child, Tiffany, 30, was also in attendance at the Republican National Convention.\n\nHis youngest child, 18-year-old Barron, whom he had with current wife Melania, appears to take after his mother's preference for the background, declining to be a delegate from Florida at the convention this year.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

including his children, grandchildren and wife - joined him on stage as balloons fell from the ceiling and younger members of the family batted them with their hands and feet.\n\nShowing slight signs of affection, the former first lady was seen occasionally touching her husband's arm and chatting with Mr Trump's newly appointed pick for vice president, JD Vance.\n\nThe presence of the presidential nominee's family comes as the Republican Party sought to portray him as a caring family man and selfless public servant who has been unfairly represented by Democratic opponents.\n\nThis image makeover -

He is now engaged to Kimberly Guilfoyle.\n\nLike his brother, Eric Trump, the third of the former president's children, has lobbied his father about issues important to him, according to reports.\n\nHe has kept a less public persona than his older brother but also maintains a leading presence in the Trump family business.\n\nIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner were arguably the most influential members of the former president's family during Trump's first stint in the White House.\n\nThe pair have been married since 2009 and share three children.\n\nDuring the former president's time in the White House, Ivanka Trump made numerous appearances on behalf of her father and his administration.\n\nKushner held a senior adviser role in the White House from 2017 to 2021.\n\nThe fourth child of the former president and the only one of Trump's children born to his second wife, Marla Maples.\n\nShe has not maintained any political role in her father's campaigns or time in the White House.\n\nShe has been married to Michael Boulos since 2022.\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr have been together for six years and engaged since 2020.\n\nShe was a Fox News presenter from 2006 to 2018, before leaving to become a member of a pro-Trump super PAC.\n\nLike her fianc\u00e9, she has been an outspoken supporter of the former president, particularly in TV appearances.\n\nShe was married to California Governor Gavin Newsom in the early 2000s.\n\nMarried to Eric, she is the rising star of the family, particularly since she began serving as RNC co-chair earlier this year. She has two children with Eric.\n\nShe told the convention what the former president was like as a father-in-law.\n\nFormer First Lady Melania Trump has been married to Trump since 2005.\n\nShe maintained a low profile during Trump's term in office and has rarely made public appearances since.\n\nWhile she has held Republican fundraisers in the past year, her expected appearance at the RNC this week would be her first major appearance of this election cycle.\n\nBarron Trump, 18, is her only child with Trump.\n\nBarron Trump made a campaign appearance earlier this month with his father, but otherwise has largely stayed out of the spotlight.\n\nIn May, it was reported he would be among the delegates from the state of Florida who would attend the RNC in July, but a day later his mother stated that he had declined the offer.\n\nHe graduated in May from Oxbridge Academy in Palm Beach, Florida, and will head to university in the autumn, according to Trump. However, the family has not said which institution he will attend.\n\nKai Trump is the eldest of Trump's grandchildren and the daughter of Donald Trump Jr and his former wife Vanessa Trump.\n\nThe 17-year-old is an avid golfer and spoke at the RNC on Wednesday about what Trump is like as a grandfather.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Guilfoyle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Guilfoyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Kushner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jared Kushner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanessa Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marla_Maples", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marla Maples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--W3PjCeoy--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1721334948/4KMT2SG_000_364F9W2_jpg?_a=BACCd2AD", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The former first lady's only public moments included standing behind Trump while he signed his official nomination paperwork.\n\nUnlike her speeches at the 2016 and 2020 conventions, Melania did not address the audience this year. Her limited campaign involvement has garnered attention, particularly in light of recent events. As Donald Trump concluded his lengthy speech, Melania joined him on stage, sharing an awkward kiss and holding hands amidst falling balloons.\n\nIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who held influential positions in the Trump White House, were notably absent from Donald Trump's 2022 campaign announcement.\n\nIvanka, a 42-year-old mother of three, had introduced her father at the previous two conventions and served as a senior adviser during his presidency.

Vance as his running mate, a new addition to the inner circle.\n\n\"He couldn't choose one of his sons or daughters or daughter-in-law, that just wouldn't work, of course,\" Natasha Lindstaedt, a political scientist at the University of Essex, told AFP.\n\n\"J.D. Vance and Don Jr. are very close. So he chose someone that maybe reminds him of his son or is close to his son,\" she said.\n\nA notable absence on the campaign trail this year, however, has been former first lady Melania Trump, who has been all but invisible throughout Trump's rallies and protracted court appearances.\n\n- Where is Melania? -\n\nIn a marked break from precedent, Melania has been largely absent in recent months from her husband's political life, with the notable exception of a fiery statement after an attempted assassination attempt on him on Saturday.\n\nPrior to that, however, she had spoken sparingly and not accompanied her husband during court appearances in a case that saw him convicted of covering up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had a sexual encounter with the real estate tycoon.\n\n\"She's a complete enigma,\" Lindstaedt said, adding that the former model did not \"play the typical role\" of a former first lady.\n\n\"Although she seemed to share similar views to Trump on a lot of issues, not on all, but on a lot of issues, she has a very conservative world view, she doesn't seem to care that much what people think and kind of does her own thing.\"\n\n- Three generations -\n\nThe rest of Trump's family has offered the former president a way to soften his image in the aftermath of the recent convictions and other legal woes.\n\nHis eldest granddaughter, 17-year-old Kai Trump, spoke at the RNC Wednesday night to describe the \"very caring and loving\" patriarch.\n\n\"He's just a normal grandpa, he gives us candy and soda when our parents aren't looking,\" she said.\n\nThe teenage daughter of Donald Jr. spoke of their shared love of golf, even when the former president tries to psych her out when playing against her.\n\n\"I don't let him get to me, but I have to remind him I'm a Trump, too,\" she said.\n\n- Nepotism -\n\nLike wagons hitched to their father's train, Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka have been pulled along to success, along with their friends and families.\n\nLindstaedt pointed to two examples of Trump spouses achieving power: Eric Trump's wife Lara Trump, who was recently appointed co-chair of the Republican National Committee, and Ivanka's husband Jared Kushner, who Trump appointed as an advisor and entrusted with figuring out peace in the Middle East.\n\n\"Suddenly people who have no expertise, no training, no ethics training, maybe they're not even going properly through security clearances, are given access to the most powerful positions,\" Lindstaedt said.\n\n\"And we see when this happens in non-democracies and the dictatorships, how it usually goes very badly.\"\n\nNatalie Koch, who researches geopolitics and authoritarianism at Syracuse University, said Trump's nepotism is nothing new.\n\n\"The Trump organization is a family business, but once he took office the first time, and then you could really see that he brought that into the political realm and into the White House,\" Koch told AFP.\n\n- Children's roles -\n\nEach of Trump's children has been entrusted with different duties during this campaign.\n\nDon Jr., the eldest at age 46, is a big proponent of his father's far-right \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA) ideology.\n\nSpeaking at the Republican National Convention, he extolled the image of his father raising his fist after the assassination attempt last weekend.\n\nIvanka, 42, had played a role in Trump's administration but has since devoted herself to personal matters.\n\nEric, 40, has doubled down on Trump's claims that the 2020 election was rigged. At the convention, he appeared with delegates from Florida and claimed -- without evidence -- that the Democratic Party was planning to win this year's election fraudulently.\n\nTrump's fourth child, Tiffany, 30, was also in attendance at the Republican National Convention.\n\nHis youngest child, 18-year-old Barron, whom he had with current wife Melania, appears to take after his mother's preference for the background, declining to be a delegate from Florida at the convention this year.\n\nmav/llu/jgc/aha/acb", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

Her stately introduction stood in stark contrast with the previous speaker, the professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, who ripped his shirt off in a particularly bombastic display.\n\nMelania was then followed up by a lively Kid Rock performance afterwards.\n\nShe had earlier been pictured backstage alongside Trump by The New York Times as the former president met her upon arrival.\n\nMelania moved towards the VIP box solo, where she was sandwiched between vice presidential pick J.D. Vance and Trump's second son, Eric.\n\nThe former first lady spoke in both 2020 and 2016. She was accused of borrowing from Michelle Obama's 2008 speech in her first appearance in 2016.\n\nOn CNN, Kaitlan Collins, citing sources, said \"they tried really hard to get her to give a speech tonight,\" adding that \"several people personally appealed to her and she had no interest in doing so.\"\n\nMelania sat stoically in the VIP box and did not appear to mingle with the family gathered at the event. She appeared to be a mix of seriousness and smiles as she waited for husband Donald to take the stage. Barron Trump was not in attendance.\n\nAs Kid Rock raged on, Melania remained seated, despite the rest of the family giving him a standing ovation.\n\nMelania has been notably absent from the 2024 campaign trail, making only a few private appearances.

They went to the family box and stood throughout lengthy speech.\n\nMs Trump entered later, smiling and waving to the crowd as she walked alone into the arena and up a flight of stairs to take her seat next to vice presidential nominee JD Vance.\n\n\"On this journey, I am deeply honoured to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania,\" Trump said to extended applause. \"And Melania, thank you very much.\"\n\nHe said she \"did something really beautiful\" when she wrote her statement pleading for unity after the shooting.\n\nLater she joined Trump on stage, startling him as she walked up behind him after his 93-minute speech, then whispered in his ear.\n\nThe rest of the Trump family joined and balloons fell from the ceiling, an iconic tradition of political conventions.\n\nAs the family lingered on stage for 20 minutes, Ms Trump stood by Trump's side being quietly affectionate, touching her husband's arm at times and sometimes chatting with Vance and his wife, Usha Vance.\n\nMs Trump has been absent from key moments of her husband's current campaign, including rallies and primary-night victory parties. She did not join him in court as he faced trial over hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels or for his remarks responding to the guilty verdict.\n\nIvanka Trump, the former president's eldest daughter, who also played a more visible part in the 2016 and 2020 campaigns but has not been a major feature of this current one, was also present.

Vance as his running mate, a new addition to the inner circle.\n\n\"He couldn't choose one of his sons or daughters or daughter-in-law, that just wouldn't work, of course,\" Natasha Lindstaedt, a political scientist at the University of Essex, told AFP.\n\n\"J.D. Vance and Don Jr. are very close. So he chose someone that maybe reminds him of his son or is close to his son,\" she said.\n\nA notable absence on the campaign trail this year, however, has been former first lady Melania Trump, who has been all but invisible throughout Trump's rallies and protracted court appearances.\n\n- Where is Melania? -\n\nIn a marked break from precedent, Melania has been largely absent in recent months from her husband's political life, with the notable exception of a fiery statement after an attempted assassination attempt on him on Saturday.\n\nPrior to that, however, she had spoken sparingly and not accompanied her husband during court appearances in a case that saw him convicted of covering up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had a sexual encounter with the real estate tycoon.\n\n\"She's a complete enigma,\" Lindstaedt said, adding that the former model did not \"play the typical role\" of a former first lady.\n\n\"Although she seemed to share similar views to Trump on a lot of issues, not on all, but on a lot of issues, she has a very conservative world view, she doesn't seem to care that much what people think and kind of does her own thing.\"\n\n- Three generations -\n\nThe rest of Trump's family has offered the former president a way to soften his image in the aftermath of the recent convictions and other legal woes.\n\nHis eldest granddaughter, 17-year-old Kai Trump, spoke at the RNC Wednesday night to describe the \"very caring and loving\" patriarch.\n\n\"He's just a normal grandpa, he gives us candy and soda when our parents aren't looking,\" she said.\n\nThe teenage daughter of Donald Jr. spoke of their shared love of golf, even when the former president tries to psych her out when playing against her.\n\nMore from this section Copenhagen Offers Prizes to Eco-Friendly Tourists - TaiwanPlus News Must See!

At the convention, he appeared with delegates from Florida and claimed -- without evidence -- that the Democratic Party was planning to win this year's election fraudulently.\n\nTrump's fourth child, Tiffany, 30, was also in attendance at the Republican National Convention.\n\nHis youngest child, 18-year-old Barron, whom he had with current wife Melania, appears to take after his mother's preference for the background, declining to be a delegate from Florida at the convention this year.\n\nmav/llu/jgc/aha/acb", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "moises_avila@reformer.com", "name": "Mois\u00e9s \u00c1vila", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

Credit: Marc Nozell from Merrimack, New Hampshire, USA, CC BY 2.0 , via Wikimedia Commons\n\nMelania Trump made a seldom-seen public appearance on Thursday night at the Republican National Convention, seemingly demonstrating her support for her husband Donald Trump. However, she deviated from the customary practice of delivering a speech at the event.\n\nMelania emerged from the backstage area and proceeded to go onto the convention floor while the choral symphony composed by Ludwig Van Beethoven, Symphony No. 9 in D Minor, Op. 125 was being played through the loudspeakers. Her dignified presentation was noticeably different from that of the preceding speaker, the professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, who tore off his shirt in a particularly flamboyant manner.\n\nSubsequently, a spirited Kid Rock performance followed Melania's appearance.The New York Times had already captured an image of her backstage with Trump as he greeted her upon her arrival.\n\nMelania Trump proceeded towards the VIP box alone, where she found herself positioned between vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance and Eric, Trump's second son. The ex-president's wife delivered speeches in 2020 and 2016. On her initial public appearance in 2016, she faced allegations of plagiarizing Michelle Obama's 2008 speech.\n\nAccording to sources reported by Kaitlan Collins on CNN, concerted efforts were made to persuade her to deliver a speech tonight. Despite repeated personal appeals, she expressed no inclination to do so.\n\nMelania remained composed in the VIP box and did not seem to socialize with the assembled family members at the occasion. She exuded a combination of gravitas and joy as she patiently awaited her husband, Donald's appearance on stage. Barron Trump was absent.\n\nWhile Kid Rock performed energetically, Melania remained seated, unlike the rest of the family, who enthusiastically stood up to applaud him.\n\nMelania's presence on the 2024 campaign trail has been conspicuously limited, with only a few discreet appearances. Following the recent assassination attempt on Donald Trump, she issued a statement denouncing political violence and also provided her admirers with some intimate details about her personal life.\n\n\"When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of a devastating change. I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband,\" Melania wrote.\n\nTrump acknowledged Melania's attendance and implied that her statements had been incorporated into the \"Republican platform.\"\n\n\"Melania, thank you very much. You also did something beautiful, a letter to America calling for national unity.\" He said her note \"really took the Republican party by surprise. It captivated so many,\" Trump stated.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._9_(Beethoven)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kid Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Choir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ludwig van Beethoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrimack,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merrimack, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merrimack, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaitlan_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kaitlan Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Spouses of presidential hopefuls traditionally address the RNC crowd; Melania herself took the stage in both the 2016 and 2020 conventions, where her speeches bore striking resemblances to those of former first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nThis appearance follows shortly after Melania's public statement regarding the assassination attempt on Donald Trump last Saturday at a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania. \"When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realised my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change,\" she said in her statement.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump watches Hulk Hogan rip off his shirt in fiery RNC speech as he dubs ex-President 'heroic'\n\nThe final day of the conference has seen a wide variety of speakers, from the general manager of Trump's golf resorts to former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan, who shredded his shirt in front of attendees as he shared his passion for \"Trumpmania.\"\n\nFormer first lady Melania Trump was cheered loudly when mentioned by other speakers during the previous nights, but she finally entered the arena on the final night wearing a red jacket and pencil skirt suit and waving to the crowds.\n\nMelania has been conspicuously absent from the ex-president's campaign trail, reports the Mirror US.\n\nThe former First Lady appeared dressed all in red as she walked into the Milwaukee convention hall, shortly before her husband took to the stage.

It quickly drew criticism, however, with CNN noting that it didn't have specific policy or legislation goals and that much of what it accomplished came through partnerships that already existed in the federal government.\n\nMelania Trump won't give a speech Thursday, though she will be accompanying the president at the Republican National Convention.\n\nNewsNation's Robert Sherman reports that Melania Trump has missed several key moments of her husband's campaign, including the announcement that he is running in 2024 and the first presidential debate.\n\nBarron Trump graduated high school in 2024. His childhood consisted of attending \"prestigious\" private schools on Manhattan's Upper West Side, People magazine wrote.\n\nWhen his dad was elected president, Barron Trump and Melania stayed in Manhattan so he could finish the school year, then moved to Maryland and into the White House that summer. He graduated high school in May.\n\nPeople writes that even though he's Donald Trump's son, Barron Trump has largely stayed out of the spotlight.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. is the former president's eldest son and an executive vice president of the Trump Organization.\n\nThe Trump Organization website states that Donald Trump Jr. \"works to expand the company's real estate, retail, commercial, hotel and golf interests\" as an executive of their Florida-based business.\n\n\"He is involved in all aspects of the company's development, from deal evaluation, analysis and pre-development planning to construction, branding, marketing, operations, sales and leasing,\" the website said.\n\nAt the Republican National Convention, Donald Trump Jr. made a speech praising his father for his actions after the assassination attempt at a rally on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"It's a choice between one team that wants to build this country up and another that wants to tear this country down,\" Donald Trump Jr. said.\n\nLike his older brother, Eric Trump is an executive vice president at his father's company, overseeing its management and operations, including new project acquisition, development and construction, per the Trump Organization.\n\nSpeaking to NewsNation's Chris Cuomo on Wednesday night, Eric Trump said the attempted assassination of his father changed his father's message and that he \"probably realized what's important in life.\"\n\n\"He realized he could have been dead,\" Eric Trump said. \"Had he not moved his face one inch ... you would have had a former president, very likely future president, get executed on TV.\"\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e of Donald Trump Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle, is an American TV personality and prosecutor who received a law degree from the University of San Francisco in 1994, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said.\n\nBefore entering a relationship with Donald Trump Jr., Guilfoyle was married to Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, making her a first lady from 2003 to 2005 when Newsom was mayor of San Francisco.\n\nWhile the Journal Sentinel writes that she's probably best known for being on the Court TV show \"Both Sides\" and Fox News' \"The Five,\" she's made other television appearances as well and even has her own eponymous show.\n\nOn Tuesday, Guilfoyle spoke at the RNC to say November will be \"the most important election in our lifetime,\" according to USA Today.\n\nOldest daughter Ivanka Trump was an adviser to her father when he was president but has since said she does \"not plan to be involved in politics\" because she wants to prioritize her children and \"the private life we are creating as a family.\"\n\nShe previously served as an executive at the Trump Organization and appeared on Donald Trump's reality TV show, \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nAs part of New York Attorney General Letitia James' investigation into the Trump Organization, Ivanka Trump testified about the company's business practices.\n\nJared Kushner is married to Ivanka Trump and was in her father's closest circle of White House aides, Business Insider writes.\n\nThe publication pointed out that while Kushner's family has a background in Democratic politics, like the former Republican president, they made their money in real estate. A former owner of the \"New York Observer,\" Kushner took over the family's real estate company when his father, Charles, was convicted in 2005 of filing false tax returns, retaliating against a cooperating witness and making false statements to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nDonald Trump later pardoned Charles Kushner in 2020.\n\nAfter serving in Trump's administration, Kushner founded the investment firm Affinity Partners.\n\nDonald Trump's youngest daughter and only child with ex-wife Marla Maples, Tiffany Trump, went to the University of Pennsylvania before getting a law degree from Georgetown.\n\nTiffany Trump married Michael Boulous two years ago.\n\nTiffany Trump's mother, Marla Maples, is Donald Trump's ex-wife. The two met in 1984, and the year after, Maples moved to New York to be a model and actor.\n\nMaples told The Evening Standard in a recent interview that she has never been a fan of politics but found herself \"in the throes of it\" when her ex-husband ran for president.\n\n\"My role was to give Tiffany strength,\" Maples, now a \"spirituality and wellness advocate\" running marlamaples.com, said.\n\nNow, though, The Evening Standard reports that Maples wants to \"join the frontline.\"\n\n\"I'm ready. I am available if needed, and I'm not sitting back anymore,\" she said. \"I want to step out more, share more and not be afraid of positive or negative outcomes that come from speaking out.\"\n\nLara Trump is the Republican National Convention's co-chair. She's been married to Eric Trump since November 8, 2014, with whom she has two children.\n\nIn her earlier years, she worked for Inside Edition and was a contributor to Fox News.\n\nMost recently, Lara Trump spoke at the RNC on Tuesday. While she initially had a \"very different\" speech planned, Lara Trump said to CBS News that she rewrote it in light of the assassination attempt on the former president.\n\nIn her interview with the news outlet, Lara Trump said her focus is \"on this election right now to get my father-in-law reelected.\"\n\n\"And then you never know,\" she added. \"Never say never with Trump.\"\n\nKai Trump, Donald Trump's eldest grandchild, made her first foray into the political arena when she made a speech at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm speaking today to share the side of my grandpa that people don't often see. To me, he's just a normal grandpa,\" Kai Trump said, according to NewsNation partner The Hill. \"He gives us candy and soda when our parents aren't looking.

Usha Vance was also pictured stood with Melania, alongside the president's daughter Ivanka, and son Eric.\n\nThe former first lady was not mentioned on the list of speakers at the RNC for Thursday.\n\nSpeculation about Melania's whereabouts have swirled for days, and she has yet to be pictured at the convention which has been running since Monday. Other members of the Trump family have been pictured on the convention floor, and in the box with their father.\n\nHer appearance in Milwaukee marks her first major political appearance with Trump since he announced his 2024 campaign almost two years ago. Sources told Politico that the former first lady, who is a deeply private person, was deeply shaken by the shocking assassination attempt.\n\nShortly following the incident on Saturday during a campaign rally in Butler Pennsylvania, Melania released a statement in which she described would-be-assassin as a \"monster.\"\n\n\"When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change.

Vance as his running mate, a new addition to the inner circle.\n\n\"He couldn't choose one of his sons or daughters or daughter-in-law, that just wouldn't work, of course,\" Natasha Lindstaedt, a political scientist at the University of Essex, told AFP.\n\n\"J.D. Vance and Don Jr. are very close. So he chose someone that maybe reminds him of his son or is close to his son,\" she said.\n\nA notable absence on the campaign trail this year, however, has been former first lady Melania Trump, who has been all but invisible throughout Trump's rallies and protracted court appearances.\n\n- Where is Melania? -\n\nIn a marked break from precedent, Melania has been largely absent in recent months from her husband's political life, with the notable exception of a fiery statement after an attempted assassination attempt on him on Saturday.\n\nPrior to that, however, she had spoken sparingly and not accompanied her husband during court appearances in a case that saw him convicted of covering up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had a sexual encounter with the real estate tycoon.\n\n\"She's a complete enigma,\" Lindstaedt said, adding that the former model did not \"play the typical role\" of a former first lady.\n\n\"Although she seemed to share similar views to Trump on a lot of issues, not on all, but on a lot of issues, she has a very conservative world view, she doesn't seem to care that much what people think and kind of does her own thing.\"\n\n- Three generations -\n\nThe rest of Trump's family has offered the former president a way to soften his image in the aftermath of the recent convictions and other legal woes.\n\nHis eldest granddaughter, 17-year-old Kai Trump, spoke at the RNC Wednesday night to describe the \"very caring and loving\" patriarch.\n\n\"He's just a normal grandpa, he gives us candy and soda when our parents aren't looking,\" she said.\n\nThe teenage daughter of Donald Jr. spoke of their shared love of golf, even when the former president tries to psych her out when playing against her.\n\n\"I don't let him get to me, but I have to remind him I'm a Trump, too,\" she said.\n\n- Nepotism -\n\nLike wagons hitched to their father's train, Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka have been pulled along to success, along with their friends and families.\n\nLindstaedt pointed to two examples of Trump spouses achieving power: Eric Trump's wife Lara Trump, who was recently appointed co-chair of the Republican National Committee, and Ivanka's husband Jared Kushner, who Trump appointed as an advisor and entrusted with figuring out peace in the Middle East.\n\n\"Suddenly people who have no expertise, no training, no ethics training, maybe they're not even going properly through security clearances, are given access to the most powerful positions,\" Lindstaedt said.\n\n\"And we see when this happens in non-democracies and the dictatorships, how it usually goes very badly.\"\n\nNatalie Koch, who researches geopolitics and authoritarianism at Syracuse University, said Trump's nepotism is nothing new.\n\n\"The Trump organization is a family business, but once he took office the first time, and then you could really see that he brought that into the political realm and into the White House,\" Koch told AFP.\n\n- Children's roles -\n\nEach of Trump's children has been entrusted with different duties during this campaign.\n\nDon Jr., the eldest at age 46, is a big proponent of his father's far-right \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA) ideology.\n\nSpeaking at the Republican National Convention, he extolled the image of his father raising his fist after the assassination attempt last weekend.\n\nIvanka, 42, had played a role in Trump's administration but has since devoted herself to personal matters.\n\nEric, 40, has doubled down on Trump's claims that the 2020 election was rigged. At the convention, he appeared with delegates from Florida and claimed -- without evidence -- that the Democratic Party was planning to win this year's election fraudulently.\n\nTrump's fourth child, Tiffany, 30, was also in attendance at the Republican National Convention.\n\nHis youngest child, 18-year-old Barron, whom he had with current wife Melania, appears to take after his mother's preference for the background, declining to be a delegate from Florida at the convention this year.\n\nmav/llu/jgc/aha/acb\n\nMore from this section\n\nLenderLogix Q2 2024 Homebuyer Intelligence Report Data Shows Home Buying Activity and Fees Collected by Fee Chaser Remain Steady Thus Far in 2024\n\nHow to Unlock a Disabled iPhone without iTunes?

She was seated behind her father.\n\nShe also joined him earlier when he signed the paperwork to be the party's official nominee. She wore a white Versace suit with Jimmy Choo shoes and a Manolo clutch.\n\nThe former first daughter was spotted boarding Trump Force One in Newark, N.J., on Thursday night for the flight to Milwaukee along with husband Jared Kushner and Melania Trump.\n\nIvanka Trump watches father Donald Trump at the convention\n\nIvanka Trump said a few months ago she would attend the convention in her 'personal capacity' to watch her father accept the party's nomination. She will not address the delegates.\n\nShe and her dad are extremely close. But Thursday's appearance is the first time she joined him for a campaign appearance in his 2024 election bid.\n\nAnd she was at her father's side after the horrific attempt on his life.\n\nThe former first daughter met Donald Trump upon his arrival in Bedminster, N.J., on Saturday night after the attempted assassination. She also spoke with him on the phone while he was in the hospital on Saturday night, sources close to the campaign told DailyMail.com.\n\nAfter the horrific attempt on her father's life, Ivanka took to social media to thank supporters and said she was 'praying for America' after the act of 'senseless violence'.\n\nShe also thanked the Secret Service for their response in taking down the gunman.\n\n'I love you Dad, today and always,' the former First Daughter wrote on X.\n\nIvanka added: 'Thank you for your love and prayers for my father and for the other victims of today's senseless violence in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n'I am grateful to the Secret Service and all the other law enforcement officers for their quick and decisive actions today. I continue to pray for our country.'\n\nShe also said she believed her mom Ivana was watching over her father.\n\n'Two years ago today, my mom passed away. I believe she was watching over Dad last night during the attempt on his life. I miss her every day and pray for the safety of the family and friends she left behind,' Ivanka noted Sunday morning on social media.\n\nBut while she has supported her father's goal to return to the White House, she is doing so from behind the scenes.\n\nIvanka's decision is in stark contrast to the 2020 election when she introduced her father at that year's convention. She was also heavily involved in the 2016 convention.\n\nBut she has done a 180 on politics since Donald Trump lost that contest.\n\nIvanka opened up about her decision to leave politics in a rare interview. In an hour-long interview with Lex Fridman, she said she wanted to spend more time with her three children and, after four years of serving in her father's White House, felt like she 'left it all on the field.'\n\n'I spent four years in Washington. I feel like I left it all on the field. I feel really good about it and I feel really privileged to have been able to do what I did,' she said.\n\nShe said, however, she is father's top supporter, as the former president battles multiple legal cases.\n\n'On a human level, it's my father and I love him very much, so it's painful to experience, but ultimately, I wish it didn't have to be this way,' she said.\n\nIvanka was a senior advisor in Trump's administration from 2017 until 2021, but she has not been heavily involved in his second bid for the White House.\n\nFormer President and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (L) stands with Co-chair of the Republican National Committee Lara Trump (R), (from top L) daughter Ivanka Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos\n\nAs Usha Chilukuri Vance, Ivanka Trump former first lady Melania Trump and Eric Trump watch, Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, sign paperwork to officially accept the nomination\n\nWhen Donald Trump announced his bid for re-election last year, Ivanka said in a statement posted to social media that she loved her father but would be staying out of politics. She was not at his announcement speech. Nor did she attend the first presidential debate.\n\n'I love my father very much. This time around, I'm choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family,' the former White House adviser said. 'While I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena,' she said at the time.\n\nShe also was one of the few family members who didn't join him at his trial in New York earlier this year, when the former president was being prosecuted over hush-money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\n'It was a decision rooted in me being a parent, really thinking about what they need from me now. Politics is a rough business and I think it's one that you also can't dabble in, I think you have to be either all in or all out.'\n\nIvanka referenced 'the cost' her children would pay from her absence were she to go all in on the campaign trail, adding 'I'm not willing to make them bear that cost.'\n\n'As their mom, I think it's really important that I do what's right for them. I think there a lot of ways you can serve, the enormity, the scale of what can be accomplished in government service, but I think there's something equally valuable in helping in your own community.'\n\nShe said there was 'a lot of darkness, a lot of negativity' in politics and says it's the opposite of 'what feels good for me as a human being.'\n\nIvanka and husband Jared Kushner have worked to distance themselves from the tumultuous world of politics amid Donald Trump's re-election campaign and his various legal woes.\n\nThey relocated to Florida with children Arabella, 12, Joseph, 9, and Theodore, 8, after Trump left office in January 2021.\n\nIvanka has been focused on charity work and reconnecting with her old friends since leaving the White House.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Kushner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jared Kushner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Her presumed upcoming appearance at the RNC will be one of her rare public engagements this election cycle, although she is not expected to speak at the event.\n\nNeither Melania nor Donald Trump's spokespeople immediately responded to Newsweek's requests for comment.\n\nMelania's last public appearance was in June when she was spotted arriving at Trump Tower after her husband left for a rally in Milwaukee. She did not join her husband at the rally, and was instead seen in New York City according to photos published by Page Six.\n\nShe most recently spoke out after her husband was shot in the ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. In a statement posted to social media, she said: \"When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change.\"\n\nLater in the press release, she added: \"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music and inspiration.

Amid a turbulent period that saw the death of her mother and her son, Barron, leave for college, many had speculated that Melania had withdrawn her support from her husband's political endeavors.\n\nHowever, the close call in Pennsylvania appears to have prompted Melania's reemergence, as Trump pushes for a second term in the White House. Although Melania declined to speak at the RNC event, her presence was viewed as a powerful statement and an indication of a potential shift in her stance towards her husband's political aspirations.\n\nMelania's behavior stands in stark contrast to that of her counterpart, Jill Biden, who has been a constant presence by her husband's side throughout his political career. By comparison, Melania has been characterized as a \"very private person\" who has expressed a distaste for the Washington social-political scene.\n\nMelania has not commented on her decision to shield herself from the public eye. Her absence from the Daniels trial, where a series of Republican lawmakers, former administration officials, and even some of Trump's own children lent their support, was seen as a huge blow to Trump's defense. Legal experts noted that the presence of a defendant's spouse in the courtroom can often humanize the client and sway the jury.\n\nWashington Post associate editor Mary Jordan wrote a book about Melania in which she put it, \"Melania does what Melania wants.\"\n\nMelania's presence on stage signaled an end to her prolonged absence from the public eye, but it remains to be seen whether her appearance was any more than a one-off.\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply Read more about: Donald Trump Melania Trump", "source": {"uri": "uinterview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "uInterview"}, "authors": [{"uri": "baila_eve_zisman@uinterview.com", "name": "Baila Eve Zisman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Republican-presidential-nominee-former-U.S.-President-Donald-Trump-kisses-former-first-lady-Melania-Trump-c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

She seemed as inscrutable and distant as ever.\n\nEver since her husband was first elected in 2016, Melania Trump has broken all the rules of normal American presidential politics.\n\nIn the White House during Trump's first term, she was a reclusive figure compared to other first ladies, focusing on a narrow set of interests. The US national archives descibes her as having been an \"ambassador for kindness\" and an advocate for children's issues.\n\nAnd since her husband left office, she has refused to be seen by her husband's side on many occasions when the public would expect her to be present.\n\nShe wasn't there when he had his mugshot taken in Atlanta. She wasn't there in New York when he became the first former president to be convicted of a crime. And she wasn't there when he officially won his party's presidential nomination, for the third time, on Monday.\n\n\"Melania does what Melania wants,\" said Mary Jordan, who wrote The Art of her Deal, a biography on the former first lady. \"She is fiercely independent and won't do something just because other people do it. She doesn't feel any obligation to do it.\"\n\nWe are now all accustomed to the fact that she doesn't turn up at many of Donald Trump's events, but on Monday, when he walked into the arena here in Milwaukee to a roaring welcome, greeted like a Messiah after his survival of the assassination attempt, her absence felt particularly obvious.\n\nIt was certainly noticed by the Republicans gathered here, but that didn't mean they weren't excited for her appearance, when it finally came.\n\nMelania is the most enigmatic first lady in modern history and we rarely hear what she thinks.\n\nAn exception was the lengthy statement she released after the shooting targeting her husband, which read as though she may have dictated it directly.\n\n\"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,\" she said.\n\n\"The core facets of my husband's life - his human side - were buried below the political machine. Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times.\"\n\nIt is traditional at party conventions for the candidate's spouse to give a speech and tell heavily-scripted anecdotes about family life.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Usha Vance - the wife of Trump's newly-minted running mate JD Vance - did just that. She called her husband a \"meat and potatoes\" man, but - in an apparent sign of his devotion - said he now cooked her Indian vegetarian food.\n\nAnd while Donald Trump's oldest son Don Jr, middle son Eric, daughter-in-law Lara and granddaughter Kai have all spoken at this convention, Melania has declined the opportunity to speak. She very clearly does not do anything she does not want to do.\n\nWhen she did introduce her husband at the 2016 convention when he first ran for president - things went horribly wrong.\n\nShe was criticised for plagiarising the speech Michelle Obama gave in 2008 when she introduced her husband Barack at the Democratic convention. Melania's speechwriter later accepted the blame.\n\nFirst ladies are always heavily scrutinised for the image they project, the causes they adopt, and the clothes they wear.\n\nBut Melania Trump is the first who was previously a professional model. She looks fabulous in photographs and is well aware of the power of her image. By offering so few photo opportunities, she makes each one infinitely more powerful.\n\n\"She is very savvy and has cultivated the mystery woman mystique by going underground and then when she does come out, it's a much bigger deal,\" says Ms Jordan.\n\n\"She doesn't appear very often, but she does show up when Donald Trump really needs her.\"\n\nAfter Saturday's attempt on his life, Melania felt MIA. But on Thursday night, as she slowly walked the stairs to the VIP section, paused at the top and waved to all corners of the arena, she showed her mastery of the power of an image.", "source": {"uri":

Tiffany, who was still beaming, reached over to touch Trump's chest and seemed to be trying to give him a side kiss. However, she failed in her attempt and kissed the air instead.\n\nTiffany then turned and walked back to her seat without responding. Her spouse, Michael Boulos, trailed behind her and it seems Trump did not meet him either.\n\nThe Recount posted the video on X with the caption, \"Trump snubs his daughter Tiffany as she goes in for a kiss.\" It has garnered over 2.2 million views so far.\n\nReacting to the video, one X user wrote: \"Should have seen her moments ago when she was left out of the conversations going on between the family members, Vance, and others.\"\n\n\"He might not remember who it is,\" another user reacted.\n\n\"Her mistake was to go to the convention,\" a third user chimed in.\n\nTiffany Trump is daughter of Donald Trump and Marla Maples, to whom the former president was married between 1993 and 1999.

Trump's daughter-in-law, delivered a keynote address. Her husband, Eric, has made the rounds on cable news. Another Trump son, Donald Trump Jr., spoke for 19 minutes on Wednesday night, long enough even to hand the mic to his teenage daughter, Kai.\n\nAnd yet, where is Melania?\n\nDonald Trump's wife has remained out of sight. She has not been in the V.I.P. box where Mr. Trump has presided over the prime-time show each night. She has not been on television. She is sparsely featured in the videos played for delegates between speakers and in the photos plastered on the arena's walls.\n\nMrs. Trump is set to appear on Thursday, as her husband delivers his acceptance speech on the convention's final night. But, in a break from tradition, she is not expected to speak. (Other Trumps are likely to make their first appearances, too: Ivanka, the former president's daughter who is keeping a distance from his current campaign, and Barron, 18, Mr. Trump's youngest son.)\n\nAt this celebration of all things Trump, nobody knows quite what to make of this.\n\nScott Walker, the former governor of Wisconsin, speculated on Wednesday from the floor of the convention hall that it is probably just \"too overwhelming\" for Mrs. Trump, given the assassination attempt on her husband on Saturday. \"I think it's going to be emotional even to be with him,\" Mr. Walker said, \"let alone speak.\"\n\nAsked about the former first lady on Tuesday, Matt Schlapp, a former White House aide, shrugged. \"I don't know whether she's coming or not,\" he said. \"Melania has always taken full measure of her ability to have private time for as long as possible. I know that she's completely behind this campaign.\"\n\nMrs. Trump has been disappearing from view for a while now.

Spouses of presidential hopefuls traditionally address the RNC crowd; Melania herself took the stage in both the 2016 and 2020 conventions, where her speeches bore striking resemblances to those of former first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nThis appearance follows shortly after Melania's public statement regarding the assassination attempt on Donald Trump last Saturday at a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania. \"When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realised my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change,\" she said in her statement.\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump's assassination attempt was 'top of Putin's wishlist' as US hit by 'political chaos'\n\nThe final day of the conference has seen a wide variety of speakers, from the general manager of Trump's golf resorts to former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan, who shredded his shirt in front of attendees as he shared his passion for \"Trumpmania.\"\n\nFormer first lady Melania Trump was cheered loudly when mentioned by other speakers during the previous nights, but she finally entered the arena on the final night wearing a red jacket and pencil skirt suit and waving to the crowds.\n\nMelania has been conspicuously absent from the ex-president's campaign trail, reports the Mirror US.\n\nThe former First Lady appeared dressed all in red as she walked into the Milwaukee convention hall, shortly before her husband took to the stage. The speech marks his first public comments since a 20-year-old with a rifle tried to shoot him at a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday.\n\nShe will not be speaking at the convention. Her office was the one that declined an invitation for Barron Trump to appear as a Florida delegate after the state's Republican party chose him to join the delegation saying the couple's youngest son had \"prior commitments.\"\n\nHer presence helps the Republican party show unity, a theme that has emerged more prominently after the attempt on Trump's life.

On Jan. 25, 2025, the former first couple will toast 20 years of marriage.\n\nTwenty years ago, Donald Trump and then-fianc\u00e9 Melania Knauss, her professional modeling name, were busy planning their lavish nuptials in Palm Beach, Florida - the wedding at Bethesda-By-the-Sea Episcopal Church, followed by a wedding reception in the new Donald J. Trump Ballroom at his private club.\n\nMuch has happened since the Trumps tied the knot; his third trip down the aisle and her first:\n\nAnd a lot has happened to the wedding venue Mar-a-Lago since 2005: Several Trump family members were married or hosted wedding receptions there. Ahead of the milestone wedding anniversary of Donald and Melania Trump, here's a look at who (and who didn't) include Trump's private club Mar-a-Lago in their wedding nuptials.\n\nWhat was Melania Trump's maiden name?\n\nMelania Trump was born Melanija Knavs April 26, 1970, in Novo Mesto, Slovenia, according to her bio on the White House Historical Association's website. As Melania Knauss, she began her modeling career at age 16 and moved to New York in 1996. Donald Trump met the model in 1998 at a New York fashion party, became engaged in 2004 and married in 2005.\n\nTwenty years ago, Melania Knauss was just a bride-to-be, squeezing in wedding dress fittings, finalizing celebrity invites and reception dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Melania Knauss became Mrs. Donald Trump on a Saturday evening in January 2005.\n\nPhotos looking back at the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump\n\nThe photo gallery below is a look back at wedding preparations for Donald and Melania Trump and what we know about their Jan. 25, 2005, wedding, from archived photos and coverage of the Palm Beach Post, the Palm Beach Daily News and USA TODAY Network-Florida.\n\nWhere did Donald Trump Jr. get married?\n\nOn Nov. 12, 2005, Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of Donald Trump and first wife Ivana Trump, married former model Vanessa Kay Trump, formerly Vanessa Kay Pergolizzi. Donald Trump introduced Donald Trump Jr. to Vanessa at a fashion show in 2003. The couple married at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach in front of about 370 guests, reports show, with the service officiated by Donald Trump's sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry. Donald Trump Jr. and Vanessa Trump were 27 years old when they wed, weeks before they both turned 28 in December 2005.\n\nDonald Trump Jr.'s siblings were in the wedding party: Ivanka Trump was a bridesmaid, and Eric Trump was a groomsman.\n\nVanessa and Donald Trump Jr. had five children together - Kai Trump, Donald Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump and Chloe Trump - before they eventually divorced, after 12 years of marriage, in 2018.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. is engaged to Kimberly Guilfoyle.\n\nWhere did Eric Trump and Lara Trump get married?\n\nOn Nov. 8, 2014, after a six-year relationship, Lara Yunaska married Eric Trump in a ceremony at Mar-a-Lago. Eric Trump, then 30 and son of Donald Trump and his first wife, Ivana Trump, married the TV producer in a ceremony that included 450 guests and was held on the lawn of the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, USA TODAY reports in a November 2014 story.\n\nWedding guests included Eric Trump's mom Ivana Trump, radio personality Elvis Duran and former \"Real Housewives of New York\" star Jill Zarin, according to People magazine.\n\nThe family of Eric Trump's sister, Ivanka Trump, had roles in the wedding: Ivanka Trump's daughter was a flower girl and Ivanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, officiated at the wedding, according to the Daily News. The Daily Mail reports that Lara Trump's dog, Charlie, was the ring bearer.\n\nTwo weeks before her wedding to Eric Trump, the bride, Lara Yunaska, broke both of her wrists in a horse riding accident. She chose to wear Vera Wang -- one gown for the ceremony and another for the reception.\n\nWhere did Ivanka Trump marry Jared Kushner?\n\nOn Oct. 25, 2009, Ivanka Trump, eldest daughter of Donald and Ivana Trump, married Jared Kushner, who previously owned the New York Observer. The 27-year-old bride and 28-year-old groom tied the knot at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, in front of about 500 guests.\n\nNews reports show the guest list included celebrities such as Russell Crowe, Regis Philbin, Natalie Portman, Barbara Walters, Rudy Giuliani, Andrew Cuomo, country singer Jamey Johnson, Emmy Rossum and then-boyfriend Adam Duritz of the band Counting Crows.\n\nIvanka Trump wore a Vera Wang gown reminiscent of Princess Grace Kelly's wedding dress. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are parents to three children, Arabella Rose Kushner, Joseph Frederick Kushner and Theodore James Kushner.\n\nWhere did Tiffany Trump get married?\n\nOn Nov. 12, 2022, Tiffany Trump and Michael Boulos were married at Donald Trump's private club Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. More than 500 guests attended the wedding of the former president's youngest daughter, then 29, to the 25-year-old Lebanese-American billionaire. Tiffany Trump is the younger daughter of the former president and his second wife Marla Maples.\n\nThe couple, who got engaged after two years of dating, met in 2018, when Boulos was studying project management at City University of London and Tiffany Trump was a law student at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Both were vacationing in Santorini and met in Mykonos at Lindsay Lohan's Beach Club, according to People magazine.\n\nTiffany Trump announced her engagement to Boulos on her father's last day in office; her fiance proposed in the White House Rose Garden. In an homage to her husband's Lebanese heritage, the bride chose Lebanese designer Elie Saab to design her dress, according to the Palm Beach Daily News.\n\nThree days before the wedding, Florida was in the path of Hurricane Nicole. The wedding occurred without issue from the storm.\n\nThey do!

While Jill Biden, America's current First Lady, goes around fiercely defending her doddery husband and congratulating him on managing to answer \"every question\" as if he were a three-year-old child, the previous -- and likely, for her sins, returning -- Flotus doesn't even show up to stand by her husband's side two days after a bullet intended to assassinate him blew off part of his ear.\n\nDonald Trump seemed unusually subdued and emotional on Monday night when he made his first public appearance since the shooting at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. His eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, appeared to have tears in his eyes as the former president walked out alone into the auditorium to the rousing sound of God Bless the USA, a large white bandage covering most of his right ear. Eric was there to support his father too, while youngest daughter Tiffany turned up to do her usual vacant smiling.\n\nBut Melania, in trademark DGAF style, was nowhere to be seen. On Tuesday evening, it was Trump's daughter-in-law Lara who talked of the horror of watching \"someone try to kill a person you love\", in the RNC slot usually reserved for the wife of the presidential nominee.\n\nThe only words Melania has so far uttered on the subject of the violent attempt on her husband's life have been via a written statement shared on social media -- one that had a distinct whiff of the ChatGPT (not to mention the Google Translate) about it.\n\n\"A monster who recognised my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion -- his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,\" the statement read. \"Our personal, structural and life commitment -- until death -- is at serious risk.\"\n\nWell, the sentiment is there, and I liked it, personally. You might have supposed Melania would have a member of staff look over the statement before making it public. But to suppose, when it comes to Melania Trump, is to make a grave error. It takes a certain kind of woman to keep a man like Donald Trump on his toes, after all. And she has done so for more than 20 years, by virtue of a mystique that swings wildly between the bizarre and the brazen.\n\nMelania clings to the faux pas as if it were her favourite Herm\u00e8s bag. Who could forget her 2016 speech at the RNC, which cribbed large chunks of Michelle Obama's 2008 address to the Democratic convention (her speechwriter later took responsibility for this)? Or the time, later that year, that she turned up to a presidential debate wearing a bright pink pussy-bow blouse just two days after audio had been released of her husband boasting of how he likes to \"grab 'em by the pussy\"?\n\nThe vestiary reference was, reportedly, \"not intentional\". Neither, presumably, was the pattern of the stitching on the coat she wore for a tribute to 9/11 in 2019, which oddly resembled a plane crashing into one of the Twin Towers (a spokeswoman called the suggestion \"ridiculous\").\n\nBut the time she set off for the detention centre for migrant children wearing a $39 Zara jacket emblazoned with the words \"I REALLY DON'T CARE DO U?\" -- that was deliberate. She said in an interview in 2018 that the message was intended not for the migrant children, but for \"the people and for the leftwing media who are criticising me. And I want to show them that I don't care.\"\n\nThe leftwing media are not the only ones in Melania's firing line; virtually every anecdote Trump shares about his wife seems to be some account of her negging him. When he was complaining that the lighting was too bright at a rally last year, Trump told the crowd: \"When you go home to watch it with our great First Lady, how did I look? She said: you didn't look good!\" In a different speech, Trump admitted that \"she doesn't like when I dance a little bit to the music.\"\n\nMelania has shown up to none of Trump's recent court appearances, and virtually none of his campaign events. I've lost track of the number of times I've seen her turn her head when her husband tries to kiss her, or that her facial expression has given away her lack of interest in one of the rare appearances she has deigned to make. The only person who can drop a smile more quickly is Kanye West.\n\nGiven the comments he has made about women and the number of sexual assault allegations that have been made about him -- not to mention his unfaithfulness -- you might have supposed Trump would choose as his wife a submissive type. But again, you would be wrong. Trump, clearly, is someone to whom the \"treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen\" rule applies.\n\nWhen I was lunching on the patio at Mar-a-Lago in February, as one does, Melania walked by to get to the spa -- the only route from her living quarters -- in a full face of make-up, her hair freshly blow-dried. What a chore, I thought, to constantly have to be so aware of your appearance. But I did not pity her. \"People think and talk about me like: Oh, Melania, oh poor Melania. Don't feel sorry for me,\" she once said -- rather threateningly, I fancied. I wouldn't dare.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person",

She seemed as inscrutable and distant as ever.\n\nEver since her husband was first elected in 2016, Melania Trump has broken all the rules of normal American presidential politics.\n\nIn the White House during Trump's first term, she was a reclusive figure compared to other first ladies, focusing on a narrow set of interests. The US national archives descibes her as having been an \"ambassador for kindness\" and an advocate for children's issues.\n\nAnd since her husband left office, she has refused to be seen by her husband's side on many occasions when the public would expect her to be present.\n\nShe wasn't there when he had his mugshot taken in Atlanta. She wasn't there in New York when he became the first former president to be convicted of a crime. And she wasn't there when he officially won his party's presidential nomination, for the third time, on Monday.\n\n\"Melania does what Melania wants,\" said Mary Jordan, who wrote The Art of her Deal, a biography on the former first lady. \"She is fiercely independent and won't do something just because other people do it. She doesn't feel any obligation to do it.\"\n\nWe are now all accustomed to the fact that she doesn't turn up at many of Donald Trump's events, but on Monday, when he walked into the arena here in Milwaukee to a roaring welcome, greeted like a Messiah after his survival of the assassination attempt, her absence felt particularly obvious.\n\nIt was certainly noticed by the Republicans gathered here, but that didn't mean they weren't excited for her appearance, when it finally came.\n\nMelania is the most enigmatic first lady in modern history and we rarely hear what she thinks.\n\nAn exception was the lengthy statement she released after the shooting targeting her husband, which read as though she may have dictated it directly.\n\n\"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,\" she said.\n\n\"The core facets of my husband's life - his human side - were buried below the political machine. Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times.\"\n\nIt is traditional at party conventions for the candidate's spouse to give a speech and tell heavily-scripted anecdotes about family life.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Usha Vance - the wife of Trump's newly-minted running mate JD Vance - did just that. She called her husband a \"meat and potatoes\" man, but - in an apparent sign of his devotion - said he now cooked her Indian vegetarian food.\n\nAnd while Donald Trump's oldest son Don Jr, middle son Eric, daughter-in-law Lara and granddaughter Kai have all spoken at this convention, Melania has declined the opportunity to speak. She very clearly does not do anything she does not want to do.\n\nWhen she did introduce her husband at the 2016 convention when he first ran for president - things went horribly wrong.\n\nShe was criticised for plagiarising the speech Michelle Obama gave in 2008 when she introduced her husband Barack at the Democratic convention. Melania's speechwriter later accepted the blame.\n\nFirst ladies are always heavily scrutinised for the image they project, the causes they adopt, and the clothes they wear.\n\nBut Melania Trump is the first who was previously a professional model. She looks fabulous in photographs and is well aware of the power of her image. By offering so few photo opportunities, she makes each one infinitely more powerful.\n\n\"She is very savvy and has cultivated the mystery woman mystique by going underground and then when she does come out, it's a much bigger deal,\" says Ms Jordan.\n\n\"She doesn't appear very often, but she does show up when Donald Trump really needs her.\"\n\nAfter Saturday's attempt on his life, Melania felt MIA. But on Thursday night, as she slowly walked the stairs to the VIP section, paused at the top and waved to all corners of the arena, she showed her mastery of the power of an image.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classical music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Messiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speechwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speechwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_in_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missing in action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Potato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegetarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/4467a21cb54753dcb9a6d01b1eff890a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Her silence highlights how she has significantly reshaped the role of first lady.\n\nA year ago this spring, when the 2024 presidential campaign was just kicking off, it seemed evident that Melania Trump, wife of former President Donald Trump, had decided to give it a miss. Little has changed since then. Her continued detachment from campaign events and rallies, her absence in all the primaries save Florida's (where she voted), her skipping her husband's lengthy hush money trial and his June 28 debate against President Joe Biden come alongside the strong speculation that she won't live full-time in the White House again should Trump be re-elected.\n\nAll of it taken together seems only to confirm that her distance from Trump's political life will continue no matter what happens Nov. 5. Melania Trump has, it is true, held two campaign fundraisers for the Log Cabin Republicans at her homes; but by contrast, first lady Jill Biden has held frequent fundraising tours with multiple destinations.\n\nJill Biden, described as \"defender-in-chief\" of her husband's campaign by the Economist, and described by The New York Times as \"comforter-in-chief\" to some jittery Democrats, has visited red states and blue ones, often alone, and been an actively political surrogate for her husband. Melania Trump's limited appearances could not be in starker contrast.\n\nThough she has been harder to find, Melania Trump is planning to attend the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. However, unlike she did in 2016 and 2020, this time she does not plan to speak. Her silence will end an unbroken tradition that goes back to Barbara Bush in 1992 of first ladies and candidates' spouses giving significant addresses at conventions.\n\nAs long as she is visible at the convention, even if she's silent, Melania Trump will win plaudits from Trump fans, many of whom only want more of her. Still, her silence and her rare appearances are further evidence, as Katie Rogers noted recently, that Melania Trump has significantly reshaped the role of first lady: \"She broke open the role and actually showed us [that] you don't have to do anything with it if you don't want to.\"\n\nFor more than a century, whether they desired it or not, first ladies have been highly visible campaigners. As many American women got to vote for the first time in 1920, for example, Florence Harding eagerly stood on her front porch, in what was called the Front Porch Campaign, hosting tens of thousands of visitors alongside her husband, President Warren G. Harding. Similarly, Eleanor Roosevelt called for Franklin D. Roosevelt's unprecedented third term during her \"no ordinary time\" speech at the Democratic convention in 1940, a step that, as First Ladies Association for Research and Education President Nancy Kegan Smith notes, \"was credited with helping FDR to unify the convention.\"\n\nTwo decades later, Lady Bird Johnson was the first to take to the hustings on her own, with the whistle-stop tour in 1964 -- a bold venture into a hostile South that helped bring about LBJ's victory. Pat Nixon was the next to appear at a convention, in 1972, thrilled to offer remarks about her husband, Richard Nixon, following an eight-minute standing ovation. Then in 1992, Barbara Bush, already known for a significant speech at Wellesley College, had the opportunity to speak \"about the centrality of family ... in a model of conciliatory rhetoric,\" as scholar Myra Gutin explains.\n\nSince then, first ladies' speeches at conventions have often focused on family matters; Hillary Clinton spoke of children and family in 1996, as did Michelle Obama in 2008: \"I come here as a wife; I come here as a mom.\" In 2012, Michelle Obama further highlighted hers and President Barack Obama's humble family histories. In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, Jill Biden offered a speech \"as a mother and a grandmother\" from a classroom at a high school where she once taught. Both Melania Trump's speeches in 2016 and 2020 were similarly focused on family, addressing mothers like herself -- and women as a whole.\n\nThis theme of family was also echoed by Melania Trump this past weekend in the wake of the assassination attempt on her husband. In an effort to reach across the aisle, she pointed out that \"every single politician is a man or a woman with a loving family.\" Her statement was heartfelt and empathic, calling for Americans to see each other as \"human beings.\" Considering her absence during so much of the campaign so far, her outspokenness at this moment was notable -- and will likely carry significant political weight. Her comments, of course, stand in stark contrast to the way her husband told supporters to \"fight like hell\" right before the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nMelania Trump's words were important in humanizing her husband, and they suggest that GOP strategist Alex Conant is overlooking something significant when he claims that \"people vote for the presidential candidate, not their spouse or their vice president.\" This is because for more than a century now, whether they are particularly interested in politicking or not, first ladies have served their spouses' campaigns immeasurably, by humanizing and broadening their appeal. With her statement, Melania Trump did just that after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. And Jill Biden's call to her in the wake of the attack underlined the sisterhood of first ladies, all of whom know that what happened Saturday is what each of them dreads the most.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_Cabin_Republicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Log Cabin Republicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbara Bush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red states and blue states"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

He is now engaged to Kimberly Guilfoyle.\n\nLike his brother, Eric Trump, the third of the former president's children, has reportedly lobbied his father on issues that matter to him.\n\nHe has maintained a less public persona than his older brother, but also maintains a prominent presence in the Trump family business.\n\nIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner were arguably the most influential members of the former president's family during Trump's first term in the White House.\n\nThe couple have been married since 2009 and share three children.\n\nDuring the former president's tenure in the White House, Ivanka Trump made numerous appearances on behalf of her father and his administration.\n\nMr. Kushner served as a senior White House adviser from 2017 to 2021.\n\nThe former president's fourth child and Trump's only child born to his second wife, Marla Maples.\n\nShe played no political role in her father's campaigns or during his time in the White House.\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr. have been together for six years and engaged since 2020.\n\nShe was a Fox News anchor from 2006 to 2018, before leaving to become a member of a pro-Trump super PAC.\n\nLike her fianc\u00e9, she has always openly supported the former president, particularly during television appearances.\n\nShe was married to California Governor Gavin Newsom in the early 2000s.\n\nMarried to Eric, she is the rising star of the family, especially since she began serving as RNC co-chair earlier this year. She has two children with Eric.\n\nShe told the convention what the former president was like as a father-in-law.\n\nFormer first lady Melania Trump has been married to Trump since 2005.\n\nShe kept a low profile during Trump's term and has rarely made public appearances since.\n\nAlthough she has hosted Republican fundraisers over the past year, her planned appearance at the RNC this week would be her first major appearance of this election cycle.\n\nBarron Trump made an appearance on the campaign trail earlier this month with his father, but he has largely stayed out of the spotlight.\n\nIn May, it was announced that he would be among the Florida state delegates attending the RNC in July, but a day later his mother said he had declined the offer.\n\nHe graduated in May from Oxbridge Academy in Palm Beach, Florida, and will attend college in the fall, according to Trump. However, the family has not said which school he will attend.\n\nKai Trump is the eldest of Trump's grandchildren and the daughter of Donald Trump Jr. and his ex-wife Vanessa Trump.\n\nThe 17-year-old is an avid golfer and spoke at the RNC on Wednesday about what Trump is like as a grandfather.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Guilfoyle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Guilfoyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

She has kept a low profile during her husband's 2024 White House bid. She had not been spotted in Milwaukee since the convention kicked off on Monday.\n\nAlso Read | Elon Musk Again Denies Donating USD 45 Million per Month to Former US President Donald Trump, Provides Details on Matter.\n\nLast week, Melania issued a statement calling for unity following an assassination attempt against Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence. We all want a world where respect is paramount, family is first, and love transcends. We can realise this world again. Each of us must demand to get it back. We must insist that respect fills the cornerstone of our relationships again,\" she said in a statement.\n\nAlso Read | Bangladesh Students Protest: Why Are Student Groups Protesting?

But Melania skipped delivering a speech. Ever since her husband was first elected in 2016, Melania Trump has broken all the rules of normal American presidential politics.\n\nIn the White House during Trump's first term, she was a reclusive figure compared to other first ladies, focusing on a narrow set of interests.\n\nAnd since her husband left office, she has not been seen by her husband's side on many occasions.\n\nShe wasn't there when he had his mugshot taken in Atlanta. She wasn't there in New York when he became the first former president to be convicted of a crime. And she wasn't there when he officially won his party's presidential nomination, for the third time, on Monday.\n\nThe former first lady spoke in both 2020 and 2016 during Trump's presidential nomination. She was accused of borrowing from Michelle Obama's 2008 speech in her first appearance in 2016.\n\n(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Latestly-World-News-784x441.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 17}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Convention", "body": "The Republican National Convention has been chockablock with Trumps.\n\nLara Trump, the co-chair of the Republican Party and Donald J. Trump's daughter-in-law, delivered a keynote address. Her husband, Eric, has made the rounds on cable news. Another Trump son, Donald Trump Jr., spoke for 19 minutes on Wednesday night, long enough even to hand the mic to his teenage daughter, Kai.\n\nAnd yet, where is Melania?\n\nDonald Trump's wife has remained out of sight. She has not been in the V.I.P. box where Mr. Trump has presided over the prime-time show each night. She has not been on television. She is sparsely featured in the videos played for delegates between speakers and in the photos plastered on the arena's walls.\n\nMrs. Trump is set to appear on Thursday, as her husband delivers his acceptance speech on the convention's final night. But, in a break from tradition, she is not expected to speak. (Other Trumps are likely to make their first appearances, too: Ivanka, the former president's daughter who is keeping a distance from his current campaign, and Barron, 18, Mr. Trump's youngest son.)\n\nAt this celebration of all things Trump, nobody knows quite what to make of this.\n\nScott Walker, the former governor of Wisconsin, speculated on Wednesday from the floor of the convention hall that it is probably just \"too overwhelming\" for Mrs. Trump, given the assassination attempt on her husband on Saturday. \"I think it's going to be emotional even to be with him,\" Mr. Walker said, \"let alone speak.\"\n\nAsked about the former first lady on Tuesday, Matt Schlapp, a former White House aide, shrugged. \"I don't know whether she's coming or not,\" he said. \"Melania has always taken full measure of her ability to have private time for as long as possible. I know that she's completely behind this campaign.\"\n\nMrs. Trump has been disappearing from view for a while now. She did not show up at her husband's trial for falsifying business records to cover up hush payments to Stormy Daniels, a porn star who claimed to have had a tryst with Mr. Trump while his wife was home with a newborn. So far in this campaign, Mrs. Trump has done two fund-raisers with gay Republicans, but little else.\n\n\"Melania will be out whenever it's appropriate for her,\" Lara Trump said in an interview with The New York Times last week. \"Just because people are not overtly out front with banners or signs or whatever it might be, doesn't mean they are not 100 percent on board.\"\n\nMelania Trump was overtly out front at the last two Republican conventions.\n\nIn 2016, she gave a speech that plagiarized chunks of a Michelle Obama speech. In 2020, when the country was being rocked by Covid-19 and unrest after the death of George Floyd, Mrs. Trump delivered a speech from the Rose Garden that was seen as more compassionate than anything at that convention. \"I know many people are anxious and some feel helpless,\" she said then. \"I want you to know that you are not alone.\"\n\nOrdinarily, wives play a central role at these conventions, humanizing their spouse. Mr. Trump has relied on his son's wife and former aides to do that this time around.\n\n\"Last night, when we heard Lara, she told us a lot of things that we already knew about Donald, but we didn't know his personal side, his family side, how compassionate he really is,\" a Nebraska delegate, Mary Gerdes, said on Wednesday. Did she think it was odd that the candidate's wife seemed to want nothing to do with this convention? \"It would've been great to hear from her,\" Ms. Gerdes said, \"but she's had a rough week.\"\n\nAfter Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981, Nancy Reagan rushed to the emergency room to be by his side, spending the next 13 days at the hospital with him. (\"Honey, I forgot to duck,\" Mr. Reagan told his wife.)\n\nMr. Trump's wife was not by his side for his first public appearance since the shooting here on Monday. She did put out a letter, though. \"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion,\" she wrote, citing her husband's \"laughter\" and his \"love of music.\"\n\nOn Wednesday night, Mr. Trump chose to walk out onto the convention floor to James Brown's \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" (it was the version featuring Luciano Pavarotti).\n\nThis is a man's world, but it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl.\n\nA little while later, the founder of Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk, watched as Kai Trump spoke onstage. At this introduction of yet another Trump, Mr. Kirk smiled and remarked that \"this political dynasty goes a lot longer than liberals realize.\"\n\nMrs. Trump's role in that dynasty, however, continues to be a mystery. Mr. Kirk, asked if he thought she would join her husband in the White House if he won in November, wouldn't even speculate.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"},

This year, neither made any speeches, the Associated Press reports.\n\nThe entrepreneur took to the stage in a red Dior suit, which she wore in 2017 for an official visit to Paris. The model's stylist Herve Pierre said: \"It's nothing new - it's just a repetition. But she loves this suit. She has nice clothes, so she can repeat [looks].\" Trump complemented her outfit with red Christian Louboutin stiletto heels.\n\nMelania Trump's presence helps the Republican Party demonstrate its overall unity, which is especially emphasized after the assassination attempt on the politician's life. The day after the attack, Melania issued a statement calling on Americans to \"rise above the hate and simple-minded ideas that fuel violence.\"\n\nCampaigns often use spouses and families to humanize a candidate, but with Melania Trump sidelined this year, that task has fallen to other speakers who have painted a sympathetic portrait of Trump by sharing anecdotes about the warm relationship between him and their children. For example, Trump's 17-year-old granddaughter, Kai Trump, called him \"just a regular grandpa.\"", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dior", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiletto_heel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stiletto heel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Louboutin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Louboutin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/7/19/gettyimages-2162620945.jpg?size=2010x1050", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 88, "textEnd": 95}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Donald Trump is the best choice. My fellow Americans it is my honor to introduce the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe Trumps have presented a united front for the former president's campaign and have reiterated the theme of family values throughout the RNC.\n\nTrump's granddaughter, Kai Madison, took the stage at the RNC last night to praise her grandfather.\n\nKai, 17, is the daughter of Donald Trump Jr. and the former president's eldest grandchild.\n\nHer father, who has also been active in the former president's re-election campaign, introduced her and told the crowd that she asked to speak after Trump's attempted assassination.\n\n\"To me, he's just a normal grandpa,\" Kai told the crowd.\n\n\"A lot of people have put my grandpa through hell and he's still standing,\" she continued.\n\nEric's wife and Kai's aunt, Lara, also gave a rousing speech on the first day of the RNC.\n\nLara was named the co-chair of the RNC and has been vocal on the campaign trail for her father-in-law.\n\n\"There's no doubt that Saturday was one of the most frightening moments of my father-in-law's life. Millimeters separated him from life and certain death,\" Lara told the RNC attendees.\n\nShe addressed the assassination attempt on Trump during a campaign rally and painted her father-in-law as a defiant political hero.\n\nIn addition to Trump's family, prominent Republicans are also rallying behind the former president's re-election campaign.\n\nFormer UN Ambassador and presidential candidate, Nikki Haley endorsed Trump on the second day of the RNC - a move that shocked many following her campaign.\n\nNikki was a strong critic of Trump during the primary election cycle but opted to support him in the general election.\n\nThe former South Carolina Governor admitted that she didn't always agree with Trump, but added, \"President Trump asked me to speak to this convention in the name of unity.\n\n\"It was a gracious invitation and I was happy to accept.\"\n\nFormer presidential candidates Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy also rallied the crowd at the RNC in support of Trump.\n\nThe RNC kicked off just two days after an assassination attempt on Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nA bullet grazed Trump's ear and he fell to the ground before the Secret Service ushered him off stage.\n\nThomas Matthew Crooks was identified as the gunman, but questions still loom over his motive.\n\nFBI agents have launched a case into the assassination and have reportedly found images of Trump and President Biden on the gunman's phone.\n\nThe New York Times also reported searches of an unnamed member of the Royal Family on Crooks' phone.\n\nFootage has also recently emerged of the gunman walking near the rally just an hour before opening fire.\n\nAn attendee turned over footage of the crowd which included Crooks walking behind a screen at the rally.\n\nCrooks was positioned on a nearby rooftop about 430 feet away from the stage.\n\nSecret Service snipers shot and killed him 26 seconds after he opened fire.\n\nLaw enforcement spotted him just minutes before he fired his first shots.\n\nSecret Service has taken heat for the incident, resulting in calls for director Kimberly Cheatle to step down.\n\nWhile Republicans are in Milwaukee to formally tap Trump as the presidential nominee, Democrats seem divided over supporting Biden's re-election campaign.\n\nAfter Biden and Trump's first presidential debate, discussions began on the possibility of Biden dropping out of the race.\n\nRepresentative Lloyd Doggett was the first lawmaker to publicly call for Biden to step aside, and nearly 20 members of Congress have since joined him.\n\nProminent Democrats are also reportedly having those conversations behind closed doors, with several sources close to the president telling Axios that they don't think he can win against Trump in November.\n\nSources also told ABC News that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are considering delaying the Democrat nomination process.\n\nA spokesperson for Schumer responded to the report with a statement saying the senator had already conveyed his views directly to Biden.\n\nCNN has also reported that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a conversation with Biden over negative polling and her concern that Democrats will lose their bid for the House if he stays in the race.\n\nThe most recent report comes from former President Obama, who told allies that Biden's \"path to victory has greatly diminished and he thinks the president needs to seriously consider the viability of his candidacy,\" according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe concerns come as Biden announced on Wednesday that he was diagnosed with Covid-19 and had to cancel campaign events in the battleground state of Nevada.\n\nTrump's camp is capitalizing on the Democratic divide, with his co-campaign manager speculating that Democrats are staging a \"coup\" against Biden.\n\n\"They are actively engaged in an attempt - in my view and a lot of people share this view - in deposing the president of the United States,\" Chris LaCivita told Politico.\n\nThe Democrats must secure their plan and message by the Democratic National Convention, which is set to start on August 19 in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe Republicans have rallied around their message at the RNC, expressing support for Trump and echoing policies on strict immigration and an America-first mentality.\n\nTrump is anticipated to angle his speech on unity and outline his message ahead of the general election.\n\nHe reportedly ripped up his speech after the assassination attempt to focus more on unity and will not mention Biden by name.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sophie_gable@thesun.ie", "name": "Sophie Gable", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dana White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kid Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

She had not been spotted in Milwaukee since the convention kicked off on Monday.\n\nLast week, Melania issued a statement calling for unity following an assassination attempt against Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence. We all want a world where respect is paramount, family is first, and love transcends. We can realise this world again. Each of us must demand to get it back. We must insist that respect fills the cornerstone of our relationships again,\" she said in a statement.\n\nIt is traditional at party conventions for the candidates' spouses to give a speech and tell heavily-scripted anecdotes about family life.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Usha Vance - the wife of Trump's newly-minted running mate JD Vance - did just that. But Melania skipped delivering a speech.\n\nEver since her husband was first elected in 2016, Melania Trump has broken all the rules of normal American presidential politics.\n\nIn the White House during Trump's first term, she was a reclusive figure compared to other first ladies, focusing on a narrow set of interests.\n\nAnd since her husband left office, she has not been seen by her husband's side on many occasions.\n\nShe wasn't there when he had his mugshot taken in Atlanta. She wasn't there in New York when he became the first former president to be convicted of a crime. And she wasn't there when he officially won his party's presidential nomination, for the third time, on Monday.\n\nThe former first lady spoke in both 2020 and 2016 during Trump's presidential nomination. She was accused of borrowing from Michelle Obama's 2008 speech in her first appearance in 2016.

But the unexpected return of his wife Melania Trump to the limelight was arguably the biggest talking point of the night. The former First Lady, 54, strode onto the stage sporting a striking red dress to thunderous applause and wild cheers prior to Trump's speech, after which she greeted her husband with an awkward kiss as balloons cascaded from the ceiling.\n\nMelania until last night had practically vanished from public life and the media, refusing to accompany her husband on the campaign trail and remaining absent even through his court battles in New York over the Stormy Daniels hush money payments. Amid a difficult period that saw the death of her mother in January, followed by Trump's legal strife and now the imminent departure of son Barron for college, many speculated that the former president had lost the support of his wife.\n\nBut Trump's brush with death in Pennsylvania last weekend seems to have prompted Melania's return to the fore as the Republican nominee pushes for a second term in the White House. The former First Lady declined to speak at yesterday's RNC in Milwaukee despite Trump and many members of his campaign staff urging her to do so, according to sources cited by CNN's Kaitlin Collins. But many commentators agreed that her presence alone was hugely significant, signalling an end to her total absence on the campaign trail that had undoubtedly harmed Trump's bid for the presidency.\n\nThough she'd still made a few notable public appearances of her own accord for various initiatives, Melania had not appeared alongside her husband since he announced his intention to run for office again almost two years ago. Her behaviour was a stark contrast to that of her counterpart Jill Biden, who is seemingly hellbent on appearing by her struggling husband's side at every public event, speech and rally. Melania is yet to comment on her decision to shelter away from the public's gaze, but Trump's wife has experienced a particularly turbulent period in her personal life as of late.\n\nIn January, she revealed her mother had died aged 78 - the same age her husband is now - after a long period of illness. 'It is with deep sadness that I announce the passing of my beloved mother, Amalija,' she said in a public statement at the time. 'Amalija Knavs was a strong woman who always carried herself with grace, warmth, and dignity. She was entirely devoted to her husband, daughters, grandson, and son-in-law. We will miss her beyond measure and continue to honor and love her legacy.' Melania missed most of the Christmas and New Year celebrations at Mar-a-Lago to care for her ailing mother prior to her death.\n\nMelania continued her absence from Trump's public appearances throughout the year, and refused to attend any of her embattled husband's court hearings in connection with his trial over hush money payments made to [adult entertainment] star Stormy Daniels. Over the course of almost two months of hearings, a series of Republican lawmakers, former administration officials, vice presidential hopefuls and even a few of his own kids were spotted lending their support in the New York courthouse.\n\nThey sat through hours of salacious testimony as the ex-president stood trial on 34 counts of falsifying business records - charges on which he was ultimately convicted. But Melania remained far away from the courtroom, opting to stay at the Trump residence in Mar-a-Lago, Florida. The move was seen by many as damaging for Trump's defence, with legal experts telling DailyMail.com that it is often beneficial for a jury to see defendants with their spouse by their side in the courthouse.\n\n'Generally speaking, jurors pay attention to who is seated in the courtroom,' explained Anna Cominsky, Managing Attorney of New York Law School Legal Services. 'Defense attorneys usually like to have ''support'' for their client evidenced by friends and family - it's something that humanizes the client. That said, this is a very different case. The jurors know that this is the former president.' In the aftermath of Trump's guilty verdict, Daniels - who alleged she had an affair with the billionaire just a year after he married Melania - said his wife 'needs to leave him' because 'it's been proven he is abusive' and he 'is now a criminal'.\n\nTrump himself admitted in an interview on Fox & Friends that his trial was 'very hard' on Melania. Though Melania had not stood by her husband's side amid the Stormy Daniels courtroom saga, the former first lady was at least spotted alongside her husband elsewhere.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

They've taken advantage of us for years. We lose jobs, we lose revenue, and they gain everything and wipe out our businesses, wipe out our people. I stopped it for four years\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and I will stop it again,\" Trump said, in remarks that underscored the Republican party's populist and protectionist shift under his leadership.\n\n\"We will not let countries come in, take our jobs and plunder our nation,\" Trump added. \"The way they will sell their product in America is to build it in America, and only in America.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly invoked God on Thursday night as he recounted the attempt on his life last weekend and insisted that a higher power had saved him from a premature death.\n\n\"I'm not supposed to be here,\" he said, before detailing what happened when a shooter attempted to kill him at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. That prompted cheers from the crowd: \"Yes you are.\"\n\n\"I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God,\" added Trump.\n\nDivine intervention was a perennial theme of the four-day Republican National Convention, with countless speakers crediting God with saving Trump's life.\n\nBefore Trump's keynote speech on Thursday night, Franklin Graham, the son of famed evangelical pastor Billy Graham, led the arena in a prayer for the Republican nominee.\n\nTrump was flanked by nearly all of his close family members as he formally accepted the Republican party's nomination for president. That included a rare public appearance by his wife, Melania Trump, who has avoided the campaign trail since her husband launched his latest bid for the White House in November 2022.\n\nMelania, who is Trump's third wife, entered the convention arena on her own, while a recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony blared over the loudspeakers.\n\nAlso notable was the appearance of Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner. The couple were fixtures of the Trump White House as senior advisers to the then president. But Ivanka had until Thursday elected not to appear publicly in support of her father's latest White House bid.\n\nShe joined three of her four siblings -- Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump -- along with their partners and several of her nieces and nephews on stage with the family patriarch after his speech.\n\nTrump's delivery on Thursday night was in many instances more sombre than usual, an apparent reflection of the seriousness of the assassination attempt he survived just days earlier.\n\nTrump nevertheless revived some of the jokes and one-liners he often invokes on the campaign trail, including: \"The late, great, Hannibal Lecter. We'd love to have you for dinner.\"\n\nHis energy level at times seemed low. His voice was muted and inaudible to some in the huge Milwaukee arena at some points.\n\nYet the crowd still cheered him on, and the display of stamina -- Trump spoke for more than 90 minutes, often digressing from his prepared remarks -- offered a contrast to Joe Biden's recent struggles.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protectionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._9_(Beethoven)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Lecter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hannibal Lecter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Little has changed since then. Her continued detachment from campaign events and rallies, her absence in all the primaries save Florida's (where she voted), her skipping her husband's lengthy hush money trial and his June 28 debate against President Joe Biden come alongside the strong speculation that she won't live full-time in the White House again should Trump be re-elected.\n\nAll of it taken together seems only to confirm that her distance from Trump's political life will continue no matter what happens Nov. 5. Melania Trump has, it is true, held two campaign fundraisers for the Log Cabin Republicans at her homes; but by contrast, first lady Jill Biden has held frequent fundraising tours with multiple destinations.\n\nJill Biden, described as \"defender-in-chief\" of her husband's campaign by the Economist, and described by The New York Times as \"comforter-in-chief\" to some jittery Democrats, has visited red states and blue ones, often alone, and been an actively political surrogate for her husband. Melania Trump's limited appearances could not be in starker contrast.\n\nThough she has been harder to find, Melania Trump is planning to attend the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. However, unlike she did in 2016 and 2020, this time she does not plan to speak. Her silence will end an unbroken tradition that goes back to Barbara Bush in 1992 of first ladies and candidates' spouses giving significant addresses at conventions.\n\nAs long as she is visible at the convention, even if she's silent, Melania Trump will win plaudits from Trump fans, many of whom only want more of her. Still, her silence and her rare appearances are further evidence, as Katie Rogers noted recently, that Melania Trump has significantly reshaped the role of first lady: \"She broke open the role and actually showed us [that] you don't have to do anything with it if you don't want to.\"\n\nFor more than a century, whether they desired it or not, first ladies have been highly visible campaigners. As many American women got to vote for the first time in 1920, for example, Florence Harding eagerly stood on her front porch, in what was called the Front Porch Campaign, hosting tens of thousands of visitors alongside her husband, President Warren G. Harding. Similarly, Eleanor Roosevelt called for Franklin D. Roosevelt's unprecedented third term during her \"no ordinary time\" speech at the Democratic convention in 1940, a step that, as First Ladies Association for Research and Education President Nancy Kegan Smith notes, \"was credited with helping FDR to unify the convention.\"\n\nTwo decades later, Lady Bird Johnson was the first to take to the hustings on her own, with the whistle-stop tour in 1964 -- a bold venture into a hostile South that helped bring about LBJ's victory. Pat Nixon was the next to appear at a convention, in 1972, thrilled to offer remarks about her husband, Richard Nixon, following an eight-minute standing ovation. Then in 1992, Barbara Bush, already known for a significant speech at Wellesley College, had the opportunity to speak \"about the centrality of family ... in a model of conciliatory rhetoric,\" as scholar Myra Gutin explains.\n\nSince then, first ladies' speeches at conventions have often focused on family matters; Hillary Clinton spoke of children and family in 1996, as did Michelle Obama in 2008: \"I come here as a wife; I come here as a mom.\" In 2012, Michelle Obama further highlighted hers and President Barack Obama's humble family histories. In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, Jill Biden offered a speech \"as a mother and a grandmother\" from a classroom at a high school where she once taught. Both Melania Trump's speeches in 2016 and 2020 were similarly focused on family, addressing mothers like herself -- and women as a whole.\n\nThis theme of family was also echoed by Melania Trump this past weekend in the wake of the assassination attempt on her husband. In an effort to reach across the aisle, she pointed out that \"every single politician is a man or a woman with a loving family.\" Her statement was heartfelt and empathic, calling for Americans to see each other as \"human beings.\" Considering her absence during so much of the campaign so far, her outspokenness at this moment was notable -- and will likely carry significant political weight. Her comments, of course, stand in stark contrast to the way her husband told supporters to \"fight like hell\" right before the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nMelania Trump's words were important in humanizing her husband, and they suggest that GOP strategist Alex Conant is overlooking something significant when he claims that \"people vote for the presidential candidate, not their spouse or their vice president.\" This is because for more than a century now, whether they are particularly interested in politicking or not, first ladies have served their spouses' campaigns immeasurably, by humanizing and broadening their appeal. With her statement, Melania Trump did just that after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. And Jill Biden's call to her in the wake of the attack underlined the sisterhood of first ladies, all of whom know that what happened Saturday is what each of them dreads the most.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_Cabin_Republicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Log Cabin Republicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbara Bush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red states and blue states"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

a move that shocked many following her campaign.\n\nNikki was a strong critic of Trump during the primary election cycle but opted to support him in the general election.\n\nThe former South Carolina Governor admitted that she didn't always agree with Trump, but added, \"President Trump asked me to speak to this convention in the name of unity.\n\n\"It was a gracious invitation and I was happy to accept.\"\n\nFormer presidential candidates Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy also rallied the crowd at the RNC in support of Trump.\n\nThe RNC kicked off just two days after an assassination attempt on Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nA bullet grazed Trump's ear and he fell to the ground before the Secret Service ushered him off stage.\n\nThomas Matthew Crooks was identified as the gunman, but questions still loom over his motive.\n\nFBI agents have launched a case into the assassination and have reportedly found images of Trump and President Biden on the gunman's phone.\n\nThe New York Times also reported searches of an unnamed member of the Royal Family on Crooks' phone.\n\nFootage has also recently emerged of the gunman walking near the rally just an hour before opening fire.\n\nAn attendee turned over footage of the crowd which included Crooks walking behind a screen at the rally.\n\nCrooks was positioned on a nearby rooftop about 430 feet away from the stage.\n\nSecret Service snipers shot and killed him 26 seconds after he opened fire.\n\nLaw enforcement spotted him just minutes before he fired his first shots.\n\nSecret Service has taken heat for the incident, resulting in calls for director Kimberly Cheatle to step down.\n\nWhile Republicans are in Milwaukee to formally tap Trump as the presidential nominee, Democrats seem divided over supporting Biden's re-election campaign.\n\nAfter Biden and Trump's first presidential debate, discussions began on the possibility of Biden dropping out of the race.\n\nRepresentative Lloyd Doggett was the first lawmaker to publicly call for Biden to step aside, and nearly 20 members of Congress have since joined him.\n\nProminent Democrats are also reportedly having those conversations behind closed doors, with several sources close to the president telling Axios that they don't think he can win against Trump in November.\n\nSources also told ABC News that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are considering delaying the Democrat nomination process.\n\nA spokesperson for Schumer responded to the report with a statement saying the senator had already conveyed his views directly to Biden.\n\nCNN has also reported that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a conversation with Biden over negative polling and her concern that Democrats will lose their bid for the House if he stays in the race.\n\nThe most recent report comes from former President Obama, who told allies that Biden's \"path to victory has greatly diminished and he thinks the president needs to seriously consider the viability of his candidacy,\" according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe concerns come as Biden announced on Wednesday that he was diagnosed with Covid-19 and had to cancel campaign events in the battleground state of Nevada.\n\nTrump's camp is capitalizing on the Democratic divide, with his co-campaign manager speculating that Democrats are staging a \"coup\" against Biden.\n\n\"They are actively engaged in an attempt -

This request came shortly after an assassination attempt at one of her father's rallies in Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kai took the stage with a beaming smile on her face to give her first big speech, according to her father.\n\nShe said she wanted to share a side of the former president \"people don't often see.\"\n\n\"To me, he's just a normal grandpa,\" Kai said, mentioning how he gives her candy and soda when her parents aren't around.\n\nThe 17-year-old also shares Trump's love of golf and mentioned how he tries to get in her head when they play together.\n\n\"And he's always surprised that I don't let him get to me,\" she said.\n\nMelania Trump made a rare public appearance at the RNC during the final day of the convention.\n\nShe came out alone after the rest of the family, waving to attendees with a bright smile on her face.\n\nDuring Trump's speech, the former First Lady sat with her family in the VIP box.\n\nHowever, when Trump concluded, Melania made her way out on stage surprising the former president when she appeared on his left.\n\nHe quickly wrapped his arm around her, smiled for what looked like some pictures, then went in for a kiss.\n\nMelania dodged his attempt, not returning his kiss.\n\nTo recover from the awkward moment, Trump kissed her cheek instead.\n\nThe former First Lady broke tradition on Thursday night after denying to introduce Trump before his speech.\n\nIn the past, the candidate's husband or wife makes a speech to humanize them at political events.\n\nShe had previously introduced Trump at the RNC in 2016 and 2020.\n\n'SHOULD'NT BE HERE'\n\nTrump spoke for the first time on Thursday night after the assassination attempt that left the former president with a bloody gunshot wound to the ear.\n\nA gunman, identified as Thomas Crooks, 20, was aiming for Trump's head, but he moved at the last second.\n\nDuring his 92-minute acceptance speech as the Republican nominee, he detailed the moment he realized he was shot, saying he would only tell it once because it was \"too painful.\"\n\nHe recalled talking about his administration's work at the Southern border and turned around to look at the chart behind him.\n\nTrump showed how he turned his head and then explained that all of a sudden he felt \"something\" hit him \"really really hard\" on his right ear.\n\n\"I said to myself 'Wow what was that?' It could only be a bullet,\" he said.\n\nHe described how there was \"blood all over the place\" but he felt \"serene\" and safe with the Secret Service protecting him.\n\n\"If I had not moved my head at that moment, the assassin's bullet would've hit its mark,\" he told the crowd.\n\nHe added: \"I'm not supposed to be here tonight. I'm not supposed to be here.\"\n\n\"I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of all mighty god\"\n\nTrump then honored volunteer firefighter, Corey Comperatore, who lost his life in the shooting.\n\nHe asked the crowd to join him in a moment of silence.\n\nHis family had sent Corey's helmet and jacket which was on stage while the former president spoke.\n\nIn a touching moment, Trump walked up to his uniform and kissed the helmet.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_&_Co.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany & Co."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanessa Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soft drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_silence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moment of silence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Speech_Synthesis", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Speech Synthesis", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Tool_Kits", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Tool Kits", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Research", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Research", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/07/gives-granddaughter-kai-warm-greeting-918217956.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Melania addressed the 2016 and 2020 Republican conventions where her husband was nominated previously.\n\nAlso present at the RNC on Thursday were Donald J Trump's elder daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, who, like Melania, have been absent from Trump's 2024 campaign to be president.\n\n'The display of family harmony underscored an effort by the Republican party this week,' Reuters noted, 'to portray its nominee as a caring family man and selfless public servant who has been unfairly maligned by Democratic opponents who warn he could become a dictator if re-elected.'\n\nIMAGE: Melania Trump arrives on Day 4 of the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, July 18, 2024.

Quite simply put, we will very quickly make America great again.\"\n\nHowever, a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment from the Milwaukee convention has become a talking point on social media because of an interaction -- or apparent lack thereof -- between the onetime business mogul and his daughter.\n\nIn the clip, which has been posted on X, formerly Twitter, Tiffany Trump, 30, was seen smiling at her 78-year-old father while walking up a set of stairs to take her seat at the event.\n\nDonald Trump appears to briefly glance at his daughter before turning his head away.

On Jan. 25, 2025, the former first couple will toast 20 years of marriage.\n\nTwenty years ago, Donald Trump and then-fianc\u00e9 Melania Knauss, her professional modeling name, were busy planning their lavish nuptials in Palm Beach, Florida - the wedding at Bethesda-By-the-Sea Episcopal Church, followed by a wedding reception in the new Donald J. Trump Ballroom at his private club.\n\nMuch has happened since the Trumps tied the knot; his third trip down the aisle and her first:\n\nAnd a lot has happened to the wedding venue Mar-a-Lago since 2005: Several Trump family members were married or hosted wedding receptions there. Ahead of the milestone wedding anniversary of Donald and Melania Trump, here's a look at who (and who didn't) include Trump's private club Mar-a-Lago in their wedding nuptials.\n\nMelania Trump was born Melanija Knavs April 26, 1970, in Novo Mesto, Slovenia, according to her bio on the White House Historical Association's website. As Melania Knauss, she began her modeling career at age 16 and moved to New York in 1996. Donald Trump met the model in 1998 at a New York fashion party, became engaged in 2004 and married in 2005.\n\nTwenty years ago, Melania Knauss was just a bride-to-be, squeezing in wedding dress fittings, finalizing celebrity invites and reception dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Melania Knauss became Mrs. Donald Trump on a Saturday evening in January 2005.\n\nThe photo gallery below is a look back at wedding preparations for Donald and Melania Trump and what we know about their Jan. 25, 2005, wedding, from archived photos and coverage of the Palm Beach Post, the Palm Beach Daily News and USA TODAY Network-Florida.\n\nOn Nov. 12, 2005, Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of Donald Trump and first wife Ivana Trump, married former model Vanessa Kay Trump, formerly Vanessa Kay Pergolizzi. Donald Trump introduced Donald Trump Jr. to Vanessa at a fashion show in 2003. The couple married at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach in front of about 370 guests, reports show, with the service officiated by Donald Trump's sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry. Donald Trump Jr. and Vanessa Trump were 27 years old when they wed, weeks before they both turned 28 in December 2005.\n\nDonald Trump Jr.'s siblings were in the wedding party: Ivanka Trump was a bridesmaid, and Eric Trump was a groomsman.\n\nVanessa and Donald Trump Jr. had five children together - Kai Trump, Donald Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump and Chloe Trump - before they eventually divorced, after 12 years of marriage, in 2018.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. is engaged to Kimberly Guilfoyle.\n\nOn Nov. 8, 2014, after a six-year relationship, Lara Yunaska married Eric Trump in a ceremony at Mar-a-Lago. Eric Trump, then 30 and son of Donald Trump and his first wife, Ivana Trump, married the TV producer in a ceremony that included 450 guests and was held on the lawn of the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, USA TODAY reports in a November 2014 story.\n\nWedding guests included Eric Trump's mom Ivana Trump, radio personality Elvis Duran and former \"Real Housewives of New York\" star Jill Zarin, according to People magazine.\n\nThe family of Eric Trump's sister, Ivanka Trump, had roles in the wedding: Ivanka Trump's daughter was a flower girl and Ivanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, officiated at the wedding, according to the Daily News. The Daily Mail reports that Lara Trump's dog, Charlie, was the ring bearer.\n\nTwo weeks before her wedding to Eric Trump, the bride, Lara Yunaska, broke both of her wrists in a horse riding accident. She chose to wear Vera Wang -- one gown for the ceremony and another for the reception.\n\nOn Oct. 25, 2009, Ivanka Trump, eldest daughter of Donald and Ivana Trump, married Jared Kushner, who previously owned the New York Observer. The 27-year-old bride and 28-year-old groom tied the knot at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, in front of about 500 guests.\n\nNews reports show the guest list included celebrities such as Russell Crowe, Regis Philbin, Natalie Portman, Barbara Walters, Rudy Giuliani, Andrew Cuomo, country singer Jamey Johnson, Emmy Rossum and then-boyfriend Adam Duritz of the band Counting Crows.\n\nIvanka Trump wore a Vera Wang gown reminiscent of Princess Grace Kelly's wedding dress. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are parents to three children, Arabella Rose Kushner, Joseph Frederick Kushner and Theodore James Kushner.\n\nOn Nov. 12, 2022, Tiffany Trump and Michael Boulos were married at Donald Trump's private club Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida. More than 500 guests attended the wedding of the former president's youngest daughter, then 29, to the 25-year-old Lebanese-American billionaire. Tiffany Trump is the younger daughter of the former president and his second wife Marla Maples.\n\nThe couple, who got engaged after two years of dating, met in 2018, when Boulos was studying project management at City University of London and Tiffany Trump was a law student at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Both were vacationing in Santorini and met in Mykonos at Lindsay Lohan's Beach Club, according to People magazine.\n\nTiffany Trump announced her engagement to Boulos on her father's last day in office; her fiance proposed in the White House Rose Garden. In an homage to her husband's Lebanese heritage, the bride chose Lebanese designer Elie Saab to design her dress, according to the Palm Beach Daily News.\n\nThree days before the wedding, Florida was in the path of Hurricane Nicole. The wedding occurred without issue from the storm.\n\nThey do!

Melania Trump arrived at the convention at around 9 p.m. CT on Thursday, which is her first appearance at the convention.\n\nThe post, made by X user Ian Miles Cheong, a Trump supporter, has already received 56,100 in the past 20 minutes.\n\nWhile the Trumps have held hands while posing for photos in the past, they are not known to partake in a lot of public displays of affection. MelaniaTrump has been seen pulling her hand away from Donald Trump or even swatting away the gesture from her husband.\n\nMelania Trump is wearing a red skirt suit in the photo and Donald Trump is wearing his signature Blue suit with a red tie. Donald Trump's head is turned to show the bandage on his right ear, which was injured during a recent assassination attempt.\n\nWhile speaking at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday at around 6 p.m. ET, Trump was struck with a bullet to the ear in what the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investing as an assassination attempt.\n\nThe shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by a U.S. Secret Service counter-sniper. One rally attendee, 50-year-old former firefighter Corey Comperatore, was killed in the shooting and two more were seriously injured, according to the Secret Service.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said in an Oval Office address Sunday night that law enforcement officials are investigating the shooting. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Lousiana Republican and Trump ally, said that the House will conduct a full investigation of the shooting.\n\nAs a sign of solidarity, Trump supporters at the convention have been wearing bandages on their right ears.\n\nTrump made his first appearance at the RNC on Monday, the same day Ohio Senator JD Vance was announced as the former president's running mate. During his RNC speech on Wednesday, Vance said, \"I pledge to every American, no matter your party, I will give everything I have.\"\n\n\"To serve you and to make this country a place where every dream you have for yourself, your family and your country will be possible once again,\" he said.\n\nVance, a Trump critic turned fierce ally, is fairly new to Congress. He was elected to the Senate in 2022. He opposes abortion rights, U.S. support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, and has a tough anti-immigration stance.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_dobkin@newsweek.com", "name": "Rachel Dobkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2432235/donald-melania-trump.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=18d2db95ac333878359f0c7ae4b4dbed", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

His goal was to prepare the audience and generate enthusiasm for Trump's upcoming speech.\n\n\"My father saw potential when others saw disparity,\" Eric said when discussing his father's upbringing.\n\nEric claimed that Trump \"built the New York City skyline\" and said his father didn't care about being \"politically correct.\"\n\nEric praised his father's administration, stating, \"He brought back hope, gave a voice to millions of overlooked Americans, and reignited the American Dream.\"\n\nEric praised the economy during his father's administration and said his father \"made the United States safe.\"\n\n\"My father has been censored. The former president ripped off Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. My father has been persecuted,\" he added.\n\n\"My father has been pulled off the ballots of states.\"\n\n\"My father even became the target of an assassin.\"\n\nEric also discussed illegal immigration, reiterating a common theme discussed throughout the RNC.\n\n\"Your government can do so much better - and it will,\" Eric added.\n\nHe said his father \"believed in the promise of America when others turned away.\"\n\nEric added that he has \"never been more proud to be a Trump.\"\n\n\"Never have I been more proud to be by my father's side,\" he said as his voice cracked.\n\nEric then directed his attention to his father, saying that their family \"held their breath\" as they saw \"blood pour across his face.\"\n\nHe praised his father for his strength and his ability to fight.\n\nDescribing a specific incident, Eric highlighted Trump's strength, recalling a moment where Trump bravely faced a challenging situation by wiping blood across his face. Eric called this act one of the most courageous moments in American political history.\n\nThe Trumps have presented a united front for the former president's campaign and have reiterated the theme of family values throughout the RNC.\n\nTrump's granddaughter, Kai Madison, took the stage at the RNC last night to praise her grandfather.\n\nKai, 17, is the daughter of Donald Trump Jr. and the former president's eldest grandchild.\n\nHer father, who has also been active in the former president's re-election campaign, introduced her and told the crowd that she asked to speak after Trump's attempted assassination.\n\n\"To me, he's just a normal grandpa,\" Kai told the crowd.\n\n\"A lot of people have put my grandpa through hell and he's still standing,\" she continued.\n\nEric's wife and Kai's aunt, Lara, also gave a rousing speech on the first day of the RNC.\n\nLara was named the co-chair of the RNC and has been vocal on the campaign trail for her father-in-law.\n\n\"There's no doubt that Saturday was one of the most frightening moments of my father-in-law's life. Millimeters separated him from life and certain death,\" Lara told the RNC attendees.\n\nShe addressed the assassination attempt on Trump during a campaign rally and painted her father-in-law as a defiant political hero.\n\nRED UNITY\n\nIn addition to Trump's family, prominent Republicans are also rallying behind the former president's re-election campaign.\n\nFormer UN Ambassador and presidential candidate, Nikki Haley endorsed Trump on the second day of the RNC - a move that shocked many following her campaign.\n\nNikki was a strong critic of Trump during the primary election cycle but opted to support him in the general election.\n\nThe former South Carolina Governor admitted that she didn't always agree with Trump, but added, \"President Trump asked me to speak to this convention in the name of unity.\n\n\"It was a gracious invitation and I was happy to accept.\"\n\nFormer presidential candidates Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy also rallied the crowd at the RNC in support of Trump.\n\nASSASSINATION QUESTIONS LOOM\n\nThe RNC kicked off just two days after an assassination attempt on Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nA bullet grazed Trump's ear and he fell to the ground before the Secret Service ushered him off stage.\n\nThomas Matthew Crooks was identified as the gunman, but questions still loom over his motive.\n\nFBI agents have launched a case into the assassination and have reportedly found images of Trump and President Biden on the gunman's phone.\n\nThe New York Times also reported searches of an unnamed member of the Royal Family on Crooks' phone.\n\nFootage has also recently emerged of the gunman walking near the rally just an hour before opening fire.\n\nAn attendee turned over footage of the crowd which included Crooks walking behind a screen at the rally.\n\nCrooks was positioned on a nearby rooftop about 430 feet away from the stage.\n\nSecret Service snipers shot and killed him 26 seconds after he opened fire.\n\nLaw enforcement spotted him just minutes before he fired his first shots.\n\nSecret Service has taken heat for the incident, resulting in calls for director Kimberly Cheatle to step down.\n\nON THE DEM SIDE\n\nWhile Republicans are in Milwaukee to formally tap Trump as the presidential nominee, Democrats seem divided over supporting Biden's re-election campaign.\n\nAfter Biden and Trump's first presidential debate, discussions began on the possibility of Biden dropping out of the race.\n\nRepresentative Lloyd Doggett was the first lawmaker to publicly call for Biden to step aside, and nearly 20 members of Congress have since joined him.\n\nProminent Democrats are also reportedly having those conversations behind closed doors, with several sources close to the president telling Axios that they don't think he can win against Trump in November.\n\nSources also told ABC News that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are considering delaying the Democrat nomination process.\n\nA spokesperson for Schumer responded to the report with a statement saying the senator had already conveyed his views directly to Biden.\n\nCNN has also reported that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a conversation with Biden over negative polling and her concern that Democrats will lose their bid for the House if he stays in the race.\n\nThe most recent report comes from former President Obama, who told allies that Biden's \"path to victory has greatly diminished and he thinks the president needs to seriously consider the viability of his candidacy,\" according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe concerns come as Biden announced on Wednesday that he was diagnosed with Covid-19 and had to cancel campaign events in the battleground state of Nevada.\n\nTrump's camp is capitalizing on the Democratic divide, with his co-campaign manager speculating that Democrats are staging a \"coup\" against Biden.\n\n\"They are actively engaged in an attempt - in my view and a lot of people share this view - in deposing the president of the United States,\" Chris LaCivita told Politico.\n\nThe Democrats must secure their plan and message by the Democratic National Convention, which is set to start on August 19 in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe Republicans have rallied around their message at the RNC, expressing support for Trump and echoing policies on strict immigration and an America-first mentality.\n\nTrump is anticipated to angle his speech on unity and outline his message ahead of the general election.\n\nHe reportedly ripped up his speech after the assassination attempt to focus more on unity and will not mention Biden by name.\n\nDana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, is taking the stage next to introduce the former president.\n\nWhite and Trump are longtime friends, and the UFC tycoon is a strong supporter of Trump's presidency.", "source": {"uri":

In response, Melania flashed a giant grin -- dare we say the happiest we've seen her in a while. The more playful moment came when she joined him on stage, though. As seen in ABC News' footage from the event, it almost appeared as though she was sneaking up on him, and as she finally reached him, Donald seemed genuinely surprised. The couple laughed before going into a crazy awkward attempt by Donald at kissing his wife, with Melania going instead for a hug. However, even with the awkwardness, they seemed to laugh it off and moved to the side holding hands as the rest of the Trump family joined them.\n\nIt certainly seemed as though they were a happy couple with a fun side -- but again, we're not sure if we can take this at face value.", "source": {"uri": "nickiswift.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NickiSwift.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tessa_hayley_hellberg@nickiswift.com", "name": "Tessa Hayley Hellberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

His earlier presence at a rally in Florida led to a huge round of applause. After receiving a warm welcome at his father's rally in Florida, Barron Trump, the youngest son of former US President Donald Trump has not attended any of the other political gatherings. His absence during the party's national convention has raised questions pertaining to his presence in his father's election campaign.\n\nDonald Trump's speech at the national convention on Thursday was attended by all his family members which included his wife Melania Trump, four children and their partner. His fifth child Barron Trump was not to be seen in Milwaukee. Earlier, his first public appearance during the Florida rally was welcomed by the Republicans and he received a loud round of applause from Trump's supporters.\n\nHe is the youngest son of Donald Trump and is believed to have just graduated from high school. Addressing a crowd in Florida, earlier this month, Trump had said that he has received many offers from different universities and will be attending a good university. The name of the university is not known yet.\n\nHis appearance in the Florida rally was his first public appearance. He was well received by Trump's supporters. Trump at a point of time even joked that Barron was more popular than his other sons.\n\nOnce again, on Thursday thanked his family members and the mere mention of the name Barron led to the crowd clapping and cheering for him. Trump smiled and added that \"we love our Barron\".\n\nIt has also reported that Barron did not attend his father's rally at Pennsylvania. During this rally, there was an assassination attempt on Trump.\n\nThe former First Lady has also not participated in any of the political rallies of her husband. She entered the venue of the national convention, minutes before Trump took to the stage and delivered a speech. Melania had addressed the party's national convention in 2016 and 2020. On Thursday, she did not address the gathering.\n\nDuring his speech, did Trump mention anything about the ongoing Gaza war?\n\nHe supported Israel. He also threatened Gaza and called on them to release the hostages.

Trump is scheduled to address the delegates at 9 pm ET.\n\nNeither Melania nor Ivanka are scheduled to speak on Thursday night even though both spoke at previous Republican conventions and had the option to address this year's.\n\nNancy Mace posts photos with Speaker Mike Johnson and Lauren Boebert: 'Unity'\n\nRep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., posted two photos from the convention floor of her with Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo. 'UNITY,' she captioned it.\n\nTrump exits VIP booth as Alina Habba takes the stage\n\nThe former president walked out of the VIP booth around 7:15pm ET as his aide Alina Habba took the convention stage.\n\nMelania should be arriving at any minute - and Trump may be going to meet her.\n\nHis wife alongisde Ivanka Trump, along with Jared Kushner, were spotted boarding Trump Force One a few hours ago for the flight to Milwaukee.\n\nThey are not expected to have speaking roles.\n\nCountry star Jason Aldean and his wife join Trump's VIP box\n\nFrom Kelly Laco, executive editor of politics, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin:\n\nCountry music star Jason Aldean and his wife Brittany are in Trump's VIP box at the convention Thursday for the final night.\n\nThe singer was noticeably dressed much more casually than other Trump allies and supporters.\n\nSens. Eric Schmitt, Missouri, John Barrasso, Wyoming, Mike Lee, Utah, and Ted Cruz, Texas, were spotted one row above. Wisconsin GOP senate Eric Hovde was standing next to Cruz.\n\nJason Aldean is set to perform at a convention afterparty at the Potawatomi Casino Hotel.\n\nHulk Hogan says assassination attempt compelled him to publicly support his 'hero' Donald Trump\n\nWrestling great Hulk Hogan told Fox News' Bret Baier on Thursday what compelled him to publicly support former President Donald Trump.\n\nHogan adds some pop culture pizzazz to the speakers' lineup on the final night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nWell Bret, I got tired of remaining silent. I sat back and watched the borders collapse, I watched the economy collapse - the price of gas, the price of food - everything doing just an upside-down flip.\n\nAnd when they took a shot at my hero Donald Trump I realized that I couldn't be silent anymore.\n\nOn Saturday, Hogan posted the now iconic picture of Trump, fist-up, with blood splattered across his face after would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks fired in the former president's direction grazing his ear.\n\nWell, it rattled me to my core when this happened. And when I saw him stand up with that fist in the air and the blood on his face as a warrior, as a leader, I realized that's what America needs. I knew it all along. I was just afraid to speak out, but when I saw that, it just made me realize that is the leader that this country needs to get back on track.\n\nHogan also said his convention speech will be akin to 'body-slamming the Giant at WrestleMania.'\n\nDavid Axelrod: 'The president knows how to read these numbers and he'll make a decision that he thinks is best'\n\nDavid Axelrod, the mastermind behind Barack Obama's two election victories and one of the loudest voices calling for Biden to step aside, is at the Republican convention.\n\nHe had his phone glued to his ear just now as he entered the bathroom. What can he have been talking about.\n\nHe stopped to talk to the Daily Mail and said the president would know how to read the numbers being presented to him about his chances in the election.\n\nI think obviously there have been a lot of conversations and everybody's aware of the trend lines and the president is a very experienced and practised politician and he knows how to read these numbers and he'll make a decision that he thinks is best.\n\nHe was cautious about reporting that Biden could pull out of the race this weekend.\n\nI've seen those reports. But I think everybody understands this is not an easy process.\n\nPastor Lorenzo Sewell gets roaring support from MAGA crowd: 'Only God knew there would be a miracle by a millimeter'\n\nDetroit Pastor Lorenzo Sewell got the MAGA crowd fired up in Fiserv Forum, especially as he thanked God for sparing Donald Trump's life 'by a millimeter.'\n\nPresident Trump came to the hood because he cares about everyday average Americans. He came to my church. Prayer is preventative and proactive.\n\nOnly thirty days later after we prayed for him there was a miracle by a millimeter. God is good. President Trump will make America secure again. If Donald Trump moved just a millimeter, he would not be here today to make America Great Again.\n\nGod's providence is his ability to do what he wants, when he wants for you. Be strong in his almighty power. Could it be that Jesus Christ preserved him for this moment in time? Could it be that the Lord saved Donald Trump for a time such as this?\n\nFormer State Sec. Mike Pompeo said it is 'so dangerous' Biden 'can't handle a 3 a.m. phone call\n\nA slimmed-down and tanned Mike Pompeo contrasted the former president's foreign policy results to Biden's in his address.\n\n'There were no new American wars. Our southern border closed. Here's another fun fact, we never lost our Secretary of Defense for two weeks either,' the former secretary of state told the crowd, referring to Defense Sec. Lloyd Austin's five-day unannounced absence.\n\n'You'll remember for those four years, the evil of Vladimir Putin was held at bay. When we walked out, January 2021, the Iranian regime was afraid, and the people of Israel were strong and secure.'\n\n'As an Army veteran, I want to speak to everybody who served in Afghanistan.

However, their appearance in the campaign on Thursday answered all the questions. The family is the heart of the Republican Party more than ever before.\n\nMoreover, politics has turned into a family affair, and the Trumps have considerable involvement in political affairs.\n\nThis can be witnessed in the recent events of the Republican Party. Lara Trump, Eric's wife, spoke Tuesday as the co-chair of the Republican Party. Donald Trump Jr.'s teenage daughter, Kai, spoke Wednesday night, after the younger Trump's longtime fianc\u00e9e, Kimberly Guilfoyle. Tiffany Trump, Trump's younger daughter, was in the audience on Monday.\n\nNevertheless, the former president's wife and daughter, Ivanka, were not seen at the events held before Thursday. Barron Trump, 18, has not appeared in the family seats Thursday night.\n\nAdditionally, Melania's last known appearance with Trump was when they went together to cast their primary ballots on Super Tuesday in March.\n\nMeanwhile, Ivanka Trump mentioned that she will not be involved in the campaigns like she was in 2016 and 2020.

Two days earlier, he was wounded when a gunman opened fire at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, killing one spectator and injuring others.\n\nKelly said that Melania's statement following the incident seemed to have been created by AI.\n\n\"The only words Melania has so far uttered on the subject of the violent attempt on her husband's life have been via a written statement shared on social media -- one that had a distinct whiff of the ChatGPT (not to mention the Google Translate) about it,\" Kelly wrote in her column.\n\nChatGPT is an artificial intelligence-powered language model created by OpenAI, an AI and research company. It was first released publicly in November 2022. It can answer questions and craft short essays based on human prompts.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's representatives via email for comment.\n\nMelania, who has kept a low public profile since leaving the White House, released a rare public statement after her husband's injury.\n\nShe urged Americans not to \"forget that differing opinions, policy, and political games are inferior to love\" and that \"we are all humans, and fundamentally, instinctively, we want to help one another\" because \"love, compassion, kindness and empathy are necessities.\"\n\n\"And let us remember that when the time comes to look beyond the left and the right, beyond the red and the blue, we all come from families with the passion to fight for a better life together, while we are here, in this earthly realm,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Dawn is here again. Let us reunite... Ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence.\"\n\nKelly told Newsweek she had been \"intrigued\" not only by Melania's statement but Trump's relationship with women, which she believed was different from what people expected.\n\n\"I loved the statement, and I do think it was ChatGPT aided because of the odd syntax, but I respected it...and I quite like her saying about love being more important than political difference,\" Kelly said, adding that it was an important call for unity at a time of heightened political tensions.\n\nAs for the \"dynamic\" between Trump and his wife, Kelly described it as interesting because \"of his [derogatory] comments about women and allegations of sexual assault, he is obviously seen as someone who doesn't respect women very much.\n\n\"You would expect him to marry someone meek, but I find it really interesting that he's chosen someone in Melania who is so independent and has her own mind,\" she said.\n\nElsewhere in the column, Kelly pointed to the fact that the couple are rarely seen together in public.\n\n\"Melania has shown up to none of Trump's recent court appearances, and virtually none of his campaign events. I've lost track of the number of times I've seen her turn her head when her husband tries to kiss her, or that her facial expression has given away her lack of interest in one of the rare appearances she has deigned to make,\" Kelly wrote.\n\nBut in a further explanation to Newsweek, Kelly argued: \"I think Melania is a very devoted mother\" to their 18-year-old son, Barron, and \"that's why she doesn't turn up to a lot of stuff.\"\n\nShe concluded the column by describing how she had spotted Melania in person at Mar-a-Lago earlier this year.\n\n\"Melania walked by to get to the spa -- the only route from her living quarters -- in a full face of make-up, her hair freshly blow-dried. What a chore, I thought, to constantly have to be so aware of your appearance,\" Kelly wrote. \"But I did not pity her. 'People think and talk about me like: Oh, Melania, oh poor Melania. Don't feel sorry for me,' she once said -- rather threateningly, I fancied. I wouldn't dare.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shannon_power@newsweek.com", "name": "Shannon Power", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

He joined PEOPLE in 2024. His work has previously appeared in The Berkshire Eagle and Luxe Interiors + Design.\n\nMelania Trump made her first appearance at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday, July 18, as the GOP rallied behind her husband, Donald Trump.\n\nHer convention debut comes after the former first lady's notable absence during the first three of days at the RNC -- even as Trump's running mate, Ohio senator J.D. Vance, was spotted with his wife, Usha, on the convention floor.\n\nThe first lady only joined the Trumps in the auditorium for the lead-up to Donald's speech at the end of the program, but off-stage a short time earlier, she was photographed standing behind her husband while he signed his official nomination paperwork.\n\nAs is customary for the spouses of presidential candidates, Melania, now 54, gave speeches at the RNC in 2016 and 2020 -- though in a break of tradition, she was not on the slate of speakers for this year's gathering.\n\nThe former first lady has been absent for much of her husband's third presidential campaign, which he launched in November 2022. When Melania was asked whether she would make more campaign trail appearances after appearing at the polls to vote in Florida's Republican primary, she simply responded, \"Stay tuned.\"\n\nFor months, sources have told PEOPLE that Melania has attempted to remove herself from her husband's political appearances, particularly amid his Manhattan criminal trial, which centered around his concealment of a hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels.\n\n\"It is not comfortable for her,\" one source told PEOPLE last year.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nFollowing the assassination attempt on the former president, however, Melania released one of her most prominent public statements since her husband left office in 2021, calling for a world where \"respect is paramount, family is first, and love transcends.\"\n\n\"We are all humans, and fundamentally, instinctively, we want to help one another,\" wrote Melania. \"American politics are only one vehicle that can uplift our communities.

He has asked for unity in the wake of this attack.\n\n\"I'm not supposed to be here tonight,\" Mr. Trump said, which made the crowd of thousands chant: \"Yes you are!\"\n\n\"We rise together or we fall apart,\" Mr. Trump said at the top of his speech. \"I am running to be president for all of America -- not half of America -- because there is no victory in winning for half of America.\" He said he came to deliver \"a message of confidence, strength, and hope.\"\n\n\"So many people have asked me: 'What happened?'\" Trump said. He added that he would only tell the story of the attempted assassination once, because it was\n\n\"Too painful to tell.\"\n\n\"It was a warm, beautiful day in the early evening ... music was loudly playing, and the campaign was doing really well. I went to the stage and the crowd was cheering wildly,\" \"whizzing sound\" \"I said to myself: 'Wow, what was that?'\"\n\n\"My hand was covered with blood. I immediately knew it was very serious, that we were under attack. Very brave secret service agents. I felt very safe because I had God on my side.\"\n\nFormer first lady Melania Trump has joined her husband at the Republican National Convention ahead of his address accepting the party's nomination for president. It is Mrs. Trump's first public political appearance in months.\n\nShe has largely been absent from the public eye since leaving the White House in 2021, and makes history this year as the first spouse of a presidential candidate to not address the party convention since 1992.\n\nMrs. Trump has attended none of her husband's rallies since he announced his candidacy in late 2022, nor did she accompany him to any of his court appearances in recent months.\n\nThe former first lady walked into the convention hall on Thursday night just before her husband took the stage to accept the nomination. She entered the room after missing the first three days wearing a red dress, accompanied by classical music.\n\nAfter the attempt on her husband's life on Saturday, Mrs. Trump issued a lengthy statement about how impacted she and her son Barron -- the only child she shares with the former president -- were.\n\n\"When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron's life, were on the brink of devastating change. I am grateful to have brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband,\" she wrote in her statement on Sunday.\n\nHer most high-profile event since leaving the White House was attending the funeral of former first lady Rosalyn Carter, where she was joined by all living first ladies, along with President Biden and President Clinton. According to the New York Times, Mrs. Trump and first lady Jill Biden have remained in touch since 2021, going so far as to exchange birthday cards.\n\nAfter his call for unity and the recounting of his brush with death, Trump laid the gauntlet down for Democrats, demanding the indictments levied against him be dropped, especially in the wake of Judge Aileen Cannon's decision to throw out the classified documents case on the grounds that Special Counsel Jack Smith was appointed improperly.\n\n\"If Democrats want to unify our country, they should drop these partisan witch hunts.\" Trump demanded an election that is \"worthy of our people\" be held without any legal issues hanging over him.\n\nWithout mentioning President Biden by name -- referring only to \"the administration\" -- Trump argued that there are a number of crises facing America that demand immediate action by him and him alone.\n\n\"We are a nation in decline,\" the former -- and likely future -- president warned. He listed inflation, the immigration crisis that has brought \"misery, poverty, crime, and disease\", and a series of international conflicts that \"a world has seldom been part of.\"\n\nTrump made the promise to \"drill, baby, drill\" and lower tax rates. The reforms in his own tax reform bill, signed in 2017, expire next year, and will be a key legislative battle in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_rice@nysun.com", "name": "Matthew Rice", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalynn_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rosalynn Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.nysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/trump-speech-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=fill&fm=jpg&fl=progressive", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

When he kissed the fireman's helmet of Corey Comperatore, the husband and father who was killed during the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, last weekend, he created an indelible image. The Trump who appeared on stage was humble, gracious, contemplative.\n\nThen, a half hour into the speech, Trump began to improvise. He talked. And talked. He was the Trump we are used to seeing on the campaign trail: garrulous and sarcastic, cracking jokes, championing his record, describing goals for a second term. At length. The speech must have set a record for longest convention address. If Trump wanted to prove he could speak with greater passion and for a longer period of time than President Biden, he did so. He also left this television viewer exhausted.\n\nThe Trump who spoke for 91 minutes on Thursday evening was a slightly more subdued version of the man who has been at the center of politics for almost a decade. Yet much of the convention was spent trying to convince Americans that Trump is more than the person they've watched on the news since 2015.\n\nFor example, one day after an assassin's bullet narrowly missed Donald Trump, Trump's wife Melania released a letter to the American public. In an appeal to our shared humanity, the former first lady described a side of her husband that is often hidden from the outside world.\n\n\"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion -- his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,\" she wrote. \"The core facets of my husband's life -- his human side -- were buried below the political machine.\"\n\nMelania's words set the tone for the Republican convention. Her distinction between Trump the \"political machine\" and Trump the human being framed the week's proceedings. For the past nine years, America and the world have become well acquainted with the machine: Trump's strong rhetoric, his mean tweets, his combativeness, his insults and sarcasm. The convention showcased, in the aftermath of the assassination attempt, a new dimension to Trump's personality: his friendliness, paternal manner, emotion, vulnerability.\n\nI wasn't the only person who noticed that, as he sat watching speeches from the presidential box, Trump seemed calmer, more serene than ever before. His expression embodied what we kept hearing from the rostrum. Political figures such as Nikki Haley, Kellyanne Conway, and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R., Ark.) described Donald Trump behind the scenes. They mentioned his kindness, generosity, and grit.\n\nTrump's friend and fellow real estate developer Steve Witkoff described how Trump reassured him after one of his sons died of a drug overdose. UFC head honcho Dana White read a portion from a text message that Trump sent him recently expressing regret that the RNC overlapped with a White family vacation. And Trump's 17-year-old granddaughter Kai won the audience over with her line, \"To me, he's just a normal grandpa. He gives us candy and soda when our parents aren't looking. He always wants to know how we're doing in school.\"\n\nNot only was Trump different this week. The Republican Party was too. The previous conventions at which Trump was nominated were marred by division and distraction. Four years ago, the pandemic scrambled both party conventions. Eight years ago, the Republican Party remained divided over Trump. Not anymore. This was the most unified, energetic GOP convention in 20 years, maybe longer.\n\nTrump overhauled the Republican National Committee, installing his daughter-in-law and two key operatives. He wrote and edited the party platform, boiling down a lengthy consensus document into 16 pages and 20 bullet points laying out his goals and aligning the party infrastructure with his views on immigration, trade, Social Security and Medicare, and abortion. He chose a running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (Ohio), who has done more than anyone to provide policy substance to \"Trumpism\" and who, at age 39, will play a role in American politics for many years to come. And he's brought into the party more non-college-educated voters of every race and ethnicity, diversifying the GOP in ways his opponents never thought possible.\n\nBy the time the red, white, blue, and gold balloons fell from the rafters of the Fiserv Forum, there was no doubt that Donald Trump has revamped the Republican Party in his image. This united and energetic party believes that it is on the verge of a great victory. It left Milwaukee in a state of excitement. While, in a basement in Delaware, the Democratic Party is in a state of crisis.", "source": {"uri": "freebeacon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Free Beacon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_continetti@freebeacon.com", "name": "Matthew Continetti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Huckabee_Sanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

For all the effort on the left to dehumanize Trump, the grandchildren are clearly very comfortable around \"grandpa,\" which suggests Trump spends a fair amount of time with them. It's also clear that they love him, as seen when 17-year-old granddaughter Kai Trump stole the show Wednesday night.\n\n\"Grandpa, you are such an inspiration and I love you,\" Kai told him.\n\nTrump sat Eric's wife, Lara Trump, and their children, Carolina, 4, and Luke, 6, as his son spoke. Carolina spent much of the time in her grandfather's lap.\n\nThe former president was also joined by his wife and former First Lady Melania Trump, who made a grand entrance into the arena, and his children, including Don Jr., Ivanka, and Tiffany. Interestingly, Trump would later reference his 18-year-old son Barron being there, but he was not seen on camera.\n\nBut the images of Carolina sitting in Trump's lap melted away 8-plus years of demonization by Democrats and the liberal media in an instant -- a scene any doting grandparent can relate to with great fondness.\n\nA beaming Melania Trump looked \"breathtaking\" on the final night of the convention, wearing a red dress and waving to the crowd as she made her way to the guest-of-honor section set aside for the Trump family, as seen here:\n\nAfter delivering his speech, Trump was joined by his entire family on stage as they celebrated his official acceptance of the Republican presidential nomination:\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Vance's wife, Usha Vance, as the politicians signed paperwork accepting their party's nomination.\n\nDonald would later take the stage to raucous applause at the convention, giving a shoutout to his wife and children - including Tiffany Trump, who was also dressed in white as she sat next to her older sister - in a rambling finale to four days of Republican grandstanding.\n\nFour years ago, this wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary. But Ivanka's public show of support has come after she and her husband, Jared Kushner, \"ghosted\" her father at the end of his first term.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9honey, subscribe to our newsletter here.\n\nIn fact, Ivanka's presence at the RNC marked her first official political appearance since her father's first presidency ended in January 2021.\n\nWhile Ivanka, unlike at the 2020 and 2016 conventions, did not give a speech in support of her father, she did take the stage at the conclusion of the event, standing next to her father and Melania.\n\nSmiling, waving and blowing kisses to the packed crowds, you'd be forgiven for forgetting Ivanka's previous assertion she would be stepping away from politics.\n\n\"I love my father very much. This time around I am choosing to prioritise my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics,\" Ivanka wrote in a statement published by CNN minutes after Donald announced he would be running again for the White House in November 2022.\n\n\"While I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena. I am grateful to have had the honour of serving the American people and I will always be proud of many of our Administration's accomplishments.\"\n\nIvanka, who served as a full-time adviser to her father from March 2017 until the conclusion of his first presidency, kept true to her word in the years following, notably missing the first three days of the RNC earlier this week.\n\nShe did, however, issue a statement in support of her father following the attempt on his life at a rally over the weekend, writing on Instagram: \"Thank you for your love and prayers for my father and for the other victims of today's senseless violence in Butler, Pennsylvania.\"\n\n\"I am grateful to the Secret Service and all other law enforcement officers for their quick and decisive actions today. I continue to pray for our country,\" she continued.\n\n\"I love you Dad, today and always.\"\n\nDays later, her brother, Eric, confirmed Melania and Ivanka would both be making rare public appearances at the convention.\n\n\"They're coming in and they're coming in full force and effect, so they'll certainly be here. Ivanka has been an incredible supporter of my father,\" Eric told CBS Mornings on Wednesday (Thursday in Australia).\n\nHe claimed \"there's no family in political history that has remained closer.\"\n\nIvanka's public show of political support for her father to some who watched how she responded to the final weeks of her father's presidency - which was clouded in controversy - may be surprising. To others, it's not.\n\n\"Ivanka and Jared... have always (always!) tried to have it both ways,\" a scathing analysis published by CNN in 2021 read.\n\n\"Yes, they are related to Donald Trump - and, yes, they want all the benefits and access that comes with that.

Jared and Ivanka still want to be liked by the intelligentsia.\n\n\"They want to have access to important places and travel in the circles of the wealthy and well-connected.\n\n\"In short: Jared and Ivanka wanted all the benefits of being in the Trump orbit with none of the downside.\"", "source": {"uri": "honey.nine.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "honey.nine.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivana_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivana Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

(Barron Trump, Donald Trump's son with Melania, did not appear, but assorted grandchildren did.)\n\nShe walked in alone, in a red suit and towering red heels, hair down, bestowing queenly waves on an adoring crowd.\n\nIf the suit struck a chord, that may be because it had been seen before. Mrs. Trump had worn the ensemble -- from Dior, with a New Look silhouette -- in 2017, when, as first lady, she visited Paris with her husband for the Bastille Day celebrations. For anyone who remembers that suit, seeing it again was like sliding down a wormhole to the recent past when the Trumps occupied the White House -- a further reminder, like the virtual White House projected behind Mr. Trump as he made his speech, of the point of the whole shebang.\n\nMrs. Trump was offering something of a preview of how she may again play her part. (Not to mention the fact that, despite Mr. Trump's statements about manufacturing in America and buying American, she has never seemed all that interested in that idea.)\n\nIt was a reminder, really, of just how formidable an accessory the former first lady can be when she so desires: both in the art of image-creation and in the game.\n\nAccessories have been something of a thing, at this convention. Outr\u00e9 details are always part of the scene -- the Wisconsin cheese hats, the Texas Stetsons, the creative uses of stars and stripes -- but this time, more than most, they have played an outsize role, thanks largely to the white gauze bandage over Mr. Trump's ear.\n\nAs much as a protective covering, the bandage was a symbol, if any were needed, of the assassination attempt at a rally last Saturday, an event that Mr. Trump recounted somberly at the beginning of his speech. It became a repository of emotions and meaning for the watching crowd: a sign of their candidate's \"defiance\"; of his sacrifice; of, as speaker after speaker said beforehand, his God-given rescue. And it became not a rallying cry, but a rallying accessory.\n\n(It also became, to Trump skeptics, an object of suspicion, with numerous commentators on social media questioning its validity.)\n\nThe bandage appeared on Day 1 of the convention, and by Day 2, a few attendees were sporting makeshift white rectangles of their own. By Day 3, free ear patches were being handed out outside the convention site, and faux bandages had become a trend -- a sign of \"love,\" one attendee said. By Day 4, wearing a bandage had become a meme, with a video comparing it to the lemming-like high school trends satirized in \"Mean Girls.\"\n\n\"Everybody in the world is going to be wearing these pretty soon,\" a delegate told CBS News.\n\nStill, no one wore their bandage with as much aplomb as Mr. Trump himself, from beginning to end. That was when the Trump family, as well as Senator J.D. Vance and his wife, Usha, joined Mr. Trump onstage to wave to the crowd, a picture of unity so patriotically color coordinated, it was the fashion equivalent of talking points.\n\nThere was Mr. Trump in his signature blue suit, crisp white shirt and bright red tie -- and there was everyone else in variations on the theme.\n\nNot only was Mrs. Trump in red, but so were Mrs. Vance and Ms. Guilfoyle. Ivanka wore a white skirt suit, and Tiffany wore trousers. In blue suits: all the Trump men and Mr. Vance, who -- like his running mate and like Eric -- wore red ties.\n\nThe one exception, Lara Trump, the Republican National Committee co-chair, wore a black suit. But it didn't negate the effect, especially as red, white and blue balloons, accentuated by gold, rained from the ceiling.\n\nMr. Trump has always understood the promise implicit in his tendency to dress \u00e0 la flag, the association of self with country that it connotes. With his family arrayed around him in matching outfits, he took the image to the next level.\n\nIt left a final picture that recalled nothing so much as a family greeting card, the \"Trumpomania\" version (to quote Hulk Hogan, who spoke at the convention just before Mr. Trump). Albeit one sent out to the world.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dior", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiserv_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiserv Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Guilfoyle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Guilfoyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Kushner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jared Kushner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastille_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bastille Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silhouette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_accessory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion accessory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lara Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

He only referred to his political foe, President Biden, by name once -- but avoided any of the sneering nicknames he has used to denounce the president in the past, such as \"Crooked Joe.\"\n\nInstead, he spoke to the nation about the need for \"unity\" and recounted how Saturday's events impacted him as he laid out a path forward for America. It was his first public address since surviving the assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania last Saturday.\n\n\"I stand before you this evening with a message of confidence, strength, and hope,\" Trump began. \"Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.\"\n\n\"The discord and division in our society must be healed. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart,\" he said, noting that he's running for \"all\" of America in his unification call.\n\nHis entrance onto the stage was marked with rapturous applause from the RNC delegates, who were packed in tight into the convention hall.\n\nHe recalled in chilling detail the moment he was shot on Saturday, describing how he heard the \"loud whizzing\" of the bullet and how \"blood was pouring everywhere.\"\n\n\"The amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassin's bullet would have perfectly hit its mark, and I would not be here tonight,\" he said.\n\n\"None of us knows God's plan, or where life's adventure will take us. But if the events of last Saturday make anything clear, it is that every single moment we have on earth is a gift from God. We have to make the most of every day for the people and country we love,\" he continued.\n\nIn a surprise, touching moment, Trump kissed the helmet of former fire chief Corey Comperatore, who was tragically killed by a stray bullet fired by the gunman, Thomas Crooks, at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe former president's family -- including his wife Melania and his daughter Ivanka -- supported him from the VIP box to see him officially accept the GOP nomination in front of the thousands of voters packed into the Milwaukee arena.\n\nTrump had watched the earlier speeches from the box sitting next to country music star Jason Aldean, who headlined a concert after the conclusion of the GOP fest.\n\n\"I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania. Thank you, Melania, and thank you also for your beautiful letter to America calling for national unity,\" Trump said, before lovingly thanking the rest of his family.\n\nThe 45th president had \"tore up\" the prepared speech he had after being shot on Saturday at his rally, his spokesperson told reporters Thursday morning. The new speech was much more \"personal\" and was written by Trump himself.\n\nThe RNC crowd also showed their support for Trump all week, wearing white bandages on their ears in a sign of solidarity for the former president, whose right ear has been wrapped tightly in gauze.\n\nDuring his speech, the thousands of delegates were attentive and enthusiactic, cheering and chanting throughout.\n\nTrump vowed to end Russia's war on Ukraine, end inflation, end \"every single international crisis that the current administration has created.\"\n\nHe also vowed to end the \"illegal immigration crisis.\"\n\nHe said another Trump presidency would unleash a \"Golden Age\" in the US that would include a new \"Iron Dome Missile Defense System to ensure that no enemy can strike our homeland,\" clean cities and American innovation so great the country would \"soon be on the verge of finding the cures to cancer, Alzheimer's, and many other diseases.\"\n\nThe promised to \"bring back the American Dream.\"\n\n\"With great humility, I am asking you to be excited about the future of our country,\" Trump pleaded.\n\nAnd in a final argument, Trump turned to the need for unity once more.\n\n\"We are Americans. Ambition is our heritage. Greatness is our birthright,\" Trump said. \"But as long as our energies are spent fighting each other, our destiny will remain out of reach. We must instead take that energy and use it to realize our country's true potential -- and write our own thrilling chapter of the American Story.\n\n\"Tonight, I ask for your partnership, for your support, and I am humbly asking for your vote. Every day, I will strive to honor the trust you have placed in me, and I will never let you down.\"\n\nThe night, themed around \"Make American Great Again,\" also took a personal tone, as it featured a slate of speakers who are close to the former president, with many of them knowing him personally.\n\nThe list of speakers included Trump's longtime friends Steven and Zach Witkoff, his former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his son Eric Trump. Many speeches mentioned Trump's golf game.\n\nSteven Witkoff, a New York City-based real estate investor, painted Trump as \"a kind and compassionate man\" and described all the times the former president was there was his family even when he \"has everything to lose and nothing to gain.\"\n\nOther speakers included media personality Tucker Carlson, professional wrestler Hulk Hogan and Trump's lawyer Alina Habba. Kid Rock had a musical number with a Trump theme.\n\nHabba's voice broke when she described Trump as \"her friend\" in her emotion-laden speech about her close relationship with her client and his love for music and people.\n\nMelania's presence was especially notable, as she hasn't been with Trump throughout the 2024 campaign and has mostly stayed out of the public eye.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the convention, Trump and Vance will head to their first rally together on Saturday, addressing voters in Michigan, before going to Middletown, Ohio, on Monday -- the senator's hometown.\n\nTrump's team hopes to leverage Vance's Ohio Rust Belt background to win over swing states and traditionally Democrat voters across the Midwest.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com",

For the final night of the Republican National Convention, the former First Lady, who has been mostly away from the spotlight since leaving office, made a grand appearance. Melania turned heads as she proudly supported her husband. However, her encouragement for Donald's presidential campaign didn't involve a kiss.\n\nThursday night was the climax of the four-day RNC event, where Former President Trump officially accepted the Republican presidential nomination. To cap off the big night, the politician gave a lengthy speech, which ended with a surprise appearance on stage from his First Lady. Melania was a sight to behold in a bright red skirt-suit ensemble as she walked graciously across the stage to embrace her husband. Donald seemed taken aback to see his wife of 19 years before pulling her close for a hug and kiss. However, what was supposed to be an affectionate moment spun a meme when Melania dodged Donald's kiss.\n\nFans can see the moment when he tries to kiss Melania on the lips, but she swerves and turns a cheek instead. The former model, however, puts on a smile and proceeds to link arms with her husband as they wave to the crowd while the rest of the Trumps finally joined them on stage. The former first couple is not usually affectionate with each other, so this was a change. However, netizens didn't appreciate it much.\n\nThe video of the interaction has since gone viral, with viewers sharing their thoughts. \"Melania Trump turning her head to avoid a kiss from The Donald has to be the number one moment,\" wrote one follower. Another penned:\n\n\"@MELANIATRUMP won't even allow @realDonaldTrump to kiss her on the lips, but sure you want us to trust this motherf**ker again with the Oval Office? GTFOH!\"\n\nA third comment read, \"You have to feel a little sorry for Melania Trump. She is clearly an unhappy woman. Her smile looks forced and she turns her head when big old Don goes to kiss her. Very sad.\" A fourth fan added, \"That kiss was so awkward. Lol.

Vance -- whom Donald Trump announced as his running mate on Monday -- to Congressman Matt Gaetz. One notable exception, though, was former first lady Melania Trump, who was conspicuously missing the first three days of the RNC.\n\nTonight Melania is scheduled to join her husband in Milwaukee as he formally accepts the Republican nomination, but her absence for most of the RNC feels like a continuation of her legacy as first lady. Her predecessors Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Laura Bush all carved out distinct (if intentionally anodyne) policy areas during their husbands' time in office -- even the fiercest critics of the Bush administration could find little to criticize in Laura's pro-kids-reading message -- but Melania's impact on the Trump White House was both harder to parse and easier to distill to a series of -- for lack of a better term -- incredibly weird viral moments, from her questionable campaign against bullying, to that infamous \"I Really Don't Care\" jacket and her Christmas-decoration fiasco of 2020.\n\nMelania had more reason that usual to stay out of the spotlight this week, given her husband faced an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last Saturday, but I still find myself wondering -- as I inevitably do whenever she enters the news cycle -- just what her PR strategy is. At times, the 54-year-old former model appears to be attempting to telegraph a deliberately remote, inaccessible persona, wearing black for both her final appearance as first lady, during President Joe Biden's inauguration, and her return to the campaign spotlight at the Log Cabin Republicans' fundraiser in April 2024; and her recent public comments after Trump's shooting were strange and disjointed enough to spark speculation that they were written by AI. (While a less-than-polished statement is perhaps to be expected in the wake of something as distressing as a spouse's attempted murder, it is, ironically, difficult to see Melania repeatedly referring to Trump's \"human side\" as anything other than robotic.)\n\nIt's been theorized that Melania had little interest in returning to the White House if Trump were reelected in 2024, and now that the couple's 18-year-old son Barron is off to college, there would seem to be less incentive than ever for Melania to help her husband project the kind of happy-family image that has traditionally been required of the First Family. If the first lady has long functioned as a kind of water mark against which all other forms of American womanhood are measured (especially among the \"family values\"-minded conservative set), though, then what can we infer from Melania's absence -- not just from the majority of the RNC, but from much of her husband's campaign in general? (Compare her to, say, Jill Biden.) It's tempting to interpret Melania's relatively reduced role in Trump's reelection effort as evidence of her husband's fundamental, much-remarked-on misogyny -- though the actual logic behind Trump's campaign decisions is often largely obscure.", "source": {"uri": "vogue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "British Vogue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vogue.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Gaetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The famous New York Times picture now where you literally see the vapor trail of the bullet coming out of the backside of his ear. It's hard to believe it could've been so much different. I can't even imagine what that would've meant for this country,\" Eric Trump said.\n\nEric Trump said the former president's hearing is fine and that he is \"in great spirits.\"\n\nAsked about the recent revelation that U.S. intelligence had also detected an Iranian plot against his father, Eric Trump did not seem surprised.\n\n\"We've been hearing this from Iran, including from the leaders directly, for years at this point,\" he said. Eric Trump cited the assassinations of Qassem Soleimani, the former leader of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's Quds forces, and former ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as reasons why Iran would want retribution against the former president.\n\nEric Trump didn't provide any details about security changes since the assassination attempt, but he did praise the response by Secret Service agents who protected his father on stage Saturday. Still, he wants accountability for the failures that led to the shooting.\n\n\"The men and women on that stage in that moment are the greatest people in the world,\" Eric Trump said. \"I know many of them personally and they're phenomenal, phenomenal individuals. And I'm sure they'll get to the bottom of it, but there'd better be real accountability. You can't have ex-presidents taking bullets through the ear.\"\n\nHe said the fact that snipers and rally attendees spotted the shooter as early as 26 minutes before the first shots were fired is \"infuriating.\"\n\n\"I grew up competing in the shooting sports. I know that world very, very well, and a rifle shot at 130 yards is like a four-inch punt, right? You don't, you don't miss it if you're competent,\" he said, adding, \"I'm not an overly mushy person ... but, you know, somebody was watching down on him because it could have gone very, very differently.\"\n\nEric Trump said it was \"hard to believe\" the Secret Service would overlook a building as large as the one the gunman used to gain his vantage point.\n\n\"A big building that size, 130 yards away from a podium, from an elevated position -- you don't need to be a security expert to realize that you might want to have somebody up there.\"\n\nIn the interview, Eric Trump also expressed enthusiasm about his father's vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio. He said he was excited to see Vance take on Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming vice presidential debate, which will be hosted by CBS News.\n\n\"I think JD Vance will be putting a bag of popcorn in the microwave and, you know, he is ready to go,\" Eric Trump said. \"Believe me, he's not gonna be backing away from that debate.

Back in 1992, as their marriage was on the brink, Diana visibly pulled away when Charles attempted a peck after a polo match, resulting in an awkward encounter with her hair instead.\n\nDonald Trump faced his own awkward moment while speaking at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Thursday (July 18). With Melania by his side, supporting him alongside the rest of the Trump family just days after a failed assassination attempt on the Republican candidate, things didn't go as planned.\n\nAs Trump leaned in for a kiss when Melania joined him onstage, she deftly turned her head, leaving Trump to plant one beside her face. Recently, Trump has been giving the public a closer look at his family life, with his eldest granddaughter Kai describing him as a \"normal grandpa\" who \"gave her candy\".\n\nBody language expert Judi James has termed Melania's manoeuvre a \"corrective swerve\". Judi suggests that Melania was aiming to whisper something to her husband rather than share a public kiss, reports the Express.\n\nJudi said: \"Trump's current new mood as a reflective, emotional family man and 'normal grandpa' as Kai so fondly called him, has produced this iconic moment of out-of-kilter choreography as he moves to kiss his wife in a rare PDA and Melania swerves to turn the gesture into a whispering ritual.\n\n\"Melania's careful walk out on stage after the end of his speech appeared to be unnoticed by her husband who was turned to his side and when she held out one arm to touch his torso he acted out a gesture of surprise, reeling back slightly and raising one arm not, thank goodness, in any fear response triggered by his shooting, but in a more good-humoured signal of pleasure.\n\n\"He responded with a reciprocal gesture, putting his arm out around her waist and he motioned to pull her in for a kiss. His lips appeared puckered as he advanced towards her mouth but Melania seemed to perform a 'corrective swerve', (similar to the one Diana did to Charles at polo) pushing her own mouth forward in the direction of his bandaged ear, which is an odd option to whisper into.\"\n\nJudi believes politicians engaging with their spouse on stage is often \"toe-curling\". She does however think the interaction between the pair after the kiss shows the former US President wants to show \"new levels of bonding\" with his wife.\n\nShe added: \"Trump's face disappeared behind hers but he did seem to kiss her cheek fondly and to engage her right ear in conversation. Political spouse kisses at rallies are nearly always toe-curling events but it's odd these two didn't have a small plan in mind or even exchange memos prior to the event.\n\n\"Trump did look genuinely keen to keep Melania close and to register new levels of bonding, reaching out to hold her hand tightly and even pulling her back close to his side and re-clasping her hand when she moved to talk to the new Veep and his wife.\"\n\nSocial media users didn't hold back their thoughts on the Trumps' interaction. A user on X, previously known as Twitter, posted: \"YIKES! Melania Trump completely DODGED Trump's kiss at the end of his RNC speech. Super awkward moment! \".\n\nAnother chimed in: \"She looks like she'd rather be anywhere else on the planet, besides there at that moment...\" And a third sympathised: \"I honestly feel sorry for that poor woman.\"\n\nThe incident occurred shortly after Trump spoke at the RNC, following an attempt on his life. He had been shot at during a rally in Pennsylvania, where his ear was reportedly \"pierced\" by one of the five bullets fired into the crowd.\n\nThe shooting left three people wounded, including Trump, and tragically firefighter Corey Comperatore lost his life.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_jackson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Matt Jackson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_plot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "20 July plot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veep", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veep"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/article33281902.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_donald-trump-kissing-melania-and-charles-with-diana.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 530, "textEnd": 537}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Still, he wants accountability for the failures that led to the shooting.\n\n\"The men and women on that stage in that moment are the greatest people in the world,\" Eric Trump said. \"I know many of them personally and they're phenomenal, phenomenal individuals. And I'm sure they'll get to the bottom of it, but there'd better be real accountability. You can't have ex-presidents taking bullets through the ear.\"\n\nHe said the fact that snipers and rally attendees spotted the shooter as early as 26 minutes before the first shots were fired is \"infuriating.\"\n\n\"I grew up competing in the shooting sports. I know that world very, very well, and a rifle shot at 130 yards is like a four-inch punt, right? You don't, you don't miss it if you're competent,\" he said, adding, \"I'm not an overly mushy person ... but, you know, somebody was watching down on him because it could have gone very, very differently.\"\n\nEric Trump said it was \"hard to believe\" the Secret Service would overlook a building as large as the one the gunman used to gain his vantage point.\n\n\"A big building that size, 130 yards away from a podium, from an elevated position -- you don't need to be a security expert to realize that you might want to have somebody up there.\"\n\nIn the interview, Eric Trump also expressed enthusiasm about his father's vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio. He said he was excited to see Vance take on Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming vice presidential debate, which will be hosted by CBS News.\n\n\"I think JD Vance will be putting a bag of popcorn in the microwave and, you know, he is ready to go,\" Eric Trump said. \"Believe me, he's not gonna be backing away from that debate. That much I can tell you.\"\n\nJordan Freiman\n\nJordan Freiman is a news editor for CBSNews.com. He covers breaking news, trending stories, sports and crime.

The GOP nominee for president of the United States called for unity in his speech, detailed the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, and made clear that we're going to drill, baby, drill.\n\nTrump detailed what took place in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday:\n\nLet me begin this evening by expressing my gratitude to the American people for your outpouring of love and support following the assassination attempt at my rally on Saturday ... I'll tell you what happened, and you'll never hear it from me a second time, because it's too painful to tell.\n\nWatch in full what he said about the assassination attempt:\n\nTrump accepted the GOP nomination to become President of the United States and called for national unity.\n\nI am running to be President for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America. So tonight, with faith and devotion I proudly accept your nomination for President of the United States.\n\nTrump on his wife and the former first lady Melania:\n\nOn this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania. Thank you, Melania, and thank you also for your beautiful letter to America calling for national unity. It captivated so many.\n\nThroughout the RNC, speakers reminded Americans what life was like under the Trump administration, while the Democrats promised the world to voters but failed to deliver on their promises.\n\nThey said that the Republican Party is a big tent party where all are welcome. As the GOP is making gains with Hispanic voters, young voters, and Asian voters, Biden is losing support among their biggest voting bloc, which is black women.\n\nRelated: WATCH: The UFC's Dana White Electrifies the Crowd at the RNC, Says Trump Is the Toughest Guy He Knows\n\nTucker Carlson at RNC: After Assassination Attempt, 'Donald Trump...Became Leader of This Nation'\n\n98-Year-Old WWII Vet Brings the House Down at RNC: If Trump Were President, I Would 'Re-Enlist Today'\n\nMost of the speakers hit the right talking points about policy and stories about Trump for those who watched the convention with an open mind and were undecided or unhappy with the Democratic Party. Hopefully, the GOP will grow, and as long as people get out the vote in droves, they will deliver a win for Trump-Vance, the majority in the Senate, all while maintaining the majority in the House. \"From your lips to god's ears,\" as the old saying goes.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "levon_satamian@redstate.com", "name": "Levon Satamian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_tent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big tent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/200/7512bae6-e5c6-4289-8686-9b7a8f12eaa8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

Tell us what happened, please,'\" Trump said. \"And therefore, I will tell you exactly what happened, and you'll never hear it from me a second time because it's actually too painful to tell.\"\n\nAt one point, an image was projected behind the former president that showed him speaking at the rally on Saturday and a bullet mid-air.\n\n\"Bullets were flying over us, yet I felt serene,\" he said during the speech on Thursday night, adding, \"I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God.\"\n\nThere were huge cheers as the image of Trump, with blood on his face and his fist in the air, was shown on the screen.\n\nTrump also spoke about Corey Comperatore, who was slain at the rally. At one point the former president kissed Comperatore's fireman helmet, which was displayed on stage along with his jacket.\n\nSen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) made his debut as Trump's new running mate -- and had the biggest political stage of his career.\n\nHe used it to share his upbringing as a child in Middletown, Ohio, and his journey to becoming a member of the Senate.\n\n\"Never in my wildest imagination would I have believed that I could be standing here tonight,\" he said at the top of the speech, before going on to describe his hometown as \"a place that had been cast aside and forgotten by America's ruling class in Washington.\"\n\nVance, author of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" sought to use his personal story to paint President Biden as one of the \"out-of-touch politicians in Washington\" whose policies he said hurt his community.\n\nHe was introduced by his wife Usha Vance, who shared personal stories of their life and their marriage.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, this moment is not about me, it's about all of us, and who we're fighting for,\" he said. \"It's about the auto worker in Michigan, wondering why out of touch politicians are destroying your jobs.\"\n\n\"It's about the energy worker in Pennsylvania and Ohio, who doesn't understand why Joe Biden is willing to buy energy from tinpot dictators but not hard-working Americans right here at home.\"\n\nThe Vances were also in the first row of the Trump suite throughout the convention alongside former first lady Melania Trump, his children and grandchildren.\n\nTrump said he's \"thrilled\" to have a new partner by his side. He said Vance will be a \"great\" vice president. He improvised that he and his wife, Usha, were \"great\" students and told Vance that he should \"enjoy the ride.\"\n\nAttendees wear bandages in solidarity with Trump\n\nThe president's supporters have been seen donning bandages on their ears in solidarity with Trump over the past few days.\n\nJoe Neglia, an Arizona delegate that had been one of the earliest attendees seen sporting the look, described the accessory as \"the newest fashion trend\" in remarks to CBS News earlier this week.\n\n\"Everybody in the world is going to be wearing these pretty soon,\" he said. .\n\nHe was at least partially right. More and more attendees joined the trend as the week progressed, drawing widespread attention.\n\nFrom similar white paper taped to their right ears to ones emblazoned with the American flag, the ear coverings kept popping up.\n\nCrowd goes wild for Hulk Hogan\n\nFormer professional wrestler Hulk Hogan dramatically tore his shirt off while speaking to the crowd, calling for \"Trumpamania,\" a play on \"Hulkamania.\"\n\n\"When they tried to kill the next president of the United States, enough was enough, and I said let Trumpamania run wild, brother\" he said to thunderous applause from those in attendance.\n\nHe was a crowd favorite, getting one of the loudest and most enthusiastic responses of any speaker.\n\nThe former professional wrestler, whose legal name is Terry Bollea, first emerged as his Hulk Hogan persona that he used while competing in the ring. A \"USA\" chant broke out immediately when he first came to the podium, and the chant returned again later in his speech.\n\n\"When I came here tonight, there was so much energy in this room, I thought maybe I was in Madison Square Garden getting ready to win another title,\" he said.\n\nMelania makes a rare appearance\n\nFormer first lady Melania Trump also appeared at the convention on Thursday - the only day she was seen in Milwaukee.\n\nDuring his speech, the former president thanked his wife for what he described as her \"beautiful letter to America calling for national unity.\"\n\n\"It captivated so many,\" he said before also thinking \"entire family,\" including, \"Don and Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared, Eric and Lara, Tiffany and Michael, Barron,\" and ten grandchildren.\n\nMelania Trump, donning a red double-breasted suit jacket and skirt, sat in a suite overlooking the convention floor with her stepchildren.\n\nShe later joined Trump onstage where they held hands, where she appeared to tell the former president \"Good job.\"\n\nGaetz taunts McCarthy\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) had one of the most viral moments of the convention, when he taunted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on the floor of the arena.\n\nGaetz, who successfully led an effort to oust McCarthy from the top spot last year, interrupted the former Speaker during an interview on the convention floor and told him he would be \"booed off the stage\" at the RNC if he spoke.\n\nIn response, McCarthy told The Hill Gaetz \"seemed really unhinged.\"\n\n\"You know, I don't know what he was on, but I hope he gets the help that he needs,\" he said. \"But more importantly, I hope the girls get the justice they deserve.\"\n\nMultiple Republicans have taken aim at Gaetz over the episode, with Rep. Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) calling on the Florida congressman to \"show more maturity.\"\n\n\"That's just inappropriate,\" Thomspon told The Hill on the convention floor. \"He needs to conduct himself with some dignity that reflects the House of Representatives.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aris_folley@thehill.com", "name":

Millimeters separated him from life and certain death,\" Lara told the RNC attendees.\n\nShe addressed the assassination attempt on Trump during a campaign rally and painted her father-in-law as a defiant political hero.\n\nIn addition to Trump's family, prominent Republicans are also rallying behind the former president's re-election campaign.\n\nFormer UN Ambassador and presidential candidate, Nikki Haley endorsed Trump on the second day of the RNC - a move that shocked many following her campaign.\n\nNikki was a strong critic of Trump during the primary election cycle but opted to support him in the general election.\n\nThe former South Carolina Governor admitted that she didn't always agree with Trump, but added, \"President Trump asked me to speak to this convention in the name of unity.\n\n\"It was a gracious invitation and I was happy to accept.\"\n\nFBI agents have launched a case into the assassination and have reportedly found images of Trump and President Biden on the gunman's phone.\n\nThe New York Times also reported searches of an unnamed member of the Royal Family on Crooks' phone.\n\nFootage has also recently emerged of the gunman walking near the rally just an hour before opening fire.\n\nAn attendee turned over footage of the crowd which included Crooks walking behind a screen at the rally.\n\nCrooks was positioned on a nearby rooftop about 430 feet away from the stage.\n\nSecret Service snipers shot and killed him 26 seconds after he opened fire.\n\nLaw enforcement spotted him just minutes before he fired his first shots.\n\nSecret Service has taken heat for the incident, resulting in calls for director Kimberly Cheatle to step down.\n\nWhile Republicans are in Milwaukee to formally tap Trump as the presidential nominee, Democrats seem divided over supporting Biden's re-election campaign.\n\nProminent Democrats are also reportedly having those conversations behind closed doors, with several sources close to the president telling Axios that they don't think he can win against Trump in November.\n\nSources also told ABC News that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are considering delaying the Democrat nomination process.\n\nA spokesperson for Schumer responded to the report with a statement saying the senator had already conveyed his views directly to Biden.\n\nCNN has also reported that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a conversation with Biden over negative polling and her concern that Democrats will lose their bid for the House if he stays in the race.\n\nThe most recent report comes from former President Obama, who told allies that Biden's \"path to victory has greatly diminished and he thinks the president needs to seriously consider the viability of his candidacy,\" according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe concerns come as Biden announced on Wednesday that he was diagnosed with Covid-19 and had to cancel campaign events in the battleground state of Nevada.\n\nTrump's camp is capitalizing on the Democratic divide, with his co-campaign manager speculating that Democrats are staging a \"coup\" against Biden.\n\n\"They are actively engaged in an attempt - in my view and a lot of people share this view - in deposing the president of the United States,\" Chris LaCivita told Politico.\n\nThe Democrats must secure their plan and message by the Democratic National Convention, which is set to start on August 19 in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe Republicans have rallied around their message at the RNC, expressing support for Trump and echoing policies on strict immigration and an America-first mentality.\n\nTrump is anticipated to angle his speech on unity and outline his message ahead of the general election.\n\nHe reportedly ripped up his speech after the assassination attempt to focus more on unity and will not mention Biden by name.\n\nDana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, is taking the stage next to introduce the former president.\n\nWhite and Trump are longtime friends, and the UFC tycoon is a strong supporter of Trump's presidency.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sophie_gable@the-sun.com", "name": "Sophie Gable", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political correctness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Tell us what happened, please,'\" Trump said. \"And therefore, I will tell you exactly what happened, and you'll never hear it from me a second time because it's actually too painful to tell.\"\n\nAt one point, an image was projected behind the former president that showed him speaking at the rally on Saturday and a bullet mid-air.\n\n\"Bullets were flying over us, yet I felt serene,\" he said during the speech on Thursday night, adding, \"I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God.\"\n\nThere were huge cheers as the image of Trump, with blood on his face and his fist in the air, was shown on the screen.\n\nTrump also spoke about Corey Comperatore, who was slain at the rally. At one point the former president kissed Comperatore's fireman helmet, which was displayed on stage along with his jacket.\n\n\"What a fine man he was,\" Trump said.\n\nSen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) made his debut as Trump's new running mate -- and had the biggest political stage of his career.\n\nHe used it to share his upbringing as a child in Middletown, Ohio, and his journey to becoming a member of the Senate.\n\n\"Never in my wildest imagination would I have believed that I could be standing here tonight,\" he said at the top of the speech, before going on to describe his hometown as \"a place that had been cast aside and forgotten by America's ruling class in Washington.\"\n\nVance, author of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" sought to use his personal story to paint President Biden as one of the \"out-of-touch politicians in Washington\" whose policies he said hurt his community.\n\nHe was introduced by his wife Usha Vance, who shared personal stories of their life and their marriage.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, this moment is not about me, it's about all of us, and who we're fighting for,\" he said. \"It's about the auto worker in Michigan, wondering why out of touch politicians are destroying your jobs.\"\n\n\"It's about the energy worker in Pennsylvania and Ohio, who doesn't understand why Joe Biden is willing to buy energy from tinpot dictators but not hard-working Americans right here at home.\"\n\nThe Vances were also in the first row of the Trump suite throughout the convention alongside former first lady Melania Trump, his children and grandchildren.\n\nTrump said he's \"thrilled\" to have a new partner by his side. He said Vance will be a \"great\" vice president. He improvised that he and his wife, Usha, were \"great\" students and told Vance that he should \"enjoy the ride.\"\n\nThe president's supporters have been seen donning bandages on their ears in solidarity with Trump over the past few days.\n\nJoe Neglia, an Arizona delegate that had been one of the earliest attendees seen sporting the look, described the accessory as \"the newest fashion trend\" in remarks to CBS News earlier this week.\n\n\"Everybody in the world is going to be wearing these pretty soon,\" he said. .\n\nHe was at least partially right. More and more attendees joined the trend as the week progressed, drawing widespread attention.\n\nFrom similar white paper taped to their right ears to ones emblazoned with the American flag, the ear coverings kept popping up.\n\nFormer professional wrestler Hulk Hogan dramatically tore his shirt off while speaking to the crowd, calling for \"Trumpamania,\" a play on \"Hulkamania.\"\n\n\"When they tried to kill the next president of the United States, enough was enough, and I said let Trumpamania run wild, brother\" he said to thunderous applause from those in attendance.\n\nHe was a crowd favorite, getting one of the loudest and most enthusiastic responses of any speaker.\n\nThe former professional wrestler, whose legal name is Terry Bollea, first emerged as his Hulk Hogan persona that he used while competing in the ring. A \"USA\" chant broke out immediately when he first came to the podium, and the chant returned again later in his speech.\n\n\"When I came here tonight, there was so much energy in this room, I thought maybe I was in Madison Square Garden getting ready to win another title,\" he said.\n\nFormer first lady Melania Trump also appeared at the convention on Thursday - the only day she was seen in Milwaukee.\n\nDuring his speech, the former president thanked his wife for what he described as her \"beautiful letter to America calling for national unity.\"\n\n\"It captivated so many,\" he said before also thanking \"entire family,\" including, \"Don and Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared, Eric and Lara, Tiffany and Michael, Barron,\" and ten grandchildren.\n\nMelania Trump, donning a red double-breasted suit jacket and skirt, sat in a suite overlooking the convention floor with her stepchildren.\n\nShe later joined Trump onstage where they held hands, where she appeared to tell the former president \"Good job.\"\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) had one of the most viral moments of the convention, when he taunted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on the floor of the arena.\n\nGaetz, who successfully led an effort to oust McCarthy from the top spot last year, interrupted the former Speaker during an interview on the convention floor and told him he would be \"booed off the stage\" at the RNC if he spoke.\n\nIn response, McCarthy told The Hill Gaetz \"seemed really unhinged.\"\n\n\"You know, I don't know what he was on, but I hope he gets the help that he needs,\" he said. \"But more importantly, I hope the girls get the justice they deserve.\"\n\nMultiple Republicans have taken aim at Gaetz over the episode, with Rep. Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) calling on the Florida congressman to \"show more maturity.\"\n\n\"That's just inappropriate,\" Thomspon told The Hill on the convention floor. \"He needs to conduct himself with some dignity that reflects the House of Representatives.\"", "source": {"uri": "wfla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFLA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The video has gained substantial attention, with many viewers expressing their opinions on social media.\n\nMany comments highlighted the awkwardness of the moment.\n\nOne user on X (formerly Twitter) remarked, \"YIKES! Melania Trump completely DODGED Trump's kiss at the end of his RNC speech. Super awkward moment!\"\n\nAnother added, \"She looks like she'd rather be anywhere else on the planet, besides there at that moment...\"\n\nThis sentiment resonated with several viewers who felt a sense of discomfort for Melania, with one user stating, \"I honestly feel sorry for that poor woman\".\n\nThe RNC, which is a significant event in American politics, typically features high-profile speeches and moments of celebration. However, this particular incident has garnered more attention than usual, with many people discussing the dynamics between the Trumps.\n\nThe video has become a topic of conversation across various media outlets and social platforms, reflecting the ongoing interest in the Trump family and their public appearances.\n\nMelania's presence at the convention itself was notable, as she had been absent from earlier days, leading to speculation about her role and support for her husband. When she finally appeared, dressed in striking red, she received a warm welcome.\n\nObservers noted that while her presence was celebrated, the kiss incident overshadowed the convention's more serious political discussions, highlighting the ongoing fascination with the Trumps as a public couple.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together or we fall apart.\"\n\n\"I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America,\" he added. \"So tonight, with faith and devotion, I proudly accept your nomination for president of the United States.\"\n\n\"I am not supposed to be here tonight,\" Trump said, as the crowd shouted back, \"Yes you are.\"\n\n\"I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God,\" Trump said. \"In watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a providential moment.\"\n\n\"The crowd was confused because they thought I was dead,\" Trump said. \"And there was great great sorrow. I could see that on their faces as I looked up. They didn't know I was looking out they thought it was over. When I could see it I wanted to do something to let them know I was okay. I raised my right arm looked at the thousands and thousands of people that were breathlessly waiting and started shouting, 'fight, fight, fight.'\n\nEach day of the convention has had a theme; Thursday's is \"Make America Great Once Again.\"\n\nHere's what we know so far (estimated times are in Eastern Standard Time):\n\nFormer President Donald Trump paid tribute to firefighter Corey Comperatore, who was killed in last week's assassination attempt on Trump, calling the Pennsylvania father a \"fine man.\"\n\n\"Tragically, the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans, Corey Comperatore, and seriously wounded two other great warriors, David Dutch and James Copenhaver. I spoke to all three families of these tremendous people -- our love and prayers are with them, and always will be,\" Trump said. \" Corey, a highly respected former fire chief, was accompanied by his wife Helen and two precious daughters. He lost his life selflessly acting as a human shield to protect them from flying bullets. He was such a fine man.\n\nUltimate Fighting Champion CEO Dana White introduced the former president this year, a role previously held by Melania and Ivanka Trump.\n\n\"As an entertainer, I tried to stay out of politics,\" White said. \"But with everything that's happened to our country over the past four years and everything that happened last week, I can no longer stay silent.\"\n\nEric Trump, one of Trump's three sons, took the stage and praised his father's \"unwavering courage\" since the recent attempt on his life, both publicly and in private conversations.\n\nHe highlighted his father's career as a developer in New York, noting how he began building skyscrapers when others were turning away due to rampant crime. Eric also spoke about his father's achievements while in office from 2016 to 2020. \"My father made the United States safe. Our borders were closed. There was peace in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\nRetired pro wrestler Hulk Hogan, once an Obama supporter, made a surprising appearance at the RNC on Thursday, fully endorsing Trump, whom he recently called his \"hero.\" Hogan walked on stage swinging an American flag.\n\n\"You know something, I have had some great tag teams in my time,\" Hogan said. \"But you know something, I see the greatest tag team of my life, standing together, getting ready to straighten this country up.\"\n\nFormer Fox News host Tucker Carlson says that he called Trump hours after Saturday's assassination attempt and the former president didn't talk about himself.\n\n\"He said only how amazed he was and how proud he was of the crowd that didn't run,\" Tucker recounted. \"Of course they didn't run; his courage gave them heart.\"\n\nCarlson also said that Trump didn't try to create division after the attack. \"He turned down the most obvious opportunity to inflame the nation,\" Carlson said.\n\nThe pastor of a Detroit church Trump visited said he came to listen and learn.\n\n\"Could it be that Jesus Christ preserved him for a time such as this?\" Lorenzo Sewell proclaimed. He noted Trump \"came to the hood because he cares about average Americans.\"\n\nFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised the Trump administration's foreign policy, stating, \"We put America first every single day.\" He criticized Biden for the Afghanistan pullout and blamed him for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Gaza's attack on Israel, asserting, \"We can't trust the Biden administration.\"\n\nPompeo, who was also Trump's CIA director and a Kansas congressman, considered running for the GOP nomination but chose not to, citing timing concerns for him and his family.\n\nTrump energized the crowd Monday night in his first public appearance since Saturday's assassination attempt. That day, he chose U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio to be his running mate.\n\nHis former opponents for the GOP nomination also took the stage to show their support.\n\nNikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador who was Trump's final challenger in the GOP primary, directly addressed her supporters after taking the stage to a mix of cheers and boos.\n\n\"My message to them is simple: You don't have to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him,\" Haley said.\n\nShe was followed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a one-time Trump ally turned primary rival who has worked to rebuild his relationship with the former president since dropping out of the primary.\n\n\"Donald Trump has been demonized. He's been sued. He's been prosecuted. And he nearly lost his life,\" DeSantis told the crowd. \"We cannot let him down. And we cannot let America down.\"\n\nSuch overtures are typical in political conventions, where the purpose is often to bring a party together after bitter primaries. But the Haley and DeSantis appearances were particularly notable given the personal animosity that defined this year's GOP contest -- much of that being directed by Trump at Haley and DeSantis.",

She seemed as inscrutable and distant as ever.\n\nEver since her husband was first elected in 2016, Melania Trump has broken all the rules of normal American presidential politics.\n\nIn the White House during Trump's first term, she was a reclusive figure compared to other first ladies, focusing on a narrow set of interests. The US national archives descibes her as having been an \"ambassador for kindness\" and an advocate for children's issues.\n\nAnd since her husband left office, she has refused to be seen by her husband's side on many occasions when the public would expect her to be present.\n\nShe wasn't there when he had his mugshot taken in Atlanta. She wasn't there in New York when he became the first former president to be convicted of a crime. And she wasn't there when he officially won his party's presidential nomination, for the third time, on Monday.\n\n\"Melania does what Melania wants,\" said Mary Jordan, who wrote The Art of her Deal, a biography on the former first lady. \"She is fiercely independent and won't do something just because other people do it.

But I'm ready now.\"\n\nThis is a transformation Trump attributes to his self-described greatest strength: his often-overlooked business acumen.\n\nIndeed, the second Trump son seems to have become the quiet inheritor of his father and grandfather's first and most sacred skill -- the skill that made the entire family famous in the first place.\n\n\"I remember we were in Iowa and everything was moving fast . . . but mostly I remember him [Donald] pulling me aside and saying, 'Hey, I want you to run the company.' And from then on I was fully immersed. Since then I've acquired all our properties, managed all of our teams, and I have to tell you I really found a new love for my life while doing it.\"\n\nTrump said it was an honor to receive the nod to take over from his father, but he also saw the heavy responsibility he was being asked to assume -- a responsibility that shows just how important the new Eric has become to the overall functioning of the ever-expanding Trump ecosystem.\n\n\"Like I said, he makes you work for it,\" he said. \"As he should. Nothing is ever free in life. But at the same time, I don't think anyone has done a better job at protecting his flank, and we recognize that. My father knew he couldn't run a business and lead a nation. For him to trust me with everything he's ever built in his life -- I've never felt more determined to succeed.\"\n\nBut that success was never guaranteed.\n\nTrump said his father was mulling a run in 2012, before eventually doing so and succeeding in 2016, but he didn't feel his family was yet ready for him to step away from the business.\n\n\"Frankly he didn't have faith we could execute yet,\" he said.\n\n\"I knew I had to step up and prove that idea wrong . . . but now I have in my office a framed headline that says 'This is all yours' and a note from my father saying how we are the very best. That was the moment I felt the shift had actually happened, and I knew I'd managed to help take the burden of the business off his shoulders.\"\n\nThat framed story is, of course, from the New York Post.\n\nEric is now the Trump Organization's executive vice president alongside his brother Donald Jr.; he oversees all aspects of management, operation of the global real-estate empire, new project acquisition, developments and construction.\n\nIt's a role his father used to fill -- and built an empire in.\n\nThe son wants to expand that empire to even greater heights. That selflessness is what makes Eric special to his family -- in fact, it's what makes him essential.\n\n\"I have to say, you know you're gonna see me a lot at events and things the next few months but after my father wins if you didn't hear from me or see me again for say a year I'd be just fine,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm much happier chatting with a foreman in a hard hat or helping our cleaning team solve a staffing issue than I am in front of reporters. . . . This is how I can help. This is what I think has made me sort of deadly in this big complicated game. I can switch off. I can work in the background. Make fun of me or hate my family all you want. Because I can't hear you. Because I'm at work.\"\n\nAs a privately held company, the Trump Organization does not release detailed financials or have a trackable stock price. But, it has shown the appearance of notable growth over the last seven years.\n\nSince taking over for his father in January 2017, Eric and his brother have moved ambitiously to grow the company, with notable projects including the $250 million redevelopment of Trump National Doral in Miami, plus the acquisition and renovations of both the Trump International in Ireland and the Trump Turnberry in Scotland.\n\nAsked if he believes he runs the company better than even his father could have, Eric once again demonstrated the surprising lack of ego that's made him such a comforting source of reliability amongst the Trumps.\n\n\"Nobody is better at business than Donald Trump,\" he told The Post.\n\n\"I wouldn't be foolish enough to say I do it better. But what I'll say is It's been a long journey. And I'm happy we're the best we've ever been.\"\n\nEric Trump speaks tonight in Milwaukee just after 9 p.m. Eastern.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dana White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_National_Doral_Miami", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump National Doral Miami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnberry_(golf_course)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnberry (golf course)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Turnberry (golf course)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/85663322.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-01-", "textStart": 4566, "textEnd": 4578}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

On Thursday (July 18) Trump - who, days prior, survived an assassination attempt - accepted the GOP nomination for the third time at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nIn an emotionally-charged speech, he said: \"I am not supposed to be here tonight. I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God. And watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a providential moment. Probably was.\"\n\nWife Melania, 54, was on hand to support her husband as he made his first speech since the attempt on his life on Saturday (July 13). However, critics spotted a rather awkward moment between the couple when Trump appeared to go to kiss his partner.\n\nThe uncomfortable moment came to an end when Melania seemingly rebuffed the ex-President's advances, opting instead for a peck on the cheek. Posting a clip of the cringe-worthy moment, one X (formerly Twitter) user wrote: \"YIKES! Melania Trump completely DODGED Trump's kiss at the end of his RNC speech. Super awkward moment!\"\n\nOthers were quick to comment on the clip in agreement. One wrote: \"She looks like she'd rather be anywhere else on the planet, besides there at that moment..\"\n\nMeanwhile, another agreed: \"I honestly feel sorry for that poor woman.\"\n\nHowever, others suggested the couple could have simply been keeping things professional. One wrote: \"She kissed him. Were they supposed to make out on stage?\"\n\nThe incident comes after five rounds were shot into the crowd at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania. The former President sustained an injury to the ear, saying it was \"pierced\" in the attack.\n\nTwo others were critically injured, while firefighter Corey Comperatore tragically lost his life. In a social media post following the incident, Trump said: \"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin.\"\n\n\"Much bleeding took place.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lizzie_mcallister@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lizzie McAllister", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33279083.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_US-REPUBLICAN-CONVENTION-PARTIES-ELECTION-POLITICS-VOTE-TRUMP.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9739208", "eventUri": "eng-9739208", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 270, "textEnd": 277}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 836, "textEnd": 843}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

It is Mrs. Trump's first public political appearance in months.\n\nShe has largely been absent from the public eye since leaving the White House in 2021, and makes history this year as the first spouse of a presidential candidate to not address the party convention since 1992.\n\nMrs. Trump has attended none of her husband's rallies since he announced his candidacy in late 2022, nor did she accompany him to any of his court appearances in recent months.\n\nThe former first lady walked into the convention hall on Thursday night just before her husband took the stage to accept the nomination.

Eric added that the former president \"has a nice flesh wound,\" calling the injury \"the greatest earache he's ever had.\"\n\nThe businessman added: \"You know, he was millimeters away from having his life expunged ... I'm sure the ear doesn't feel well.\"\n\nIn a Tuesday interview with CBS Evening News, Eric stated that Donald can still hear and is \"in great spirits.\" He also spoke about the shooter avoiding a more lethal shot, saying, \"I grew up competing in the shooting sports. I know that world very, very well, and a rifle shot at 130 yards is like a four-inch punt, right? You don't, you don't miss it if you're competent.\"\n\nThe younger Trump believes his father was lucky in the moment, adding, \"I'm not an overly mushy person ... but, you know, somebody was watching down on him because it could have gone very, very differently.\"\n\nDonald was injured on July 13 after 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at a campaign rally in Butler, Pa., in what authorities have since described as an \"assassination attempt.\"\n\nThe former president spoke to the New York Post about the \"very surreal experience\" the following day, during which he claimed, \"The doctor at the hospital said he never saw anything like this, he called it a miracle.\"\n\nHe added, \"I'm not supposed to be here, I'm supposed to be dead.\"\n\nThree bystanders were also struck during the shooting: Corey Comperatore, 50; David Dutch, 57; and James Copenhaver, 74. Comperatore was killed, while Dutch and Copenhaver were critically injured.\n\nDetailing the events that occurred, Trump wrote on the social media platform Truth Social, \"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin.\" (Investigators have not yet confirmed whether it was a bullet or shrapnel that injured him.)\n\nEarlier this week, the former president appeared at the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee with a large bandage over his injured ear, alongside his newly announced running mate J.D.

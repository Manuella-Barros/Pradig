Hamas truce decision, abide by", "body": "Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said Wednesday his group would accept Palestinian ally Hamas's decision on Gaza truce negotiations, repeating that his movement would stop cross-border attacks on Israel if a ceasefire were reached.\n\nHezbollah has traded almost daily fire with Israeli forces in support of Hamas since the Palestinian militant group's October 7 attack on Israel triggered war in the Gaza Strip, stoking fears of a full-blown conflict.\n\n\"Hamas is negotiating... on behalf of the whole axis of resistance,\" Nasrallah said, referring to regional pro-Iran groups opposed to Israel and the United States.\n\n\"Whatever Hamas accepts, everyone accepts and is satisfied with,\" he said, adding: \"We do not ask (Hamas) to coordinate with us because the battle in the first instance is theirs.\"\n\nNasrallah's remarks came days after he met with a Hamas delegation headed by foreign relations chief Khalil al-Hayya, and as talks were to resume in Qatar towards a truce and hostage release deal in the Gaza war, now grinding into its 10th month.\n\nHamas has signalled that it would drop its insistence on a \"complete\" ceasefire -- which Israel has repeatedly rejected -- as a condition for starting truce talks.\n\nNasrallah repeated his position that \"if a ceasefire is reached, and we all hope for that... our front will cease fire without any discussion\".\n\n\"That is a commitment, because it is a support front and we have been clear (about this) from the start,\" he said, during a televised address commemorating a senior Hezbollah commander killed in an Israeli strike last week.\n\nHowever, Nasrallah warned that \"we will never allow any attack that the Israeli enemy might carry out against Lebanon (even) if there is a ceasefire in Gaza\".\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Sunday that \"we will continue fighting and doing everything necessary to bring about the desired result\" in the campaign against Hezbollah, \"even if there is a ceasefire\" in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn Lebanon, the cross-border violence since October has killed nearly 500 people, mostly fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nOn the Israeli side, at least 29 people have been killed, the majority of them soldiers, according to the authorities.\n\nNasrallah said Israeli demands to push Hezbollah back from the border \"won't fix\" the situation for Israel.\n\nHis group's launching of \"hundreds of rockets and dozens of drones in a single day\" towards Israeli targets was a message \"that Hezbollah doesn't fear war\", he added.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah stressed that Hezbollah supports all the negotiation choices of the Palestinian Resistance Movement, Hamas, adding that the entire axis of resistance backs those options.\n\nAddressing Hezbollah ceremony held to mourn the martyred commander Hajj Mohammad Neameh Nasser, Sayyed Nasrallah underscored that the Palestinian people, resistance and leadership have shown unrivaled bravery, professionalism and steadfastness.\n\nHis eminence indicated that Hezbollah has never interfered in the choices made by Hamas regarding the indirect negotiations aimed at reaching a ceasefire in Gaza in order to avoid misinterpretations.\n\nSayyed Nasrallah maintained that the Israeli military failure in Gaza has pushed most of the world powers to demand an immediate ceasefire in the Strip, reiterating the direct relation between the southern and the northern fronts.\n\nSayyed Nasrallah added that Hezbollah named its border battle as Al-Aqsa Flood in order to affirm this relation between South Lebanon and Gaza, noting that Hezbollah border battle is aimed at draining the Israeli enemy capabilities and pressing entity into stopping war on Gaza.\n\nHezbollah leader emphasized that the Israeli enemy acknowledges that the northern front is very effective, maintaining that the border battle has started reaching strategic achievements.\n\nMany Western states have been pressing the Israeli government to stop the war on Gaza in order for Hezbollah to stop its border battle, according to Sayyed Nasrallah who added that this exemplifies Hezbollah achievement.\n\nHezbollah border battle has detained over 100 thousand Israeli officers and soldiers in the North for fear of the Resistance infiltration or invasion of Galilee, his eminence said, adding that even the destruction of the spy devices made the enemy rely more on the personnel to gather information.\n\nSayyed Nasrallah indicated that the need for extra troops obliged the Israeli enemy to call up Haredi recruits despite the consequences of the confrontation with this segment, adding that the entity was even obliged to extend the compulsory service for the same reason.\n\nIt is not a tribal battle that imposes equal number of casualties, his eminence underlined, adding that the effects of the battle which push the enemy to halt its war will be the core of interest.\n\nSayyed Nasrallah indicated that 'Israel' is currently experiencing the worst conditions, adding that Netanyahu, Ben Gvir, and Smotrich exemplify narcissism.\n\nSayyed Nasrallah stressed that the Israeli enemy has reached a complete failure, especially in Rafah, which is a 27-square-kilometer city over two months.\n\nIn this regard, Sayyed Nasrallah noted that Netanyahu is leading the entity into abyss, havoc and demise if he does not stop the war on Gaza.\n\nIf 'Israel' Continues War on South Lebanon after Gaza Ceasefire, Hezbollah Will Show Intolerance\n\nHezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah maintained that Gaza war has disciplined the Israeli officials, underlining Lebanon's interest in this Zionist failure.\n\n\"Had 'Israel' achieved a sweeping victory in Gaza, it would have escalated barbarism against the region, especially Lebanon.\"\n\nSayyed Nasrallah indicated that the Israeli officials downplayed their threat rhetoric against Lebanon due to the consequences of Gaza war and Hezbollah border battle.\n\nHis eminence explained that the Israeli officials demanded pushing Hezbollah forces back to, at first, three kilometers when they thought the Resistance possesses only a Kornet missile whose range is 3 kilometers, adding that they started demanding a wider security zone whenever they discover a new Hezbollah missile with a longer range.\n\nWhenever any Israeli tank appears on the borders with Lebanon, Hezbollah strike and destroy them, according to Sayyed Nasrallah.\n\nSayyed Nasrallah stressed that Hezbollah is not afraid of an all-out war at all, adding that the Resistance fighters are firing hundreds of missiles and drones at the Israeli targets after every Zionist assassination crime.\n\nHezbollah will halt its border battle whenever Gaza ceasefire occurs, according to Sayyed Nasrallah who added that, in case of other conditions, the Resistance will act accordingly.\n\nSayyed Nasrallah responded to the Zionist defense minister Yoav Gallant who threatened that the occupation army will continue its aggression on South Lebanon after Gaza ceasefire, maintaining that Hezbollah show intolerance in response.\n\nSayyed Nasrallah congratulates the Islamic Republic of Iran on conducting the presidential elections, thanking the President-elect Masoud Pezeshkian on his answer cable that asserts the Iranian support to the resistance front.\n\nMartyr Hajj Abu Neameh\n\nHezbollah Secretary General extended heartfelt congratulations to the families of the martyrs Abu Neameh and his companion Mohammad Ghasan Khashab as well as the rest Resistance martyrs who were claimed recently for their loved ones attaining a high rank and a noble outcome, and offered deepest condolences for their loss.\n\nSayyed Nasrallah emphasized that the martyrs of the Operation Al-Aqsa Flood exemplify the highest and clearest form of sacrifice for the sake of God. They are martyred in a battle of undeniable truth, where there is no room for doubt.\n\nHezbollah officials always show bravery and confidence in war speeches due to their religious faith and acquaintance with the Resistance military capabilities, Sayyed Nasrallah underscored.\n\nSayyed Nasrallah stressed that Martyr Hajj Abu Neameh\n\n-was captured by the IOF in 1982.\n\n-performed the compulsory military service in the Lebanese Army in 1983.\n\n-joined the Islamic Resistance in 1984.\n\n-was injured in 1988 during an attack within the Israeli occupied territories.\n\n-faced the Israeli aggression on Lebanon in 1993 and 1996.\n\n-led the special forces of the Resistance in the border area (2004-2008).\n\n-joined the military experts and trainers sent by Hezbollah to Iraq in order to face ISIL invasion.\n\n-was appointed as commander of Hezbollah's Aziz battalion in 2016 and remained in office till his martyrdom.\n\n-participated in Hezbollah border battle in support of Gaza till embracing martyrdom.\n\nSayyed Nasrallah added that the martyr was amiable, obedient, brave, modest, disciplined , successful, tactful and ready for martyrdom.\n\n\"When I met him, he was speaking with a high morale about the readiness of the Resistance fighters to participate in the battle.\"\n\nThe martyrs families are voicing readiness to sacrifice more of their children for the

Lebanon, July 10, 2024 (BSS/AFP) - Hezbollah chief Hassan\n\nNasrallah said Wednesday his group would accept Palestinian ally Hamas's\n\ndecision on Gaza truce negotiations, repeating that his movement would stop\n\ncross-border attacks on Israel if a ceasefire were reached.\n\nHezbollah has traded almost daily fire with Israeli forces in support of\n\nHamas since the Palestinian militant group's October 7 attack on Israel\n\ntriggered war in the Gaza Strip, stoking fears of a full-blown conflict.\n\n\"Hamas is negotiating... on behalf of the whole axis of resistance,\"\n\nNasrallah said, referring to regional pro-Iran groups opposed to Israel and the\n\nUnited States.\n\n\"Whatever Hamas accepts, everyone accepts and is satisfied with,\" he said,\n\nadding: \"We do not ask (Hamas) to coordinate with us because the battle in the\n\nfirst instance is theirs.\"\n\nNasrallah's remarks came days after he met with a Hamas delegation headed\n\nby foreign relations chief Khalil al-Hayya, and as talks were to resume in\n\nQatar towards a truce and hostage release deal in the Gaza war, now grinding\n\ninto its 10th month.\n\nHamas has signalled that it would drop its insistence on a \"complete\"\n\nceasefire -- which Israel has repeatedly rejected -- as a condition for\n\nstarting truce talks.\n\nNasrallah repeated his position that \"if a ceasefire is reached, and we all\n\nhope for that... our front will cease fire without any discussion\".\n\n\"That is a commitment, because it is a support front and we have been clear\n\n(about this) from the start,\" he said, during a televised address commemorating\n\na senior Hezbollah commander killed in an Israeli strike last week.\n\nHowever, Nasrallah warned that \"we will never allow any attack that the\n\nIsraeli enemy might carry out against Lebanon (even) if there is a ceasefire in\n\nGaza\".\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Sunday that \"we will continue\n\nfighting and doing everything necessary to bring about the desired result\" in\n\nthe campaign against Hezbollah, \"even if there is a ceasefire\" in the Gaza\n\nStrip.\n\nIn Lebanon, the cross-border violence since October has killed nearly 500\n\npeople, mostly fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP\n\ntally.\n\nOn the Israeli side, at least 29 people have been killed, the majority of\n\nthem soldiers, according to the authorities.\n\nNasrallah said Israeli demands to push Hezbollah back from the border\n\n\"won't fix\" the situation for Israel.\n\nHis group's launching of \"hundreds of rockets and dozens of drones in a\n\nsingle day\" towards Israeli targets was a message \"that Hezbollah doesn't fear\n\nwar\", he added.", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType":

In addition Hezbollah rocket fire killed two people on July 9.\n\nHassan Nasrallah pledged support for the \"oppressed Palestinians in the Gaza Strip until the goals of people and their fighters are accomplished,\" Iran's IRNA state news reported on July 9. The speech was also published at the Al-Ahed website in Lebanon. Nasrallah was speaking to commemorate the Islamic month of Muharram.\n\nHe \"emphasized that the Lebanese resistance, which started its activities in support of Palestine on October 8 following the Al-Aqsa Storm operation and the launch of Israeli genocidal war will go ahead until goals are achieved on all fronts,\" IRNA noted. \"We are looking forward to it and there will be no turning back\", Nasrallah said.\n\nHezbollah is part of the larger Iranian axis of groups that Tehran mobilized to attack Israel after the Hamas attack on October 7. It has launched around 6,000 rockets, missiles and drones at Israel in nine months of war. Hezbollah has said it is backing Hamas and it will continue the attacks so long as the war in Gaza continues.

Nasrallah is channeling this Shi'ite history into his speech to explain Hezbollah's willingness to take more losses fighting Israel. It has already lost around 400 fighters, including half its brigade and division commanders. Key commanders of the Aziz and Nasr sectors south of the Litani river have been eliminated.

hear from anyone allied to us that we are standing on the right side of history,\" Nasrallah said, emphasizing Hezbollah's full preparedness for a military confrontation with the occupying Tel Aviv

were about to start in Qatar on the Gaza war, which is currently in its tenth month.\n\nHamas has signalled that it may remove its demand for a \"complete\" ceasefire, which Israel has consistently rejected, as a prerequisite for starting truce talks.\n\n\"If a ceasefire is reached, and we all hope for that... our front will cease-fire without any discussion,\" Hezbollah supremo said.\n\nAlso

What Hamas accepts, we all accept,\" Nasrallah said, speaking in a televised address to mourn the recent killing of a senior Hezbollah commander.\n\nHezbollah began firing at Israeli targets on the border in support of Palestinians after its ally Hamas launched the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that precipitated the war in Gaza.\n\nIt has repeatedly labeled its attacks as a \"support front\" aimed at drawing Israeli military resources away from Gaza and supporting Palestinians.\n\nTens of thousands of Israelis and Lebanese have been forced to evacuate from the area around the border between the two countries and international observers have warned in recent weeks of the growing risk of a wider conflict.\n\nThe U.S. and France have spearheaded diplomatic efforts to try to secure a deal that would prevent the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah expanding.\n\nNasrallah said that, for Hezbollah, a Gaza ceasefire would be enough to do that.\n\n\"If there is a ceasefire in Gaza then our front will also cease fire without discussion, irrespective of any other agreement or mechanisms or negotiations.\"\n\n(Reporting by Laila Bassam and Timour Azhari; Editing by Toby Chopra)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_Resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Axis of Resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716801", "eventUri": "eng-9716801", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 43, "textEnd": 50}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1093, "textEnd": 1099}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The terrorist leader claimed Israel had been sufficiently distracted from its war with Hamas in Gaza because of the rocket fire across the Lebanon-Israel border.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

If there was a breakthrough in the Doha talks, which \"results in a ceasefire in Gaza,\" Hezbollah will also \"cease its attacks on Israel without any discussion or negotiation.\"\n\nIf the negotiations did not result in a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas, Nasrallah warned Hezbollah was ready for and did not fear a war, and pointed to the ever-larger salvos of rockets and drones the group has fired at Israel as evidence.\n\nMeanwhile, senior Hamas official Hossam Badran claimed Israel is \"intensifying\" its military operations in the Gaza Strip in an attempt to pressure the terror group into a deal. He argued it would fail, and would have the opposite effect of the one intended. Ironically, the threat came on a day when the IDF said it had wrapped up its operations in the eastern Shejaiya neighborhood of Gaza City. Although Israel's military did also warn it would re-enter the area if Hamas - as could be expected - filled the vacuum the withdrawing soldiers would leave. The IDF claimed to have eliminated some 150 terrorists in its operational sweep.\n\nLong-stalled diplomatic efforts have clicked into a higher gear over the last week or so - and certainly the families of the hostages assess a deal for the return of their loved ones could be on the table. Badran's statement highlights the mixed messaging emanating from Hamas.\n\nWhile he argued only a complete ceasefire and a total withdrawal of Israeli troops would be acceptable, especially due to the \"continuation of massacres,\" on Sunday, another Hamas official on condition of anonymity told Agence France-Presse the group was ready to discuss a hostage deal even without a \"complete\" ceasefire.\n\nAny ceasefire, or course, would not be lasting, since according to Hamas' own charter: \"The Day of Judgment will not come about until Moslems fight Jews and kill them. Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.\"\n\nIDF activity in Lebanon, Syria\n\nTalk of a halt to fighting between Israel and the enemies surrounding it was definitely not on the agenda Wednesday. In southern Lebanon around 9:30 p.m. local time, several Hezbollah operatives were spotted entering a building in Tayr Harfa. A drone belonging to the 228th \"Alon\" Brigade identified the terrorists, and a short time later a fighter jet struck the target.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, IDF tanks and artillery shelled Syrian army military infrastructure after they were spotted in a demilitarized zone, which formed part of the 1974 ceasefire agreement concluding the Yom Kippur War.\n\nContent created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

not take permanent charge until he got the coaching badges required by the European governing body UEFA.\n\nFabregas previously managed Como's youth team after retiring as a player last summer and had long been tipped to take over the first team of a club finely attuned to international marketing.\n\nBankrolled by tobacco giants Djarum, Como has stormed through the divisions since being acquired in 2019 following multiple bankruptcies.\n\nComo has created a glitzy image thanks to their glamorous location on Lake Como in northern Italy and has been busy this summer, bringing in a host of new players.\n\nThe latest was Moreno, who on Friday Como said has arrived on a one-year deal \"with automatic renewal for another season if certain conditions are met\".\n\nLeft-back Moreno, who played four times for his country, joined Como after being released by Villarreal at the end of last season.\n\nThe 32-year-old is a two-time Europa League winner with Sevilla and Villarreal and played for five seasons for Liverpool where he had a small role in the Reds winning the 2019 Champions League.\n\nComo, who are at Juventus in their opening game of the coming Serie A season, are also in the hunt for former France defender Raphael Varane.\n\nBut they were embroiled in controversy on Tuesday when one of their players referred to South Korean forward Hwang Hee-chan as Hollywood action star 'Jackie Chan' during a stormy friendly defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nComo attracted widespread criticism when in a statement they insisted the unnamed player \"did not say anything in a derogatory manner\" and \"the reaction of certain Wolves players has seen the incident blown out of proportion\".\n\nThe club also announced on Thursday the signing of Pepe Reina.\n\n\"Como 1907 is pleased to announce the signing of Pepe Reina until June 2025,\" said the club in a statement.\n\nThe 41-year-old, who has played for some of Europe's biggest clubs including Barcelona, Liverpool and Bayern Munich, will be a backup 'keeper for Pau Lopez who is set to arrive from Marseille.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [],

This transition follows his departure from Villarreal, where he rounded off his tenure with 43 first-team appearances over two seasons. His arrival at Como isn't just a new signing; it's a statement of intent from the Serie A club, eager to make its mark upon its return to Italy's top flight after 21 years.\n\nReina's move is wrapped in his own words, \"I arrive in a beautiful project, a family that continues to grow and tries to raise the bar every year. I return to a league that I know well and that I know is very competitive, for my part I want to give my contribution to the development of this club.\"\n\nThe Spaniard's career is nothing short of illustrious, with a notable eight-season spell at Liverpool, where he became a household name. During his time at Anfield, Reina notched up 394 first-team appearances and lifted four major trophies, including the FA Cup in 2006. His consistent performance also earned him the Premier League's Golden Glove award for three consecutive seasons, a testament to his prowess between the posts.\n\nFollowing his stint in England, Reina's journey saw him don various club jerseys across Europe, including those of Napoli, Bayern Munich, Milan, Aston Villa, and Lazio, before a second spell at Villarreal in 2022. His seasoned experience is a valuable asset for Como, as articulated by their head coach, Cesc Fabregas, \"We are thrilled to welcome Pepe to the club. He is a goalkeeper with great international experience and a very competitive mentality. For these reasons, I am sure that his contribution will help the team to grow and improve.\"\n\nAt 41, and turning 42 next month, Reina brings not just skill but immense experience to Como, with 977 appearances under his belt across his senior career at both club and international levels. Last season at Villarreal saw him feature predominantly in the Europa League, demonstrating his capability to perform on big stages, an attribute Como will be counting on.\n\nComo's resurgence to Serie A is a narrative of patience and perseverance, culminating in their return to the pinnacle of Italian football after more than two decades. Reina's signing is pivotal, symbolizing not only a strategic reinforcement but also a significant boost to the team's morale and competitive edge.\n\nAs Como prepares to establish itself in Serie A, the integration of a player of Reina's calibre could be crucial. His understanding of the game, honed over years at the top levels of European football, along with his leadership qualities, will be instrumental in navigating the challenges of a highly competitive league.\n\nPepe Reina's transition to Como marks a thrilling chapter for both the player and the club. As they gear up for the coming season, the football community will be keen to see how this seasoned veteran influences the dynamics of a team eager to make its presence felt in Italy's top-tier football. It's a narrative of rejuvenation and ambition, with Como and Reina both looking to add meaningful chapters to their illustrious stories.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_Reina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pepe Reina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Como", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Como"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Como"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villarreal_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Villarreal CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Golden_Glove", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League Golden Glove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nCesc Fabregas, the Como manager, has completed the signing of former Aston Villa goalkeeper and Liverpool great Pepe Reina ahead of the new Serie A season. Arsenal, Chelsea and Barcelona favourite Fabregas took charge of Como this summer after helping them as a caretaker boss and assistant coach to win promotion last term.\n\nFabregas, who is a shareholder alongside former teammate Thierry Henry, was installed as the permanent boss this summer and Como are proving to be ambitious with their recruitment. Having signed former Wolves attacker Patrick Cutrone - he fired them to promotion as top scorer - and Cypriot and former Nottingham Forest star Nicholas Ioannou, they've also added Torino great Andrea Belotti from Roma.\n\nNow, Reina has signed up for the season to extend his distinguished career by at least another year. He insisted in June that he had an intention to continue playing after leaving Villarreal: \"It's not easy to say goodbye to what has been, is and will always be my home. Now I need to find the place that will help me write the last chapter, feeling very prepared and motivated to do so.\"\n\nREAD: Moussa Diaby exit could spark \u00a355m transfer domino involving Nico Williams\n\nREAD: Arne Slot receives Ollie Watkins transfer response amid signing claim\n\nHe has done so, with Como, and in Fabregas he has reunited with a former Spanish international colleague. He, like Fabregas, won Euro 2008 and Euro 2012 with Spain, as well as the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Reina's career is a decorated one; he played 394 games for Liverpool but also played for Lazio, Barcelona, Napoli, Bayern Munich and AC Milan.\n\nReina joined Villa on loan in January 2020 after an injury suffered by Tom Heaton, and helped Dean Smith and Co keep Villa in the Premier League in dramatic circumstances across his 12 appearances between the sticks.\n\nWhat are your memories of Reina at Villa?

However, the 41-year-old found his game-time limited during the last campaign as he made only a couple of appearances in La Liga and will continue his career in Italy next term.\n\nHeading to Lombardy to team up with Como head coach Fabregas, the pair previously crossed paths during their careers with the Spanish national team. After a 21 year absence from the Italian top flight, the club earned promotion last year after finishing as runners-up in the second tier.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool transfer news LIVE: Rayan Ait-Nouri inquiry, Nico Williams 'bid', Marc Guehi clause\n\nREAD MORE: Luis Diaz breaks silence with 'painful' message ahead of Liverpool return\n\nReina will bring a wealth of experience to the upwardly-mobile outfit, having represented European giants including Bayern Munich and Barcelona during his career. Alongside new boss Fabregas, he also formed part of the Spanish squads that reigned victorious at the 2010 World Cup, alongside the European Championships in 2008 and 2012.\n\nHe is perhaps best remembered for his eight-year stint on Merseyside, though, where he became a firm fan favorite during the years between 2005 and 2013. Earning the Premier League Golden Glove on three occasions during his time at Anfield, he made 394 appearances for the club.\n\nIn addition to this, the former Reds ace has played for three clubs in Serie A before today, having enjoyed spells with Napoli, AC Milan and Lazio previously. Speaking to the official Como website, Fabregas spoke in glowing terms about the newest addition to his squad as he looked forward to the upcoming season.\n\nHe said: \"We are thrilled to welcome Pepe to the club.

He\u2019s not the perfect president, nor is he the perfect candidate. However, if he were to \u201cbow out\u201d of the race at this or any time between now and Election Day, it would give Donald Trump an ironclad guarantee of four years more in the White House (\u201cI was in D.C. on Jan. 6th; Biden must drop out to save our republic,\u201d May 22). It is far too late for the Democratic Party to introduce even a marginally viable candidate to take his place. Let\u2019s not go down the path of discarding an imperfect candidate to search for a perfect one. Such a candidate doesn\u2019t exist, and arguably never has. \u2014 Thaddeus Paulhamus, Baltimore Add your voice: Respond to this piece or other Sun content by submitting your own letter.", "summary": "Joe Biden may not be the perfect candidate but he represents the country's best chance to defeat Donald Trump.", "url": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/2024/05/26/too-late-to-replace-biden/", "image": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Biden_38949_f1a047.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:53:28", "author": "Reader Commentary", "authors": ["Reader Commentary"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.311}

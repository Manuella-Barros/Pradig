{"id": 237118836, "title": "Sprints and Kneecap send a bombastic message that Ireland (finally) has more to offer than U2", "text": "As potent as the Cranberries\u2019 glitter-grunge anthem \u201cZombie\u201d still sounds today, it\u2019s always been hard to get excited about Irish music once you get beyond the fabulously booze-addled Pogues and righteously indignant brilliance of Stiff Little Fingers. Here\u2019s a telling reality: Google \u201cmost revolutionary Irish bands\u201d and you\u2019ll get a list that starts with Clannad, the Chieftains, the Dubliners, the Corrs, and the Irish Rovers (who are actually from Toronto). Thin Lizzy counts, but only if you once unironically wore flares. (Dear people of Ireland we undersand\u2014the rest of the world thinks Canadian music starts with Bryan Adams and ends with Nickelback. Sorry, the Tragically doesn't count unless you're Canadian, eh.) Think about Ireland\u2019s most fabled musical export. And then remember this golden rule of thumb: people who are deep into music have zero time for U2, and those who aren\u2019t never pass up the chance to belt out \u201cWhere the Streets Have No Name\u201d when it's karaoke time at Funky Winker Beans. But against type, two Irish upstarts are on constant rotation these days whenever it\u2019s time to hop on the bike and pedal down to Superflux, Cartems Donuts, or Prophecy downtown (where Jeff Savage is once again proving himself one of the most GOATED bartenders in the city). First up, Sprints. Maybe because pop culture tends to repeat itself every 20 years or so\u2014remember when everyone wanted to live in Williamsburg?\u2014guitar music continues to have a bit of a moment in 2024. Dublin\u2019s Sprints hit the ground thumping on the quartet\u2019s new Letter To Self, with the opening track \u201cTicking\u201d playing out like a dialled-down homage to the opening of Refused\u2019s \u201cNew Noise\u201d. In the song, Singer Karla Chubb at first seems ground down and numbed by life, catatonically announcing \u201cMaybe I should do it better/Maybe I should try it harder.\u201d Slowly, her self-described garage-punk bandmates join the anti-party, asking, mantra-like \u201cAm I alive/Am I alive/Am I live\u201d? And then all fucking hell breaks loose, to the point where the guitar violence is pretty much guaranteed to get the neighbours banging on the walls, ceiling, and downstairs floor. Fuck \u2019em. After the smart-bomb that is \u201cTicking\u201d, Letter To Self, impossibly, only gets better. Crank it\u2014and then make a mental note to buy a Dunlop M104 Distortion Plus pedal, candy-apple-red 1964 Valco Airline guitar, and everything ever recorded on Matador. On a totally different vibe, you might have first heard Kneecap on these shores at the end of an early Bodkin episode. (Loved the show at at first, mostly because Siobh\u00e1n Culle is a pissed-off-at-life fucking badass, but eventually keeping track of the various sublots and townsfolk became too much). Hailing from North Belfast, the genre-bending hip-hop trio is every bit as thrilling and exotically new as Die Antwoord before the, umm, troubles. Kneecap\u2019s sophomore album, Fine Art, hit streaming services this past week, and it finds MCs Mo Chara and M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap rapping about everything from Irish independence to the beauty of uncut coke\u2014lyrics delivered in a mix of hood-rat English and gloriously indecipherable (mura labhra\u00edonn t\u00fa \u00e9) Irish. Because of the latter, good luck singing along along to \u201cIom cib\u00e9 a bheadh at\u00e1 ann/T\u00e1 an droch ar a couple of grand\u2019 in \u201cI bhFiacha Linne\u201d on your next road trip through County Cork. Sonically the two MCs, along with DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed, throw pretty much everything into the trash compactor: golden-era NYC hip-hop, U.K. drill and doublegrimed-garage, Jamaican dancehall, Berlin techno Eurotrash house. The end result is, implausibly given all the reference points, something not only fiercely original, but defiantly and gloriously Irish. As revolutionary-seeming as the Pogues and Stiff Little Fingers were. Only, Kneecap is about 2,000 times more difficult to sing at karaoke. Don\u2019t let that stop you from trying, because Christ knows, from Sprints to Kneecap, it\u2019s obvious that a new breed of Irish bands is. That doesn\u2019t make up for U2. But at least there\u2019s, finally, from the perspective of the average North American, life beyond \u201cZombie\u201d.", "summary": "Someone at long last wrote songs as great as \"Zombie\".", "url": "https://www.straight.com/music/sprints-and-kneecap-send-a-bombastic-message-that-ireland-finally-has-more-to-offer-than-u2", "image": "https://www.straight.com/files/v3/styles/gs_feature/public/images/24/06/knee.jpg?itok=VwLfEAvj", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:11:22", "author": "Mike Usinger", "authors": ["Mike Usinger"], "language": "en", "source_country": "co", "sentiment": 0.116}

He will be out for at least a month.\n\nSupport your AFL team in style - check out The Oodie!

After their first loss of the season, Geelong host Port Adelaide this Friday night.\n\nTaylor Bruhn was subbed off mid-game against Melbourne with a shoulder injury but coach Chris Scott is hopeful it is not serious.\n\nWest Coast say they will prioritise Tyler Brockman's health and wellbeing after the forward was involved in a car crash that is being investigated by police.\n\nBrockman was involved in a traffic accident in Geraldton, 420km north of Perth, early on Saturday morning.\n\nThe 21-year-old attended a family funeral on Friday afternoon.\n\nWest Coast say no other vehicle was involved, and no one was injured.\n\n\"This matter is being investigated by the WA Police and Tyler is fully co-operating,\" West Coast said in a statement.\n\n\"Tyler's personal circumstances are complex, and the club will prioritise his health and wellbeing ahead of any return to playing football.\n\n\"The club has informed the AFL regarding this incident, and we await the outcome of the police investigation before making any further comment.\"\n\nBrockman played 26 games for Hawthorn before being traded to West Coast at the end of last year.\n\nThe small forward was goalless across his first six games for the Eagles before being omitted for last week's six-point loss to Essendon.\n\nWest Coast are nursing a number of injury concerns leading into Sunday's clash with Collingwood at Marvel Stadium.\n\nIn-form forward Jake Waterman will miss the match with concussion, while gun midfielder Elliot Yeo is also expected to spend a stint on the sidelines after injuring his groin.\n\nCoach Adam Simpson said on Monday night that they are awaiting scans on Yeo, but it is not a recurrence of the star's osteitis pubis.\n\n\"It's more of a pulled muscle, so we're hoping it's just a one-to-two-week injury,\" Simpson told Fox Footy.\n\nSecond-year forward Noah Long is also awaiting the results of scans after his knee twisted awkwardly in a tackle on the weekend.\n\nThere's a chance Long damaged his anterior cruciate ligament.\n\n\"We hope for the best, but fear the worst,\" Simpson said.", "source": {"uri": "theroar.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Roar"},

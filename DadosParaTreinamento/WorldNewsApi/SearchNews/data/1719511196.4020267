Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial.- Other cases -Aside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Michael Cohen, Trump's former \"fixer\" turned bitter foe who arranged the $130,000 hush money payment.Walking jurors through the reasoning behind the payments, Cohen said they were made \"to ensure that the story would not come out, would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"Trump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.The defense called only two witnesses of their own before resting.In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.He also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.None of those trials are expected to take place before the November election.", "summary": "<img border=\"0\" hspace=\"10\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;\" src=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/110442788.cms\" />The historic trial of Donald Trump is reaching its conclusion on Tuesday.

The president, who has insisted he can beat Trump, was huddling with family and relying on a few longtime aides as he resisted efforts to shove him aside.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump on Saturday will hold his first public campaign rally since he was injured in an assassination attempt, with an event in the battleground state of Michigan alongside his new running mate, U.S. Sen. JD Vance.\n\nFollow the AP's Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nMajority of Democrats think Kamala Harris would make a good president, AP-NORC poll shows\n\nAs President Joe Biden faces a growing drumbeat of pressure to drop his reelection bid, a majority of Democrats think his vice president would make a good president herself.\n\nA new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Kamala Harris would do a good job in the top slot. About 2 in 10 Democrats don't believe she would, and another 2 in 10 say they don't know enough to say.\n\nSince Biden's debate debacle on June 27, many Democrats have privately and even openly looked to Harris to step in and succeed Biden as the party's presidential nominee, believing she has a better chance against GOP nominee Donald Trump. For her part, Harris has remained completely loyal to Biden, being one of his toughest defenders in the aftermath of the disastrous debate performance.\n\nRead more about the poll here.\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown one of several members of Congress to call for Biden to end his campaign\n\nThird-term U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, was one of a dozen members of Congress who on Friday said Biden should end his campaign.\n\nThe plea came as Brown faces Republican Bernie Moreno, a Cleveland businessman, in what's viewed as one of the most competitive Senate races of the year.\n\nBrown is the only Democrat holding a statewide position in Ohio. His former bellwether state has twice supported Donald Trump by large margins and Trump has the state's junior senator, JD Vance, as his running mate.\n\nWhile Brown has enjoyed a long, close relationship with Biden -- he was even on the shortlist to be Biden's vice presidential pick -- he has worked to distance himself this cycle amid Biden's unpopularity. Brown has aired ads touting his support for border- and fentanyl-related legislation, highlighting one bill that Brown sponsored \"and Trump signed.\"\n\nViewership for Trump's RNC acceptance speech peaked at 28.4 million\n\nFor better or worse, former President Trump had a large audience watching him deliver his nomination acceptance speech at the RNC on Thursday.\n\nAn estimated 25.4 million people watched the final night of the convention on one of 14 networks that were covering it, the Nielsen company said on Friday. Viewership peaked at 28.4 million between 10:45 and 11 p.m. Eastern, at the beginning of Trump's speech, Nielsen said.\n\nThat would be good news for the ex-president. The early part of his speech, where he spoke dramatically about last Saturday's attempt on his life, was generally regarded as its most effective. As it dragged on past the 90-minute part and past midnight on the East Coast, Trump largely went off-script for remarks that resembled his typical stump speech.\n\nFox News Channel had 9.4 million viewers during Trump's speech, comfortably ahead of any other network. An estimated 72 percent of the viewers were aged 55 and up, Nielsen said.\n\nIt was the most-watched night of the convention, which is typical for the evening when the presidential nominee speaks.\n\nBlack lawmakers are standing by Biden at a crucial moment. But some express concerns\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus prides itself on its authority among Democrats and its influence with President Joe Biden in particular. So far, only one of its roughly 60 members have joined calls for Biden to drop his reelection bid due to concerns over his age and ability to win.\n\nBut the caucus' broad backing of the president varies widely, ranging from enthusiastic support to outright skepticism. And a small but growing number within the group are publicly expressing doubts about Biden's candidacy.\n\nBlack voters are widely credited with helping Biden clinch the Democratic nomination four years ago and then defeat Republican Donald Trump. Whether Black lawmakers stick with the president now, and how fervently they do so, could be critical in the coming days as pressure builds from the highest levels of the Democratic Party for Biden to end his campaign.\n\n\u25b6 Read about Black lawmakers' relationship with the president\n\nMore from this section\n\n[Updated!] Pokemon GO Failed to Detect Location 12 Fixed by using Tenorshare iAnyGo\n\nWilliam Cole Vineyards Celebrates the 25th Anniversary of Cuv\u00e9e Claire\n\nLuvme Hair Celebrates Success with Atlanta Pop-Up Shop", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

The president, who has insisted he can beat Trump, was huddling with family and relying on a few longtime aides as he resisted efforts to shove him aside.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump on Saturday will hold his first public campaign rally since he was injured in an assassination attempt, with an event in the battleground state of Michigan alongside his new running mate, U.S. Sen. JD Vance.\n\nFollow the AP's Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown one of several members of Congress to call for Biden to end his campaign\n\nThird-term U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, was one of a dozen members of Congress who on Friday said Biden should end his campaign.\n\nThe plea came as Brown faces Republican Bernie Moreno, a Cleveland businessman, in what's viewed as one of the most competitive Senate races of the year.\n\nBrown is the only Democrat holding a statewide position in Ohio. His former bellwether state has twice supported Donald Trump by large margins and Trump has the state's junior senator, JD Vance, as his running mate.\n\nWhile Brown has enjoyed a long, close relationship with Biden -- he was even on the shortlist to be Biden's vice presidential pick -- he has worked to distance himself this cycle amid Biden's unpopularity. Brown has aired ads touting his support for border- and fentanyl-related legislation, highlighting one bill that Brown sponsored \"and Trump signed.\"\n\nViewership for Trump's RNC acceptance speech peaked at 28.4 million\n\nFor better or worse, former President Trump had a large audience watching him deliver his nomination acceptance speech at the RNC on Thursday.\n\nAn estimated 25.4 million people watched the final night of the convention on one of 14 networks that were covering it, the Nielsen company said on Friday. Viewership peaked at 28.4 million between 10:45 and 11 p.m. Eastern, at the beginning of Trump's speech, Nielsen said.\n\nThat would be good news for the ex-president. The early part of his speech, where he spoke dramatically about last Saturday's attempt on his life, was generally regarded as its most effective. As it dragged on past the 90-minute part and past midnight on the East Coast, Trump largely went off-script for remarks that resembled his typical stump speech.\n\nFox News Channel had 9.4 million viewers during Trump's speech, comfortably ahead of any other network. An estimated 72 percent of the viewers were aged 55 and up, Nielsen said.\n\nIt was the most-watched night of the convention, which is typical for the evening when the presidential nominee speaks.\n\nBlack lawmakers are standing by Biden at a crucial moment.

Sherrod Brown one of several members of Congress to call for Biden to end his campaign\n\nThird-term U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, was one of a dozen members of Congress who on Friday said Biden should end his campaign.\n\nThe plea came as Brown faces Republican Bernie Moreno, a Cleveland businessman, in what's viewed as one of the most competitive Senate races of the year.\n\nBrown is the only Democrat holding a statewide position in Ohio. His former bellwether state has twice supported Donald Trump by large margins and Trump has the state's junior senator, JD Vance, as his running mate.\n\nWhile Brown has enjoyed a long, close relationship with Biden -- he was even on the shortlist to be Biden's vice presidential pick -- he has worked to distance himself this cycle amid Biden's unpopularity. Brown has aired ads touting his support for border- and fentanyl-related legislation, highlighting one bill that Brown sponsored \"and Trump signed.\"\n\nViewership for Trump's RNC acceptance speech peaked at 28.4 million\n\nFor better or worse, former President Trump had a large audience watching him deliver his nomination acceptance speech at the RNC on Thursday.\n\nAn estimated 25.4 million people watched the final night of the convention on one of 14 networks that were covering it, the Nielsen company said on Friday.

The early part of his speech, where he spoke dramatically about last Saturday's attempt on his life, was generally regarded as its most effective. As it dragged on past the 90-minute part and past midnight on the East Coast, Trump largely went off-script for remarks that resembled his typical stump speech.\n\nFox News Channel had 9.4 million viewers during Trump's speech, comfortably ahead of any other network. An estimated 72 percent of the viewers were aged 55 and up, Nielsen said.\n\nIt was the most-watched night of the convention, which is typical for the evening when the presidential nominee speaks.\n\nBlack lawmakers are standing by Biden at a crucial moment.

About 2 in 10 Democrats don't believe she would, and another 2 in 10 say they don't know enough to say.\n\nSince Biden's debate debacle on June 27, many Democrats have privately and even openly looked to Harris to step in and succeed Biden as the party's presidential nominee, believing she has a better chance against GOP nominee Donald Trump. For her part, Harris has remained completely loyal to Biden, being one of his toughest defenders in the aftermath of the disastrous debate performance.\n\nRead more about the poll here.\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown one of several members of Congress to call for Biden to end his campaign\n\nThird-term U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, was one of a dozen members of Congress who on Friday said Biden should end his campaign.\n\nThe plea came as Brown faces Republican Bernie Moreno, a Cleveland businessman, in what's viewed as one of the most competitive Senate races of the year.\n\nBrown is the only Democrat holding a statewide position in Ohio. His former bellwether state has twice supported Donald Trump by large margins and Trump has the state's junior senator, JD Vance, as his running mate.\n\nWhile Brown has enjoyed a long, close relationship with Biden -- he was even on the shortlist to be Biden's vice presidential pick -- he has worked to distance himself this cycle amid Biden's unpopularity. Brown has aired ads touting his support for border- and fentanyl-related legislation, highlighting one bill that Brown sponsored \"and Trump signed.\"\n\nViewership for Trump's RNC acceptance speech peaked at 28.4 million\n\nFor better or worse, former President Trump had a large audience watching him deliver his nomination acceptance speech at the RNC on Thursday.\n\nAn estimated 25.4 million people watched the final night of the convention on one of 14 networks that were covering it, the Nielsen company said on Friday.

JD Vance.\n\nFollow the AP's Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nTrump returns to the campaign trail in Michigan\n\nRepublican Donald Trump on Saturday will hold his first public campaign rally since he was injured in an assassination attempt, with an event in the battleground state of Michigan alongside his new running mate.\n\nThe joint rally with Ohio Sen. JD Vance is the first for the pair since they became the GOP's nominees at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Trump kicked off the gathering of Republicans by naming Vance his vice presidential pick and concluded it with a speech urging unity following a July 13 shooting in Pennsylvania that left Trump with a bloodied ear and killed one man in the crowd.\n\n\"I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America,\" Trump said Thursday night in what was the longest convention speech in modern history at just under 93 minutes.\n\nRead more about the crucial role Michigan could play in the election.\n\nMajority of Democrats think Kamala Harris would make a good president, AP-NORC poll shows\n\nAs President Joe Biden faces a growing drumbeat of pressure to drop his reelection bid, a majority of Democrats think his vice president would make a good president herself.\n\nA new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Kamala Harris would do a good job in the top slot. About 2 in 10 Democrats don't believe she would, and another 2 in 10 say they don't know enough to say.\n\nSince Biden's debate debacle on June 27, many Democrats have privately and even openly looked to Harris to step in and succeed Biden as the party's presidential nominee, believing she has a better chance against GOP nominee Donald Trump. For her part, Harris has remained completely loyal to Biden, being one of his toughest defenders in the aftermath of the disastrous debate performance.\n\nRead more about the poll here.\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown one of several members of Congress to call for Biden to end his campaign\n\nThird-term U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, was one of a dozen members of Congress who on Friday said Biden should end his campaign.\n\nThe plea came as Brown faces Republican Bernie Moreno, a Cleveland businessman, in what's viewed as one of the most competitive Senate races of the year.\n\nBrown is the only Democrat holding a statewide position in Ohio. His former bellwether state has twice supported Donald Trump by large margins and Trump has the state's junior senator, JD Vance, as his running mate.\n\nWhile Brown has enjoyed a long, close relationship with Biden -- he was even on the shortlist to be Biden's vice presidential pick -- he has worked to distance himself this cycle amid Biden's unpopularity. Brown has aired ads touting his support for border- and fentanyl-related legislation, highlighting one bill that Brown sponsored \"and Trump signed.\"\n\nViewership for Trump's RNC acceptance speech peaked at 28.4 million\n\nFor better or worse, former President Trump had a large audience watching him deliver his nomination acceptance speech at the RNC on Thursday.\n\nAn estimated 25.4 million people watched the final night of the convention on one of 14 networks that were covering it, the Nielsen company said on Friday. Viewership peaked at 28.4 million between 10:45 and 11 p.m. Eastern, at the beginning of Trump's speech, Nielsen said.\n\nThat would be good news for the ex-president. The early part of his speech, where he spoke dramatically about last Saturday's attempt on his life, was generally regarded as its most effective. As it dragged on past the 90-minute part and past midnight on the East Coast, Trump largely went off-script for remarks that resembled his typical stump speech.\n\nFox News Channel had 9.4 million viewers during Trump's speech, comfortably ahead of any other network. An estimated 72 percent of the viewers were aged 55 and up, Nielsen said.\n\nIt was the most-watched night of the convention, which is typical for the evening when the presidential nominee speaks.\n\nBlack lawmakers are standing by Biden at a crucial moment. But some express concerns\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus prides itself on its authority among Democrats and its influence with President Joe Biden in particular. So far, only one of its roughly 60 members have joined calls for Biden to drop his reelection bid due to concerns over his age and ability to win.\n\nBut the caucus' broad backing of the president varies widely, ranging from enthusiastic support to outright skepticism. And a small but growing number within the group are publicly expressing doubts about Biden's candidacy.\n\nBlack voters are widely credited with helping Biden clinch the Democratic nomination four years ago and then defeat Republican Donald Trump. Whether Black lawmakers stick with the president now, and how fervently they do so, could be critical in the coming days as pressure builds from the highest levels of the Democratic Party for Biden to end his campaign.\n\n\u25b6 Read about Black lawmakers' relationship with the president", "source": {"uri": "bradfordera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Bradford Era"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@bradfordera.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

The president, who has insisted he can beat Trump, was huddling with family and relying on a few longtime aides as he resisted efforts to shove him aside.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump on Saturday will hold his first public campaign rally since he was injured in an assassination attempt, with an event in the battleground state of Michigan alongside his new running mate, U.S. Sen. JD Vance.\n\nFollow the AP's Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nThird-term U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, was one of a dozen members of Congress who on Friday said Biden should end his campaign.\n\nThe plea came as Brown faces Republican Bernie Moreno, a Cleveland businessman, in what's viewed as one of the most competitive Senate races of the year.\n\nBrown is the only Democrat holding a statewide position in Ohio. His former bellwether state has twice supported Donald Trump by large margins and Trump has the state's junior senator, JD Vance, as his running mate.\n\nWhile Brown has enjoyed a long, close relationship with Biden -- he was even on the shortlist to be Biden's vice presidential pick -- he has worked to distance himself this cycle amid Biden's unpopularity. Brown has aired ads touting his support for border- and fentanyl-related legislation, highlighting one bill that Brown sponsored \"and Trump signed.\"\n\nFor better or worse, former President Trump had a large audience watching him deliver his nomination acceptance speech at the RNC on Thursday.\n\nAn estimated 25.4 million people watched the final night of the convention on one of 14 networks that were covering it, the Nielsen company said on Friday. Viewership peaked at 28.4 million between 10:45 and 11 p.m. Eastern, at the beginning of Trump's speech, Nielsen said.\n\nThat would be good news for the ex-president. The early part of his speech, where he spoke dramatically about last Saturday's attempt on his life, was generally regarded as its most effective. As it dragged on past the 90-minute part and past midnight on the East Coast, Trump largely went off-script for remarks that resembled his typical stump speech.\n\nFox News Channel had 9.4 million viewers during Trump's speech, comfortably ahead of any other network. An estimated 72 percent of the viewers were aged 55 and up, Nielsen said.\n\nIt was the most-watched night of the convention, which is typical for the evening when the presidential nominee speaks.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus prides itself on its authority among Democrats and its influence with President Joe Biden in particular. So far, only one of its roughly 60 members have joined calls for Biden to drop his reelection bid due to concerns over his age and ability to win.\n\nBut the caucus' broad backing of the president varies widely, ranging from enthusiastic support to outright skepticism. And a small but growing number within the group are publicly expressing doubts about Biden's candidacy.\n\nBlack voters are widely credited with helping Biden clinch the Democratic nomination four years ago and then defeat Republican Donald Trump. Whether Black lawmakers stick with the president now, and how fervently they do so, could be critical in the coming days as pressure builds from the highest levels of the Democratic Party for Biden to end his campaign.\n\n\u25b6 Read about Black lawmakers' relationship with the president", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Democrats at the highest levels are making a critical push for Biden to reconsider his election bid. Former President Barack Obama has privately expressed concerns to Democrats about Biden's candidacy.

JD Vance is the first for the pair since they became the GOP\u00b4s nominees at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Trump kicked off the gathering of Republicans by naming Vance his vice presidential pick and concluded it with a speech urging unity following a July 13 shooting in Pennsylvania that left Trump with a bloodied ear and killed one man in the crowd.\n\n\"I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America,\" Trump said Thursday night in what was the longest convention speech in modern history at just under 93 minutes.\n\nRead more about the crucial role Michigan could play in the election.\n\nAs President Joe Biden faces a growing drumbeat of pressure to drop his reelection bid, a majority of Democrats think his vice president would make a good president herself.\n\nA new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Kamala Harris would do a good job in the top slot. About 2 in 10 Democrats don\u00b4t believe she would, and another 2 in 10 say they don\u00b4t know enough to say.\n\nSince Biden\u00b4s debate debacle on June 27, many Democrats have privately and even openly looked to Harris to step in and succeed Biden as the party\u00b4s presidential nominee, believing she has a better chance against GOP nominee Donald Trump. For her part, Harris has remained completely loyal to Biden, being one of his toughest defenders in the aftermath of the disastrous debate performance.\n\nRead more about the poll here.\n\nThird-term U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, was one of a dozen members of Congress who on Friday said Biden should end his campaign.\n\nThe plea came as Brown faces Republican Bernie Moreno, a Cleveland businessman, in what\u00b4s viewed as one of the most competitive Senate races of the year.\n\nBrown is the only Democrat holding a statewide position in Ohio. His former bellwether state has twice supported Donald Trump by large margins and Trump has the state\u00b4s junior senator, JD Vance, as his running mate.\n\nWhile Brown has enjoyed a long, close relationship with Biden - he was even on the shortlist to be Biden\u00b4s vice presidential pick - he has worked to distance himself this cycle amid Biden\u00b4s unpopularity.

The president, who has insisted he can beat Trump, was huddling with family and relying on a few longtime aides as he resisted efforts to shove him aside.\n\nLate Friday, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is in a tough race for reelection, called for Biden to step aside.\n\nBrown said in a statement that he agrees with \"the many Ohioans\" who have reached out to him. \"I think the president should end his campaign,\" he said.\n\nAnd in a statement later Friday, Rep. Morgan McGarvey, D-Ky., also called on Biden to drop out while saying, \"there is no joy in the recognition he should not be our nominee in November. But the stakes of this election are too high.\"\n\nBiden said Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention showcased a \"dark vision for the future.\" The president, seeking to move the political conversation away from his fate and onto his rival's agenda, said Friday he was planning to return to the campaign trail next week and insisted he has a path to victory over Trump, despite the worries of some of his party's most eminent members.\n\n\"Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box,\" Biden said. \"The stakes are high, and the choice is clear. Together, we will win.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, his campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillion, acknowledged \"slippage\" in support for the president but insisted he's \"absolutely\" remaining in the race and the campaign sees \"multiple paths\" to beating Trump.\n\nAmong the democrats expressing worries to allies about Biden's chances were former President Barack Obama and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who has privately told Biden the party could lose the ability to seize control of the House if he doesn't step aside.\n\nCampaign officials said Biden was even more committed to staying in the race. And senior West Wing aides have had no internal discussions or conversations with the president about dropping out.\n\nOn Friday, Biden picked up a key endorsement from the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. CHC BOLD PAC said the Biden administration has shown \"unwavering commitment\" to Latinos and \"the stakes couldn't be higher\" in this election.\n\nBut there is also time to reconsider. Biden has been told the campaign is having trouble raising money, and key Democrats see an opportunity as he is away from the campaign for a few days to encourage his exit. Among his Cabinet, some are resigned to the likelihood of him losing in November.\n\nAP", "source": {"uri": "en.ammonnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0648\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0647"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_McGarvey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morgan McGarvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Hispanic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Hispanic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic and Latino Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://en.ammonnews.net/image.php?token=c652c66a3456cdb3ae06c6a3c7f199dd&c=4396800&size=", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747753", "eventUri": "eng-9747753", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Viewership peaked at 28.4 million between 10:45 and 11 p.m. Eastern, at the beginning of Trump's speech, Nielsen said.\n\nThat would be good news for the ex-president. The early part of his speech, where he spoke dramatically about last Saturday's attempt on his life, was generally regarded as its most effective. As it dragged on past the 90-minute part and past midnight on the East Coast, Trump largely went off-script for remarks that resembled his typical stump speech.\n\nFox News Channel had 9.4 million viewers during Trump's speech, comfortably ahead of any other network. An estimated 72 percent of the viewers were aged 55 and up, Nielsen said.\n\nIt was the most-watched night of the convention, which is typical for the evening when the presidential nominee speaks.\n\nBlack lawmakers are standing by Biden at a crucial moment. But some express concerns\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus prides itself on its authority among Democrats and its influence with President Joe Biden in particular.

JD Vance.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nRepublican Donald Trump on Saturday will hold his first public campaign rally since he was injured in an assassination attempt, with an event in the battleground state of Michigan alongside his new running mate.\n\nThe joint rally with Ohio Sen. JD Vance is the first for the pair since they became the GOP's nominees at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Trump kicked off the gathering of Republicans by naming Vance his vice presidential pick and concluded it with a speech urging unity following a July 13 shooting in Pennsylvania that left Trump with a bloodied ear and killed one man in the crowd.\n\n\"I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America,\" Trump said Thursday night in what was the longest convention speech in modern history at just under 93 minutes.\n\nAs President Joe Biden faces a growing drumbeat of pressure to drop his reelection bid, a majority of Democrats think his vice president would make a good president herself.\n\nA new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about two in 10 Democrats believe Kamala Harris would do a good job in the top slot. About two in 10 Democrats don't believe she would, and another two in 10 say they don't know enough to say.\n\nSince Biden's debate debacle on June 27, many Democrats have privately and even openly looked to Harris to step in and succeed Biden as the party's presidential nominee, believing she has a better chance against GOP nominee Donald Trump. For her part, Harris has remained completely loyal to Biden, being one of his toughest defenders in the aftermath of the disastrous debate performance.\n\nRead more about the poll here.\n\nThird-term U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, was one of a dozen members of Congress who on Friday said Biden should end his campaign.\n\nThe plea came as Brown faces Republican Bernie Moreno, a Cleveland businessman, in what's viewed as one of the most competitive Senate races of the year.\n\nBrown is the only Democrat holding a statewide position in Ohio. His former bellwether state has twice supported Donald Trump by large margins and Trump has the state's junior senator, JD Vance, as his running mate.\n\nWhile Brown has enjoyed a long, close relationship with Biden -- he was even on the shortlist to be Biden's vice presidential pick -- he has worked to distance himself this cycle amid Biden's unpopularity. Brown has aired ads touting his support for border- and fentanyl-related legislation, highlighting one bill that Brown sponsored \"and Trump signed.\"\n\nFor better or worse, former President Trump had a large audience watching him deliver his nomination acceptance speech at the RNC on Thursday.\n\nAn estimated 25.4 million people watched the final night of the convention on one of 14 networks that were covering it, the Nielsen company said on Friday. Viewership peaked at 28.4 million between 10:45 and 11 p.m. Eastern, at the beginning of Trump's speech, Nielsen said.\n\nThat would be good news for the ex-president. The early part of his speech, where he spoke dramatically about last Saturday's attempt on his life, was generally regarded as its most effective. As it dragged on past the 90-minute part and past midnight on the East Coast, Trump largely went off-script for remarks that resembled his typical stump speech.\n\nFox News Channel had 9.4 million viewers during Trump's speech, comfortably ahead of any other network. An estimated 72 percent of the viewers were aged 55 and up, Nielsen said.\n\nIt was the most-watched night of the convention, which is typical for the evening when the presidential nominee speaks.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus prides itself on its authority among Democrats and its influence with President Joe Biden in particular. So far, only one of its roughly 60 members have joined calls for Biden to drop his reelection bid due to concerns over his age and ability to win.\n\nBut the caucus' broad backing of the president varies widely, ranging from enthusiastic support to outright skepticism. And a small but growing number within the group are publicly expressing doubts about Biden's candidacy.\n\nBlack voters are widely credited with helping Biden clinch the Democratic nomination four years ago and then defeat Republican Donald Trump. Whether Black lawmakers stick with the president now, and how fervently they do so, could be critical in the coming days as pressure builds from the highest levels of the Democratic Party for Biden to end his campaign.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score":

Good morning, In your 20s and 30s, it\u2019s not uncommon to find your calendar filling up with weddings, bridal and baby showers, graduations and more\u2014events which many feel pressured to buy a different outfit for. But instead of buying clothes for every event I\u2019ve been invited to, I have started renting them. The $6.2 billion global apparel rental market took a hit during the pandemic, but it\u2019s seeing a resurgence, driven by Gen Z and Millennials. Nuuly, a five-year-old clothing rental business from Urban Outfitters, reported last week more than 50% annual sales growth for the first quarter. Rent the Runway, the 15-year-old leader in fashion rentals, beat expectations in its earnings call. In part, customers are driven by cost: Pickle, a peer-to-peer rental platform, says a $300 to $400 dress can be rented for just $30 to $50. But it\u2019s also a more eco-friendly habit than buying brand-new clothing. Let\u2019s get into the headlines, FIRST UP Melinda French Gates Photo by Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for THR Melinda French Gates will donate $1 billion to tackle women\u2019s issues across the globe, including abortion rights in the U.S., the billionaire philanthropist announced in a New York Times op-ed on Tuesday, her first undertaking once she exits the Gates Foundation next month. French Gates, who Forbes estimates is worth $11.1 billion as of Tuesday morning, said she has \u201clong focused on improving contraceptive access overseas,\u201d but after the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs ruling, she said she now feels \u201ccompelled to support reproductive rights here at home.\u201d Home prices soared to a new record in March, driven by a gradual ease in mortgage rates and a housing supply shortage, according to the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index released Tuesday. San Diego continued to report the highest price hike across 20 major metropolitan areas, at 11.1% from last year, followed by New York at 9.2%, Cleveland at 8.8% and Los Angeles at 8.8%. BUSINESS + FINANCE The meme stock rally of 2024 may not be over after all: Shares of GameStop rose about 20% shortly after Tuesday\u2019s market open, after the video game retailer translated the social media-driven stock market gains into a boatload of cash. The latest catalyst for GameStop was its disclosure after Friday\u2019s market close that it raised $933 million from its new equity offering. Still, its stock is 65% below its peak earlier this month and more than 80% below its briefly held 2021 all-time high. Former FTX executive Ryan Salame was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison Tuesday, federal prosecutors said, and must pay more than $11 million in fines, months after pleading guilty to campaign finance and unlicensed money transmitting charges. It\u2019s the first prison sentence for an associate of Sam Bankman-Fried, who is facing a 25-year sentence following his crypto empire\u2019s collapse. When FTX filed for bankruptcy, it was seemingly missing billions of dollars worth of customers\u2019 funds but held $3.4 billion in various cryptocurrencies that the estate would have to sell to satisfy creditors\u2019 claims, likely at hefty discounts to their trading prices. Traders at billionaire Mike Novogratz\u2019 Galaxy Digital bought a hoard of Solana tokens at a steep discount from the crypto exchange, and windfall profits are likely. WEALTH + ENTREPRENEURSHIP Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images Open AI CEO Sam Altman and Phoenix-based private equity investor Jahm Najafi are among the nine philanthropists who joined the Giving Pledge this year, the group announced Tuesday, bringing the total members of the global ultra-rich community who are willing to give away at least half of their fortunes to solving society's problems to 240. Both Altman, worth $1 billion, and Najafi, worth $1.3 billion, pledged to make charity donations alongside their partners, Oliver Mulherin and Cheryl Najafi, respectively. TECH + INNOVATION OpenAI said it has started training its next AI model that will succeed GPT-4, the technology powering its chatbot ChatGPT, as tech companies race to produce increasingly capable AI tools. The company has also created a new committee to evaluate any risks posed by the technology, which will be jointly led by CEO and cofounder Sam Altman, as well as three board members. Nvidia\u2019s CEO and cofounder became a centibillionaire for part of Tuesday afternoon, as shares of the company soared 7% to an all-time high. The artificial intelligence technology architect is closing in on Apple to become the second-most valuable company in the world, as its market capitalization shot up to $2.8 billion, just shy of Apple\u2019s $2.9 trillion. Former OpenAI executive and key researcher Jan Leike on Tuesday announced he has joined AI rival Anthropic, less than two weeks after he resigned over safety concerns, as the ChatGPT maker fends off criticism it is favoring profits over long-term safety. Leike said he is excited to continue the mission of superalignment, an area of research dedicated to ensuring the long-term safety of AI by making sure a yet-to-be-realized form of AI called superintelligence that can outsmart humans is controllable, acts in line with human values and will ultimately not harm humanity. SPORTS + ENTERTAINMENT Photo by Brett Carlsen/Getty Images Shares of DraftKings and FanDuel, the largest mobile sportsbook operators nationwide, tanked after Illinois\u2019 state senate advanced a bill that would up the effective tax rate major sports betting companies face in the state from a flat 15% to a graduated tax structure of up to 40% of gross gambling revenues. The tax increase would eat into $101 million to $134 million of DraftKings\u2019 projected 2025 profits, according to JPMorgan, a crucial blow for a company that\u2019s hoping to deliver its first ever full-year profit next year. TRENDS + EXPLAINERS John Mackey, the colorful cofounder and former CEO of Whole Foods Market, left the grocery chain in 2022, five years after the influential organic foods supermarket he built from scratch was acquired by Amazon. In a recent interview with Forbes, Mackey looked back on his 44-year career building Whole Foods, offered advice for entrepreneurs and shared his thoughts about remote work and labor unions. DAILY COVER STORY A Record Year For America\u2019s Richest Self-Made Women 2024 Uncle Nearest founder Fawn Weaver, singer Katy Perry, ABC Supply Chairman Diane Hendricks. PHOTOS, FROM LEFT: JAMEL TOPPIN FOR FORBES, ART STREIBER/DISNEY; GABRIELA HASBUN FOR FORBES TOPLINE Pizza. Packaging. Pop music. The country\u2019s most successful self-made women have found dozens of ways to prosper. Nearly three-fourths of the 100 women on Forbes\u2019 tenth annual list of America\u2019s Richest Self-Made Women started or cofounded a company, while 22 are chief executives or co-chief executives. A healthy stock market helped push the combined fortunes of list members to a record $154 billion, up nearly 25% from 2023. The minimum to qualify rose to $300 million, up from $225 million from last year, the highest since Forbes started tracking the top 100 in 2020. Seventy-three members are richer than they were in 2023, while just ten saw their fortunes fall. Billionaire Diane Hendricks keeps the top spot for the seventh consecutive year with a record $20.9 billion fortune, up from $15 billion last year. She owns roofing and building supply distributor ABC Supply, which she founded with her husband Ken (d. 2007) in 1982. Hendricks is the biggest gainer this year in dollar terms, up $5.9 billion from a year ago, helped by a 10% increase in ABC Supply\u2019s 2023 revenues. In percentage terms, the biggest gainer is Elizabeth Uihlein, whose fortune is up 81% to an estimated $6.7 billion. Uihlein and her husband Richard founded packaging supplies firm Uline in 1980. The jump in her net worth is due to Forbes having more information about revenues at the privately held company, as well as a higher valuation tied to stronger market conditions. Eleven new faces joined the ranks. The highest profile newcomer is singer Katy Perry, worth an estimated $350 million, mostly due to the September 2023 sale of her music catalog. Fawn Weaver, owner of the fastest-growing whiskey brand in American history, Uncle Nearest, makes her debut, as does money manager Joan Payden, who launched her firm Payden & Rygel in 1983 and remains CEO at age 92. There are a record 31 billionaires on the list, up from 24 last year, including three newcomers to the ranking. WHY IT MATTERS \u201cForbes first created this list in 2015 to shine a light on women entrepreneurs, executives and entertainers who were super successful but not getting the kind of attention they would if they were on our billionaires list,\u201d says Forbes Assistant Managing Editor Kerry Dolan. \u201cIn the process, we have learned about women in a broad array of industries, from one who started a drug company to find a cure for her daughter\u2019s terminal illness to another who founded a chain of centers to treat children with autism, to others who have founded and sold cosmetics companies. The hope is that these women will serve as role models for a new generation who may follow in their footsteps.\u201d MORE How To Build A Whiskey Unicorn FACTS + COMMENTS T-Mobile will buy most of U.S. Cellular\u2019s operations in a deal valued at $4.4 billion, both companies announced Tuesday.

Some of the most important skills include strategic thinking (which AI still can\u2019t do), as well as intentional communication, or the ability to create a well-thought-out message that considers the needs of your audience, context, and your desired outcome. Data and leadership skills are also critical, as is having a sense of humor.

That\u2019s what the relationship between France and the United States exemplifies,\u201d Biden said in remarks with Macron from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. The visit comes as the US has strengthened its alliance with its oldest ally amid Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, even as some signs of fissures have emerged over the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East. \u201cWhen we stand as one, our countries are stronger and literally, the world is safer,\u201d Biden said during a state dinner later Saturday. \u201cWe stand at an inflection point in history. The decisions we make now will determine the course of our future for decades to come.\u201d The state visit began with Macron and French first lady Brigitte Macron welcoming Biden and first lady Jill Biden with a formal ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, a Paris landmark. The leaders paid their respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and placed the end of a large sword into the eternal flame. A French military choir performed \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d followed by \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201d Biden and Macron observed a flyover before greeting officials from a French delegation as bagpipes played \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d The Bidens and Macrons signed a guestbook before boarding their respective vehicles, which drove slowly down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, flanked by military personnel and American and French flags. The normally bustling Parisian thoroughfare was emptied of pedestrians, with significant road closures affecting the area. Biden described Saturday\u2019s arrival ceremony as a \u201cmoving experience.\u201d \u201cIt was a moving experience for a student of history to be at the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9e today \u2013 that was a moving experience for us, the whole delegation,\u201d he said.

Evan Vucci/AP Upon arriving at the \u00c9lsy\u00e9e Palace, the French president\u2019s official residence, the leaders posed for photos before beginning a working lunch. In the evening, the Macrons welcomed the Bidens back to the palace for a state dinner. Macron is returning the favor to Biden, who hosted the French president for a state visit at the White House in December 2022, the administration\u2019s first. Biden noted that the US celebrates Independence Day, the Fourth of July, next month. \u201cThat feat would not have been possible \u2026 were it not for France coming to our aid. We\u2019re a nation because of France, in large part. You stepped up when we needed help,\u201d he said. France, Biden said, \u201cwas our first friend. Remains one of our best friends.\u201d \u201cToday, I proudly stand with France and support freedom and democracy around the world. That\u2019s what this spectacular week is all about,\u201d he said. There has been much for the leaders to discuss. Macron, like other US allies, has privately questioned the future of US leadership in the world should Biden lose the November election to former President Donald Trump, with whom he had a more complicated relationship. Biden has frequently recalled meeting with world leaders early in his term during a G7 gathering where he pronounced, \u201cAmerica is back.\u201d \u201cAnd the French leader looked at me, and he said, \u2018For how long?\u2019\u201d Biden said to laughter at a March fundraiser in New York City. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t humorous. He said \u2013 he was serious, \u2018For how long?\u2019\u201d Biden has often pointed to those anxieties among his counterparts as he makes the case for a second term, though Europe has also had to contend with its own rising tide of populism. On the topic of Ukraine, both countries have touted their support for the war-torn country. Biden on Friday announced a new $225 billion aid package while apologizing to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the congressional delay. And for his part, Macron has been one of the key leaders in Europe\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. France has doubled its defense budget, announced it would surpass NATO\u2019s 2% defense spending benchmark and restarted domestic production of critical military inputs. Biden pointed to both countries\u2019 support for Ukraine as an example of their close relationship. \u201cWe know what happens if (Russian President Vladimir) Putin succeeds in subjugating Ukraine. \u2026 And we know Putin isn\u2019t going to stop at Ukraine \u2013 it\u2019s not just Ukraine, it\u2019s about much more than Ukraine. All of Europe will be threatened. We\u2019re not gonna let that happen,\u201d Biden said. On the Israel-Hamas war, Macron endorsed a ceasefire proposal laid out by Biden, writing in a post on X last week, \u201cThe war in Gaza must end. We support the US proposal for a durable peace.\u201d But France broke with Western allies last month as its Foreign Ministry expressed support for the International Criminal Court\u2019s decision to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Biden had called the ICC\u2019s decision \u201coutrageous.\u201d Both Macron and Biden on Saturday welcomed the news of the rescue of four Israeli hostages who were taken captive by Hamas on October 7, with Biden using the moment to press for the ceasefire proposal he detailed last week. \u201cWe won\u2019t stop working until all the hostages are home and a ceasefire is reached,\u201d the president said. The US-French relationship has dramatically improved from a low point early in the Biden administration. In September 2021, Macron took the extraordinary step of recalling his ambassador to Washington over a US-Australia submarine deal that blindsided the French and cost them a multibillion-dollar defense contract. \u201cThey have a warm and close relationship,\u201d National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Friday evening. \u201cOne of the things the president respects and admires about President Macron is he\u2019s as honest and forthright as President Joe Biden is. That\u2019s what he wants to see in a friend, in an ally.\u201d Biden and Macron were also set to discuss deepening maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, with an announcement expected to build law enforcement capacity and increase US-France technical cooperation on port security, Kirby said. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see that we are as close as we have ever been with our French allies,\u201d Kirby added.

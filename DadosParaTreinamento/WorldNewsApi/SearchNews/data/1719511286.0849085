But they don\u2019t normally have a commander-in-chief in attendance. Former President Barack Obama surprised volunteers at the Saturday service project, where community members placed American flags at more than 4,000 graves to mark Memorial Day. The crowd of veterans and local scouts mingled with the 44th president as he helped with the effort. Alexandria National Cemetery is one of the first 14 national cemeteries established in 1862 and is the final resting place of service members dating back to the American Civil War. \u201cOne of the greatest honors of my life was the privilege of serving as commander-in-chief, and with pride also came sometimes heartbreak and loss,\u201d he told attendees ahead of the morning event. \u201cAnd the sober recognition of the sacrifices that so many Americans and their families have made to preserve our freedom. \u201cAs we go out here, I hope that we just reflect and say a prayer for and say thanks for those who came before us. And for those of you who are still serving those of you who may be serving in the future, thanks to you as well.\u201d Obama was also joined by Veterans Affairs Deputy Secretary Tanya Bradsher and Deputy Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs VA Glenn Powers at the event. Federal officials are appearing at a host of Memorial Day events this weekend. VA Secretary Denis McDonough is scheduled to speak at the New York Veterans Cemetery Finger Lakes in Waterloo, New York, on May 27. The town, dubbed the \u201cbirthplace of Memorial Day,\u201d first marked the holiday in 1866. VA Chief of Staff Kimberly Jackson is scheduled to speak during ceremonies at Wood National Cemetery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on May 27. Bradsher is also scheduled to speak at Baltimore National Cemetery in Maryland on May 30.", "summary": "Obama joined local veterans groups and scouts in a volunteer event at a Virginia cemetery ahead of Memorial Day.", "url": "https://www.armytimes.com/veterans/2024/05/26/former-president-obama-surprises-volunteers-at-memorial-day-event/", "image": "https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/iX_2_b84sfHtsTnMmA9EqR0-7iQ=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/GKSJNPHSKVDR5LC7VX5EFQ5SSE.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:30:23", "author": "Leo Shane III", "authors": ["Leo Shane III"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.3}

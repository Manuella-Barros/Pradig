Because of the conveniences of digital banking, e-commerce and other online services, people's lives are now simpler and more accessible. But this ease comes with a major drawback: making individuals and businesses vulnerable to fraud. Many applications and platforms hold a plethora of viable data, including personal and financial information. Regrettably, fraudsters are using this digital convenience for their own gain, resulting in a significant increase in identity theft, synthetic identities, deep fakes, online payment fraud and account takeovers. Undoubtedly, generative AI is a transformative technology with a dark side that must be recognized and dealt with effectively. This sophisticated technology is helping fraudsters create synthetic identities, deepfakes and digital injection attacks, spawning new business challenges. Unregulated Technologies And Synthetic Identities: The New Form Of Compromises Identity theft has become a concern across the globe, impacting more than 42 million individuals in 2021, accounting for around $52 billion in the U.S. during that year. With the emergence of generative AI, the banking sector and other businesses are facing a new and more complex risk: synthetic identity fraud (SIF).

In contrast, synthetic identity fraud involves creating an entirely new person who doesn't exist legally by combining stolen, manipulated and fictitious personally identifiable information along with bogus facial imprints. How Synthetic Identities Are Created Here is how criminals harness the power of AI to create synthetic identities. 1. Cybercriminals create forged ID documents containing a mix of real, stolen and fake information (for instance, an ID card number combined with an entirely forged name and slightly altered address). 2. Scammers then develop synthetic imagery matching the legal ID document photo to manipulate KYC systems. Synthetic identities are a newly emerged fraud variation that manipulates ID verification and facial biometric authentication systems. However, present data checks for customer identity verification are no longer viable to detect fraud. Fighting such attempts requires robust biometric verification along with rigid document verification checks. Generative AI: A Growing Threat AI is not intrinsically harmful; there are many positive applications, too. Some of the factors that make the use of AI questionable are as follows. \u2022 Growth Of Crime-As-A-Service: Easy access to online generative AI tools is helping scammers reshape the fraud ecosystem. AI is assisting criminals in committing deepfake and spoofing attacks faster and on a broader scale. In case these attacks succeed, they can multiply in volume and are shared among crime networks or over the dark web. \u2022 Public Perception And Disinformation: Generative AI impacts organizations, individuals, government, the information landscape and the world\u2019s economy, creating adverse real-world effects. In 2023, the stock market was negatively affected by an AI-generated image of an explosion at the Pentagon that went viral. Presentation Attacks Vs. Digital Injection Attacks Tens of variations in presentation attacks exist that AI-backed criminals can deploy to unlawfully access victims\u2019 accounts or financial information. Scammers also try to impersonate a real user using an artifact held up to a camera. In addition to these techniques, criminals can develop a deepfake that effectively manipulates the facial biometric verification procedure. Digital injection attacks involve the same technology as deepfake but leverage a video, injecting it into the victim\u2019s data stream while taking over the account. However, deepfakes become more adverse when carried out using digital injection attacks, as they can scale and automate more robustly than presentation attacks. How Synthetic IDs Add More Complexity And Risk Before the surge in digitization, identity theft was restricted to one person presenting a stolen identity at a time. The fraud process was slow, and the intelligence of in-house employees was key to detecting and mitigating such fraud risks. With the increase in the creation of synthetic IDs and the rise of digital presentation or injection attacks, cybercriminals can defraud businesses and individuals on a large scale. Using synthetic identities, criminals can produce countless identities that they can impersonate to gain unauthorized access. Using AI, potentially hundreds of these attacks can be launched from any part of the world to reap illicit benefits. As manipulation techniques become more sophisticated, scalable and automated, it's crucial to highlight that the human eye cannot always detect such attempts. That is why businesses should integrate cutting-edge facial biometric verification systems to fight deepfakes. Deepfake and generative AI technologies have become potent tools for fraudsters capable of exploiting real footage to create fabricated content. Recently, a deepfake video was widely circulated over the internet showing Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong marketing a fake crypto investment platform allegedly designed by Elon Musk. This video was a manipulation of a real interview on CGTN. Combating Synthetic Identities With More Robust ID Scanning With bad actors leveraging combinations of fake and real information to create synthetic identity documents, a traditional facial scan will no longer suffice. That\u2019s where an AI-backed facial biometric verification can capture, extract and authenticate identities in real time while mitigating the risk of deepfakes and other fraudulent activities. Businesses can onboard customers with utmost confidence by implementing a data-driven approach that includes non-forensic and forensic inspection of multiple ID document types and 3D liveness detection that forms an almost fool-proof biometric check. The continuous learning and flexibility of artificial intelligence algorithms and AI-driven identity verification solutions ensure that they can extract and verify vast types of IDs across multiple jurisdictions, enabling businesses to offer user-centric and transparent services while not compromising security and trust. Finding Suitable Tech Partners The combination of scammers and IDs, synthetic identities, deepfakes and generative AI poses a significant risk to the digital ecosystem. Without the right technology stack to help companies protect their integrity against the sophistication of AI-generative fraudulent schemes, they can be exposed to financial crimes, non-compliance fines, sanctions and reputational damages. Therefore, it's important to look for technology partners that can help you mitigate this type of fraud.

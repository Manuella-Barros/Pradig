{"id": 244102420, "title": "Tim Dowling: the alarm engineer is here. Could he not at least pretend the problem isn\u2019t my doing?", "text": "I am working in my office shed when my wife texts, ordering me to sit in the house in case the alarm service engineer turns up. I obey, in the hope of finally being freed from torment. The burglar alarm has been going off at random moments: sometimes at four in the morning, sometimes at two in the afternoon. It can happen on consecutive nights, or it may stay quiet for a week. The noise is not the alarm actually going off \u2013 it\u2019s just some kind of warning chirp. But it\u2019s loud enough to wake you up, and to make it stop you have to go down to the hall and type in a four-digit code. Every time, some kind of explanation would flit across its glowing screen \u2013 but it always went dark before I could read the whole thing. \u201cI can\u2019t live like this,\u201d I would always say as I came back to bed. But it turned out I could: this has been going on since February. The chirps are random enough, and infrequent enough, to think that every time might be the last. By degrees we went mad. The engineer arrives in the middle of lunch. He is wearing a uniform and carrying a toolkit. \u201cThank God you\u2019ve come,\u201d I say, my mouth still full. We show him the box in the hall and try to explain. \u201cIt can happen at any time, day or night,\u201d my wife says. \u201cThe panel says something about a fault,\u201d I say. \u201cBedroom, panic, then it goes dark.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll just take a look at the fault log,\u201d the engineer says. My wife and I return to the kitchen table, but lunch now feels over. The engineer comes in. \u201cI\u2019ve examined the unit\u2019s fault log, and unfortunately it thinks it\u2019s 2009,\u201d he says. He has a bushy beard and speaks in the stilted cadences of a BBC Open University lecturer. \u201cThat is unfortunate,\u201d my wife says. \u201cSo I\u2019ve reset that,\u201d says the engineer. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll now move on to the next diagnostic level.\u201d When he goes back into the hall, my wife turns to me. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me alone with him,\u201d she says. A sequence of different distress chirps sounds. In between each, the engineer leans his head into the room and raises his eyebrows. \u201cNo,\u201d my wife says. \u201cNot that one.\u201d Finally, we hear it: two shrill notes, followed by a pause and a third low note. My wife screams. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d I say. \u201cBedroom panic something.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d says the engineer. \u201cThat is normally associated with a low battery in an unwired sensor.\u201d \u201cIt says panic and bedroom on the thing,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I will check that for you in due course,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I have here a list of all the sensors in the house, and only three are unwired.\u201d \u201cWhere did you get that list?\u201d my wife says. \u201cSo, one on your kitchen window. One on the kitchen door, and one for the conservatory.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have a conservatory,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve already made a note of that here,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we just need to locate the radio base unit.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d my wife says. \u201cAnd here it is,\u201d he says, reaching above the door of the cupboard to remove the unit\u2019s cover. \u201cAnd that is telling me nothing at the moment.\u201d \u201cOh good,\u201d my wife says. \u201cNo problem, just bear with me while I reset the timer on the control panel,\u201d he says. After, he leaves the room, my wife and I observe a moment\u2019s silence. \u201cI have to work,\u201d I say. \u201cStay where you are,\u201d she says. Half a dozen other possible faults are eliminated, and narrated. This includes my theory that something is amiss with the bedroom panic button. \u201cI\u2019ve checked that for you now,\u201d the engineer says. \u201cAnd there are no problems there.\u201d \u201cThat was what the thing said, though,\u201d I say. \u201cBy the process of elimination, that leaves us with a low battery situation,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you when they were last changed,\u201d my wife says. \u201cFive years ago,\u201d he says. He\u2019s right: when he removes the batteries they each have a date from 2019 written on the side in felt tip. \u201cI have zero memory of that,\u201d I say. The low batteries, he tells us, would account for the randomness of the alarm\u2019s chirp: the base unit only checks in with the sensors periodically, and they are only sometimes too weak to respond. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d my wife says. \u201cSorry to sound like morons.\u201d \u201cDefiant morons,\u201d I say. \u201cOne more thing,\u201d my wife says. \u201cCan you show us how to turn it on?\u201d", "summary": "<p>Irregular bleeps have been driving me to distraction for months.

Analysts are debating whether Big Blue can recapture the momentum it had earlier this year.\n\nIBM stock, which is part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, has gained 14.5% this year as of early Wednesday, roughly in line with gains by the broader S&P 500. But the shares are off about 5% from a high near 199 that the stock reached in March.\n\nShares of the more-than-century-old tech giant rallied starting late last year. The company's growing backlog for AI-related work convinced investors that the technology could power new growth for the company.\n\nWhile OpenAI's ChatGPT launched the generative AI hype, IBM brought attention to AI more than a decade ago with its Jeopardy!-winning Watson supercomputer. IBM is now offering broader enterprise AI services under the title WatsonX.\n\nBut a so-so first quarter earnings report in April and broader concerns about the market for IT spending set IBM back from spring highs. The stock has begun to recover in recent weeks, however. Here's what to know about IBM stock heading into the report:\n\nIBM Q2 By The Numbers\n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet project that IBM will post adjusted earnings of $2.18 per share for the June-ended quarter, flat from the same quarter a year earlier. Sales are projected to rise 1% to $15.62 billion.\n\nWith its first quarter earnings statement in April, IBM affirmed its previous full-year guidance for mid-single-digit revenue growth for 2024 and $12 billion in free cash flow.\n\nIBM's two most closely watched divisions are its software and consulting businesses. In Q1, software contributed 41% of IBM's total revenue, while consulting made up 36% of IBM's sales.\n\nIBM Stock Named To Evercore Watchlist\n\nAhead of the report, analysts at Evercore ISI placed IBM on the firm's Tactical Outperform watchlist. The firm cited the company's \"muted stock price performance\" of late compared to what it views as improving fundamentals. Those factors could allow IBM to outperform tempered expectations, in Evercore's view.\n\n\"We expect the company to report moderate upside vs. consensus revenue/EPS estimates ($15.6B/$2.18 per share),\" Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani wrote. \"Our sense is that, while the enterprise IT spending backdrop remains cautious (excluding AI), we think a combination of Red Hat acceleration, improving consulting fundamentals, and initial AI momentum to drive better-than-expected results and improving trends for the balance of (2024).\"\n\nRed Hat is an open-source software firm IBM acquired for $34 billion in 2019.\n\nStill, other IBM bulls are more cautious coming into the report. BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan rates IBM stock a buy, reiterating that call in a recent earnings preview note to clients. But he said there are risks ahead.\n\n\"Gen AI ($1 billion backlog) is a meaningful opportunity for both consulting and software,\" Mohan wrote. \"However IBM also faces headwinds, including (a) soft macro environment and back-end loaded profitability with tough compares in (Q4).\"\n\nIBM's AI Exuberance 'Priced In'?\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts, meanwhile, hold an equal-weight rating for IBM stock.\n\n\"With valuation back to near 10-year highs, we believe the market is already pricing in exuberance around accelerating software growth, growing Gen AI bookings, and the potential for modest EPS upside,\" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in a recent client note.\n\nHowever, the market may not have yet priced in a slowdown for consulting growth, which is a \"key risk\" coming into the report, according to Woodring.\n\nIBD MarketSurge shows that IBM stock has formed a cup base, with a potential buy point of 199.18.\n\nMeanwhile, IBM stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 79 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nAmazon Hit This Milestone In The Andy Jassy Era.

Consulting, No. 6 on CRN's 2024 Solution Provider 500, disappointed Bernstein last quarter, the firm sees \"some potential improvement in\" demand, according to the firm's report.\n\nConsulting rival Accenture \"had strong bookings,\" up 22 percent year over year with $900 million in AI bookings, while HCLTech saw \"stronger backlog realization.\" Bernstein expects IBM to \"increasingly benefit from nearly $1B in AI consulting signings.\"\n\nConsulting firms overall have said \"that demand remains relatively weak,\" according to the Bernstein report. \"We note that while IBM has continued to grow above peers, its growth premium has narrowed, and the business could be sensitive to industry level dynamics.\"\n\nBernstein analysts will watch for \"key leading indicators like book:bill and signings as well as commentary on the consulting strategic partnerships and AI book of business,\" according to the report.\n\nTraction in IBM's AI consulting business \"could be a potential leading indicator for enterprise AI more broadly,\" according to Bernstein.\n\n\"IBM has stated that its AI consulting book of business is approaching $1B (vs. a total backlog of ~$30B) if half is ultimately

consultants to help deploy AI/LLMs.\"\n\nIn a July 18 Morgan Stanley report, the firm said that IBM could cut guidance to the consulting business for the second time in a row.\n\nActive IBM Consulting daily job postings have fallen 34 percent from the end of the first quarter and the 90-day rolling average fell 29 percent from the February 2024 peak, a negative sign for the business, according to

checks have pointed to a continued challenging Consulting spending environment, and we see discretionary spending still at-risk (Services is still a budget share donor to help fund Gen AI projects), while Generative AI consulting projects don't appear to be having any material incremental impact on Consulting growth today,\" according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nMorgan Stanley's latest quarterly CIOs survey showed that IBM was less willing to discount on consulting prices compared with rivals, especially ones with large presence in India including Tata Consultancy Services, HCLTech, Wipro and Cognizant Technology Solutions.\n\n\"IBM's net negative discounting score in our 2Q24 survey implies IBM continues to command a premium for its consultative services,\" according to Morgan

Revenue for the period rose 2% to $15.77 billion, easily beating the Street's target of $15.62 billion.\n\nAll told, IBM showed a net profit of $1.83 billion, rising from the $1.58 billion profit it posted a year earlier.\n\nIBM Chief Executive Arvind Krishna (pictured) said in a statement that the company's book of business for generative AI has grown to more than $2 billion, boosted by the launch of its watsonx development platform one year ago.\n\n\"Given our first-half results, we are raising our full-year view of free cash flow, which we now expect to be more than $12 billion,\" Krishna said. Three months earlier, during its previous earnings call, the company said it was expecting free cash flow of more or less $12 billion by the end of the year.\n\n\"We remain confident in the positive macro outlook for technology spending,\" Krishna told analysts on a conference call.\n\nIn recent months, IBM has focused on expanding the watsonx platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI chatbots and enhance the code for other AI programs. In addition, it recently open-sourced its Granite family of large language models in an effort to popularize some of its other AI services.\n\nTejas Dessai, a research analyst at Global X, told Reuters that the \"commercialization of generative AI is accelerating, positioning diversified enterprise technology companies like IBM to capitalize on the growing demand for AI integration\"\n\nKrishna told analysts on the call that the company continues to suffer from the impact of higher interest rates and inflation, explaining that the \"geopolitical uncertainty\" caused by conflict in Ukraine and Israel has gone on for longer than many people had expected.\n\n\"That weighs into people's heads, about what that might happen, and specifically the war in Europe, as well as the war in the Middle East,\" Krishna said.\n\nIBM's main business units continued to tick over nicely though, despite the uncertainty elsewhere in the world. The company reported revenue of $6.74 billion in its software business, up 7% from a year ago and ahead of the Street's forecast of $6.49 billion.\n\nWithin that segment, Red Hat posted growth of 7%, which was another relatively slow quarter for the acquired software business that was once consistently growing at more than 20% per quarter. However, Krishna said bookings for Red Hat increased in the quarter, a promising sign for the remainder of the year.\n\nIBM's consulting unit bagged $5.18 billion in revenue, down 1% from a year earlier and just below the Street's target of $5.23 billion. Meanwhile, the infrastructure segment, which includes IBM's iconic mainframe computers, generated $3.65 billion in sales, up 0.8% and ahead of the Street's consensus estimate of $5.31 billion. IBM's chief financial officer Jim Kavanaugh said on the call that the current generation z16 mainframe computer continued to outperform previous sales cycles.\n\nThe growing importance of IBM's software business is the culmination of a years-long transition that saw it pivot from being a legacy hardware company to one that's focused on high-growth software and services. IBM has been making efforts to accelerate that transition, and in April it announced plans to buy the \"infrastructure-as-code\" software giant HashiCorp Inc. for $6.4 billion\n\nIn an update last week, HashiCorp revealed that regulators have requested more information about the planned acquisition. That suggests that the transaction approval process could be delayed by increased regulatory scrutiny, though there has been no indication of any opposition to the deal so far. Krishna told analysts that he remains \"quite confident\" the deal will close before the calendar year is out.\n\nDuring the quarter, IBM also announced a new partnership with Palo Alto Networks Inc. The security firm will acquire IBM's QRadar software-as-a-service assets and become IBM's preferred cybersecurity partner across network, cloud and security operations, it said.\n\nPrior to today's gains, IBM's stock was up 14% in the year to date, more or less in-line with the broader S&P 500 index.", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Krishna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Krishna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainframe computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macro (computer science)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Hat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial analyst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HashiCorp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HashiCorp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software as a service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Publicly_Traded", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Publicly Traded", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/07/Krishna-768x512.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760712", "eventUri": "eng-9760712", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

What to watch for:\n\nGUIDANCE: Along with its last report, IBM guided for fiscal 2024 constant currency revenue growth in the mid-single digits. Currently, Wall Street expects IBm to report FY24 revenue of $63.03B. Meanwhile, analysts expect the company to report Q2 earnings per share of $2.20 on revenue of $15.62B.\n\nHASHICORP DEAL: The same day it reported Q1 results, IBM announced that it agreed to acquire HashiCorp (HCP) for $35 per share in cash, or a total enterprise value of $6.4B. HashiCorp will be acquired with available cash on hand. The boards of directors of IBM and HashiCorp have both approved the transaction. The acquisition is subject to approval by HashiCorp shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The company's largest shareholders and investors, who collectively hold approximately 43% of the voting power of HashiCorp's outstanding common stock, entered into a voting agreement with IBM pursuant to which each has agreed to vote all of their common shares in favor of the transaction and against any alternative transactions. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2024, the company said at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, HashiCorp said in a regulatory fifling earlier this month that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is seeking mor information about the accquisition. \"On July 12, 2024, HashiCorp and IBM each received a request for additional information and documentary material from the Federal Trade Commission in connection with the FTC's review of the Merger,\" the company said in the filing. \"The issuance of the Second Request extends the waiting period under the HSR Act until 30 days after both HashiCorp and IBM have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the FTC or extended by agreement of HashiCorp and IBM. HashiCorp and IBM expect to promptly respond to the Second Request and to continue working cooperatively with the FTC as it conducts its review of the Merger. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2024.\"\n\nEVERCORE ISI: Last week, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani added IBM to the firm's \"Tactical Outperform\" list ahead of the company's June-end quarter results announcement due after market close on July 24, based on improving fundamentals for Redhat and Consulting, combined with muted stock price performance. The firm's sense is that, while the enterprise IT spending backdrop remains cautious, it thinks a combination of Redhat acceleration from share gains due to disruption at competitors, improving Consulting fundamentals, and initial AI momentum can drive better than expected results and it expects the company to report moderate upside to consensus revenue and EPS estimates, the analyst told investors. Evercore has an Outperform rating and $215 price target on IBM shares.\n\nGOLDMAN INITIATION: In late June, Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of IBM with a Buy rating and $200 price target. The firm initiated the Americas IT services sector and is positive on a select group of names citing their secular and cyclical opportunities. The industry is in the midst of a cyclical correction driven by IT spending constraints from macro pressures across a range of industry verticals and a near-term shift in spending priorities toward artificial intelligence-focused capex and away from software and services, the analyst told investors in a research note. The firm believes IBM is on a path to successfully complete its pivot to long-term growth, driven by an improving mix of infrastructure software assets focused on open-source and AI offerings aimed at driving enterprise business transformation.", "source": {"uri": "thefly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thefly.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HashiCorp", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "HashiCorp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haut_Commissariat_au_Plan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haut Commissariat au Plan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enterprise value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High-speed rail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Hat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macro (computer science)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://image.thefly.com/catalog/201810/img_90.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760712", "eventUri": "eng-9760712", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 96, "textEnd": 103, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-07-", "textStart": 1492, "textEnd": 1499}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The firm anticipates challenges in software growth due to tougher comparisons, and in consulting, which missed revenue expectations and saw a lowered guidance in the first quarter.\n\nFurthermore, Jefferies does not expect AI to make a significant contribution to the software sector this year.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0fTrack your favorite companies with InvestingPro! Our Summer Sale is now on, use coupon code INVPRODEAL and save over 50%!\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nIBM, often referred to as 'Big Blue', is seen as a slow-moving entity, with Wall Street predicting just 1% total revenue growth in 2Q and a 15% free cash flow (FCF) margin. The sluggish growth expectations are largely due to the consulting segment, where other industry players such as Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (NASDAQ:CTSH), and Infosys (NYSE:INFY) have reported ongoing uncertainty over discretionary spending projects.\n\nSoftware growth is projected to be 2.5% year-on-year, almost three times the overall revenue growth in 2Q. As IBM transitions towards a software-led model, the company's software performance is considered crucial for driving more substantial bottom-line growth. Software accounted for 40% of total revenue but approximately two-thirds of pre-tax income in CY23.\n\nIn 2Q, the software business is expected to contribute the majority of overall growth, as well as in FY24. The consensus estimate for software revenue in 2Q is $6.5 billion, representing a 2.5% year-on-year growth.\n\nJefferies emphasized the importance of strong execution in the Red Hat business and the successful integration of HCP for achieving sustainable software growth.\n\nThe consulting business growth expectations are relatively muted due to weaker near-term demand. However, Jefferies believes that AI will significantly benefit the consulting sector in the short term, with IBM recording over $1 billion of AI bookings over the last three quarters, primarily weighted towards consulting.\n\nAnalysts deemed the risk/reward as balanced, with IBM shares trading at 20 times CY25E EPS, compared to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at 32 times and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) at 28 times.\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies maintained their 'Hold' rating for IBM with a price target of $190.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u201322_UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021\u201322 UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accenture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognizant", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cognizant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosys", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infosys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Hat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Software_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Software Engineering", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Manufacturing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Manufacturing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/IBM_800x533_L_1412236885.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760712", "eventUri": "eng-9760712", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

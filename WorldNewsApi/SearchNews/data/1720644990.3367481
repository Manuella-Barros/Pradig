They said: \"I've got a flight in a few days and recently bought a power bank that's 115Wh was wondering if it were allowed to go through security in my backpack on the plane. \"I'm aware I'm allowed to bring power banks on the plane but was wondering if there were even the slightest chance it'd be stopped by security. \"I searched online and couldn't find any rulings from the EU or Ireland, beyond needing operator permission.\" Answering the question, one user said \"The maximum level of power allowed for hand luggage on flights is 100Wh.\" If your power bank is over this limit, it needs to be in your cabin baggage and you can't use it in flight. While going through the security check, officers may confiscate your power bank if it is over the limit. The best course of action if you are unsure about bringing power banks or other electronic on board when flying abroad, is to contact the flight operator that you are flying with. If you power bank is below 100Wh, it is fine to carry in your hand luggage.

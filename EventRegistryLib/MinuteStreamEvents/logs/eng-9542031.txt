Diddy' Combs Had 'No Plans' to Help Danity Kane After 'Making the Band,' His Bodyguard Says", "body": "All eyes are on hip-hop superstar Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs following the Homeland Security raid on two of his homes in March 2024. Since the raid, fans remember his ex-girlfriend Cassie's allegations against him. Additionally, the all-girl group Danity Kane, formed on Combs' MTV series Making the Band, has spoken out against Combs' actions. Here's what Combs' bodyguard, Gene Deal, said about Combs never having a plan for Danity Kane to make it big in the industry.\n\nMTV's Making the Band gave Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs a reality TV platform in the early 2000s. The show gave Combs the power to form pop groups from budding young stars. Danity Kane was formed during Making the Band 3 in 2005, and the all-girl group became a pop sensation after the show. When Danity Kane released their first album, they sold 109,000 copies on its release day. The group included pop stars Aundrea Fimbres, Shannon Bex, Dawn Richard, D. Woods, and the most outspoken member, Aubrey O'Day.\n\nO'Day discussed Combs firing her multiple times, and she also claimed he mistreated her when they worked together. She's not the only one who discussed Combs' bad behavior. According to his ex-bodyguard, Gene Deal, Diddy never planned to help any bands created by Making the Band achieve real success in the music industry.\n\n\"He had no plans,\" Deal said in an interview with The Art of Dialogue. \"That was all for an MTV show. He had no plans for them -- not at all. He really had no plans for Danity Kane, and they sold records.\"\n\nDeal went on to say that Combs became angry when Danity Kane's friends and family grew upset with him. \"He said, 'Yo, they keep effing with me, I'm [going to] drug all them up ...,'\" Deal recalled Combs said. \" ... So, he didn't have no real plans for them. Not at all. You see what happened after the MTV show went off. If you had plans for them, you're the super producer; somebody should've been alright.\"\n\nThe five members of Danity Kane spoke out against Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs and the treatment of others in the music industry. Dawn Richard spoke to Cosmopolitan about how men \"were always belittling\" women in the entertainment world.\n\n\"I always thought that we were always put in situations where men in the industry were always belittling us and pitting us against each other,\" Richard said. \"That was a lot of the reason why we would fight. We would fight for our own validity.\"\n\nRichard and Aubrey O'Day discussed when Combs fired O'Day. Combs called O'Day \"promiscuous\" as one reason for the firing.\n\n\"It wasn't about her being 'promiscuous,'\" Richard recalled. \"It was about the power to prove, 'I own your career.'\n\nRichard added that Combs wanted people to know, \"'This is my show, this is my s***, and I want to prove to you that it's my s***, and I'm going to show you how much power I have over you by saying I'm going to control your lives.' It's so much bigger than that even though, you're right, it was extremely sexist.\"\n\nSean \"P. Diddy\" Combs returned the Bad Boy Records publishing rights to the musicians on the label, but Danity Kane member Aubrey O'Day wasn't impressed. According to O'Day, Combs wanted her to sign an NDA after giving her the music rights. She didn't sign.\n\n\"We only get the amounts due since Sony bought our catalog. So, streaming for the past couple of years. It's about $800-900. In the hundreds,\" she said on the Only Stans podcast. \"In order to get that, I have to release him for any claims or wrongdoings or actions prior to the date of the release. I have to sign an NDA that I will never disparage Puff, Bad Boy, Janice Combs, or Justin Combs music, or EMI, or Sony ever in public.\"\n\nHow to get help: In the U.S., call the RAINN National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 to connect with a trained staff member from a sexual assault service provider in your area.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_weiler@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Lauren Weiler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Girl group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_the_Band", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Making the Band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_O'Day", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aubrey O'Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danity_Kane", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Danity Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aundrea_Fimbres", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aundrea Fimbres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Bex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shannon Bex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D.

Danity Kane, a girl group featuring Aubrey O'Day, found major commercial success after attaining fame from the series. Unfortunately, O'Day didn't have a great experience with Combs. Here's what she said about how she thought he may have been stalking her at home.\n\nMaking the Band star Aubrey O'Day isn't afraid to discuss Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs. Homeland Security raided two of Combs' properties in late March 2024. Before the raids, Combs' ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, alleged in a lawsuit that Combs was sexually violent toward her. Combs and Ventura quickly settled the lawsuit, and O'Day commented that Combs never took accountability for his actions.\n\nIn 2008, Combs fired O'Day from his label, Bad Boy Records. Since then, O'Day has talked about her personal experiences on the MTV reality series and with Combs. In February 2024, she discussed on the No Jumper podcast how Combs might have been stalking her. O'Day and the podcast host talked about how several people around Combs died of mysterious causes, which made O'Day worry.\n\n\"I have over 600 license plates screen capped in my phone right now from the past three months of just random cars that were parked outside my home that didn't look right to me,\" O'Day explained. \"I've never seen them on my block. Or, I'll make a quick U-turn if I need to get some groceries and a big car busts a U-turn in a really weird spot. It's like, there are things that I know to look out for because I've been followed before in multiple settings, that I'm noticing.\"\n\nWhile speaking on No Jumper, Aubrey O'Day said she wasn't surprised by Cassie Ventura's lawsuit against Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs, especially after Combs's record label, Bad Boy Records, turned publishing rights back over to the artists in 2023.\n\n\"I saw all the headlines about, 'Diddy's being benevolent and giving all of his blessed artists their publishing back.' Because it's notoriously known throughout time that he screws his artists over,\" O'Day continued.\n\nTo gain the publishing rights, O'Day had to sign a document stating that she would never speak ill of Combs or any of his associates. \"I mean, it went on for generations,\" she continued. \"It basically would cover everyone in the music industry. So, I knew at that point, he's not being benevolent; he's covering his a** for something.\"\n\nO'Day discusses the situation in TMZ's documentary, TMZ Presents: The Downfall of Diddy. \"I think you would probably be making moves to keep as many people quiet as possible,\" she said of Combs' motivations.\n\nAubrey O'Day alleged that Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs made inappropriate comments to her on Making the Band.\n\n\"I'm, right now, taking inventory of my experience,\" O'Day said on No Jumper. \" ... I'm finding out, so many times, even very early on, when Diddy was making comments like, 'Oh, now you're f***able. You look great, I could f*** you now. And things like that. I don't even remember.\"\n\nAt the time, O'Day spoke to her therapist friend about the scenario. \"She said she remembers when he said that to me. I said, 'What did I do?' She said, 'You kind of looked at me and said, 'He finally thinks I'm pretty,'\" O'Day remembered.\n\nHow to get help: In the U.S., call the RAINN National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 to connect with a trained staff member from a sexual assault service provider in your area.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_weiler@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Lauren Weiler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_the_Band", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Making the Band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_O'Day", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aubrey O'Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergroup_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supergroup (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Girl group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danity_Kane", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danity Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Records", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bad Boy Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape,_Abuse_&_Incest_National_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Sean-P.-Diddy-Combs-Aubrey-ODay-Danity-Kane.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542031", "eventUri": "eng-9542031", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The singer, who regularly clashed with Combs, said she was fired for being too \"promiscuous.\" (She rejoined in 2013.)\n\nIn a 2022 interview with the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast, O'Day revisited her dismissal, claiming that Diddy fired her because she didn't do what was \"expected\" of her: \"Not talent-wise, but in other areas.\"\n\n\"Diddy would be like, 'You're not hot anymore. Like, what happened? You don't have any curves. I can't get people to think you're my good-looking person,'\" she added.\n\nHe legally changed his middle name to Love in 2021. Two years later, he released \"The Love Album,\" his first solo studio album in 17 years.\n\nLove, he told Vanity Fair, was now his \"mission\" following the deaths of his former partner Kim Porter and mentor Harrell, the record executive, and the rise of the #MeToo movement.\n\n\"The #MeToo movement, the truth, is that it inspired me,\" Combs told the magazine.\n\nAs Combs ascended to the role of hip-hop elder statesmen, he seemed to extend an olive branch to some of the artists who felt he'd wronged them. In September 2023, Variety reported he had reassigned the publishing rights back to his artists and songwriters - a deal the publication called \"possibly unprecedented in its scale.\"\n\n\"It's just doing the right thing,\" Combs told Variety. He denied that it was a publicity stunt.\n\nJoe Poindexter, an executive at Pulse Music Group and adjunct professor at the University of Southern California, says that given the sample-heavy nature of Bad Boy's catalogue, the rights may not be worth much.\n\nWhen divvying up publishing revenue, the artist who owns the rights on the original sampled track would take a substantial portion of the pie, Poindexter says.\n\n\"It looks great as a headline,\" Poindexter said. But \"it's not making anybody rich.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Combs received a string of lifetime accolades, cementing his role as one of the genre's most defining figures.\n\nThe Grammys honored him during a pre-awards show gala in 2020, saluting Combs as an \"Industry Icon.\"\n\nHe accepted the lifetime achievement award at the BET Awards in 2022.\n\nAt the end of his acceptance speech, Combs pledged to donate $1 million to Howard University and another $1 million to Jackson State University and its football program, presenting the checks to the historically Black universities the following year.\n\nWhatever voices criticized Combs again seemed to fade into the background.\n\nTwo months before Cassie filed her explosive lawsuit, New York Mayor Eric Adams awarded Combs a key to the city.\n\nSo far, he has survived every controversy, but the events of the last six months far exceed mere \"controversy.\"\n\n\"The thing I love about Puff is that he comes back,\" Combs's assistant Norma Augenblick told the New Yorker in 2002. \"After B.I.G. died, people thought he would go right down the toilet - then he put out a No. 1 album. During the [2001] trial, Jennifer dumped him, they said his music career was over, he would be going to prison - and even if he got off he would be through.\"\n\nInstead, she noted, Combs had a happy family and a thriving business.\n\n\"Puffy will always come back,\" she added. \"He's like nature.\"", "source": {"uri": "torontosun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Toronto Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_O'Day", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aubrey O'Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Records", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bad Boy Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Her_Daddy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Call Her Daddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Girl group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_the_Band", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Making the Band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danity_Kane", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danity Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicity_stunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Publicity stunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_executive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music executive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of the City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BET_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BET Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Howard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Historically black colleges and universities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/torontosun/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sexual-misconduct-diddy-1-e1711491662636.jpg?quality=100&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542031", "eventUri": "eng-9542031", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Curry further suggested that many people may have been secretly recorded in compromising positions.\n\n\"They have 250 cameras taken from his houses,\" said the former rap artist with Combs' Bad Boy Records. \"A lot of people may be running from that tape.\"\n\nCurry isn't the only one who has attested to the rap mogul secretly recording various individuals for use as blackmail material. Music producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones made a similar claim in a lawsuit against Combs he filed in February. According to the filing, the hip-hop star reportedly stashed hidden cameras in his Holmby Hills mansion in LA and at his Star Island residence in Miami Beach.\n\n\"While living and traveling with Combs, Jones discovered that [the rap mogul] had hidden cameras in every room of his home,\" the music producer's filing stated. It also alleged that Combs regularly partied with sex workers and \"underage girls.\" These attendees were being drugged and trafficked and were required to sign nondisclosure agreements. (Related: Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has BLACKMAIL VIDEOS of influential people, former bodyguard says.)\n\nAgents from HSI, which is under the Department of Homeland Security, raided Combs' residences in March in line with a sex trafficking investigation. An attorney for the rap mogul denounced the raids, calling them a \"witch hunt\" against his client.\n\nWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

He also suggested that race was a factor for the raids, noting that such raids didn't happen to disgraced film executive Harvey Weinstein and the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTracy Walder, a former special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a former officer at the Central Intelligence Agency, also spoke in the film. She told TMZ founder Harvey Levin that the HSI agents who raided Combs' LA and Miami residences followed protocol.\n\n\"You have to remember that Diddy has been in trouble on some weapons violations in the past. There are vast compounds with multiple people [in] them, so using this type of force was not inappropriate in any way, shape or form.\"\n\nDespite this, both Walder and Levin expressed (the) belief that there had to be \"significant evidence\" against Combs for a federal judge to sign off on search warrants targeting someone so rich and powerful. For his part, the founder of Bad Boy Records has denied all of the allegations against him and has maintained his innocence. Combs himself has also denounced the raids at his homes as \"excessive.\"\n\nAubrey O'Day, former singer of the girl group Danity Kane, said in the documentary that she has been trying to warn others about Combs for years. The rap mogul signed her to Bad Boy Records when she competed in the MTV show \"Making the Band\" in 2005.\n\n\"I knew all of that was going on. I've known the whole time. I know what's gone on; a whole lot of people do,\" O'Day remarked about the accusations leveled against Combs in the form of civil lawsuits.\n\n\"I was literally text messaging producers [and] employers from top to bottom levels, like, [you all] know what the f**k you saw. People were scared,\" she continued. When asked by the TMZ founder what these people were afraid of, O'Day responded: \"Anything you possibly could think, Harvey.\"\n\nWatch this clip that explains why Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is the Jeffrey

Diddy\" Combs is in the spotlight following Homeland Security's raid on two of his properties in March 2024. After the raids, fans were reminded of his ex-girlfriend's lawsuit against him, which was settled in under 48 hours. Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura alleged that Combs was sexually violent toward her. Additionally, she added that Combs blew up Kid Cudi's car in her lawsuit. Here's what Kid Cudi said about it.\n\nSean \"P. Diddy\" Combs and his ex-girlfriend, Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura, settled out of court 48 hours after Ventura filed a lawsuit against Combs in November 2023. In the lawsuit, Ventura accused Combs of sex trafficking, human trafficking, sexual battery, sexual assault, and gender-motivated violence. According to Ventura, the abuse spanned back to 2005 when they first got to know each other. Combs signed Ventura to his label, Bad Boy Records, and the abuse allegedly worsened from there.\n\nVentura's lawsuit details the alleged abuse that she endured. And it also states that Combs blew up Kid Cudi's car. Ventura and Kid Cudi were in a brief relationship in 2011.\n\n\"Around that time, Kid Cudi's car exploded in his driveway,\" the lawsuit stated, according to Vulture.\n\nSo, what did Kid Cudi have to say about the incident? \"This is all true,\" he told a spokesperson to tell The New York Times.\n\nIn 2012, Cudi and Combs allegedly got into an altercation at Club Trousdale in Hollywood. \"The club owner didn't know that the two had beef over Cassie and decided to sit Diddy down next to Cudi,\" an insider told Bossip. \"The two then exchanged some heated words to the point where the entire club was watching, creating a huge scene.\"\n\nMaking the Band star Aubrey O'Day had a falling out with Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs through the years. While speaking to the No Jumper podcast, she explained that the incident with Kid Cudi's car made her fearful.\n\n\"If you were to believe what Cassie has alleged in her lawsuit that was settled in under 48 hours, it says that a car was blown up -- Kid Cudi's,\" O'Day explained. \"Question: If you worked for somebody that now, it's on record, that is capable of, at the very least doing that, a lot of people suggest a whole lot more. If you had firsthand conversations with bodyguards that potentially helped along with any of that, or could talk to you personally about any of that, how would you feel leaving your house?\"\n\n\"I have over 600 license plates screen capped in my phone right now from the past three months of just random cars that were parked outside my home that didn't look right to me,\" O'Day continued.\n\nRapper Boosie Badazz is a friend of Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs. During an interview with DJ Vlad, he discussed what he thinks of Combs allegedly blowing up Kid Cudi's car.\n\n\"It ain't that wild,\" Boosie said. He said he wouldn't talk about it when pressed to give more information about what he knew. The rapper also refused to confirm whether Combs participated in the illegal activity.\n\n\"You always gotta say 'allegedly,'\" Boosie added. He also noted that if Diddy had pulled off the stunt on Cudi's car, he must've been \"sick in love.\"\n\nHow to get help: In the U.S., call the RAINN National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 to connect with a trained staff member from a sexual assault service provider in your area.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_weiler@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Lauren Weiler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Cudi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kid Cudi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_O'Day", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aubrey O'Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_the_Band", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Making the Band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Records", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bad Boy Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosie_Badazz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boosie Badazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Vlad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DJ Vlad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Kid-Cudi.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542031", "eventUri": "eng-9542031", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Yes, a rabbi!\n\nAlexander Rubenstein has the story.\n\nBillionaire Zionist Lucian Grainge is the Chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group, the largest music company in the world. But since February, he and his company have also been named \" defendants\" in a lawsuit against hip-hop impresario P Diddy, whose legal name is Sean Combs.\n\nAs one of the most influential figures in one of the most popular musical genres of this century, Combs has many friends. Yet, among his closest are an outsized number of influential Zionists.\n\nCombs has been hit with five civil lawsuits in four months, while the Department of Homeland Security raided his homes in Miami and Los Angeles in late March. Said to have hundreds of cameras inside his properties, and, naturally, footage of politicians and music industry executives, Combs' role in a potential sexual blackmail operation with links to the Israel lobby bears shocking resemblance to the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy.\n\nOne of the most powerful men in music with ties to the \"Friends of the IDF\" organization has been accused of financing and attending parties held by the artist, which featured trafficked, underage sex workers. Meanwhile, A-list actor Ashton Kutcher and other entertainment industry honchos close to Combs have maintained longstanding ties to the Israel lobby.\n\nOne of the civil lawsuits was filed by Rodney Jones, a former producer hired by Combs. It accuses Diddy of sexual assault. In graphic detail, the lawsuit alleges an Epstein-style conspiracy that includes crimes ranging from the sex trafficking of minors to surreptitious druggings, sexual assault, and gun violence. According to the lawsuit, Combs' \"freak off\" parties were paid for by Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge and former Motown Records CEO Ethiopia Habtemariam in cash to avoid detection by federal authorities.\n\n\"Defendants executed their RICO Enterprise with threats of isolation from the music and entertainment industry: parading powerful music industry executives... at his parties filled with sex workers, minors, and illegal drugs, such as ecstasy, cocaine, GHB, ketamine, marijuana, and mushrooms,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\n\"Mr. Combs had hundreds of cameras in his homes in LA, NYC, and Miami. Mr. Combs required the sex workers and underaged girls to sign NDAs prior entering his parties, and prior to being drugged and sex trafficked at these parties,\" the lawsuit adds. Jones \"believes that Mr. Combs has recordings of Defendants\" - namely Grainge and Habtemariam - \"as well as other celebrities, music label executives, politicians, and athletes.\"\n\nGrainge has supported pro-Israel initiatives, such as a fund for Israeli Olympic athletes. As noted previously by Palestine Declassified, Grainge was photographed at a glitzy Friends of the IDF gala in 2016, presumably after making a hefty donation to the pro-occupation NGO. According to UK government documents, Grainge's wife, Caroline Grainge, also funds several Zionist organizations.\n\nLucian Grainge also happens to be a \"close friend\" of Haim Saban, a Democratic Party power player and mega-donor to Zionist causes like the Friends of the IDF. Saban is an independent non-executive director at Universal Music Group and last month held a fundraiser for President Joe Biden.\n\nAnother former Universal Music Group figure moonlighting as a lobbyist for Zionism is David Renzer, the former Chairman and CEO of Universal Music Publishing. Renzer founded an organization called Creative Community for Peace, an Israeli government-linked front behind the headline-making October 12, 2023 open letter from celebrities that ran cover for Israel's impending genocide in Gaza. The letter characterized criticism of the onslaught as \"an orchestrated misinformation campaign spearheaded by Iran.\" Signatories of the letter included a slew of A-list celebrities, several Universal Music Group executives, artists, and Haim Saban.\n\nAnother music industry executive with close ties to P Diddy, Clive Davis, has collaborated with Creative Community for Peace. In 1994, Davis bankrolled the 23-year-old Diddy's Bad Boy Records. Rumors in the hip-hop community of a relationship between the two - extending beyond their business dealings - have swirled around for over a decade. More recently, comments by imprisoned Death Row Records boss Suge Knight and former P Diddy bodyguard Gene Deal have thrown fuel on the fire.\n\nBoth Knight and Deal have also accused Combs of cooperation with federal authorities. Knight wrote in a since-deleted post on X, \"People the raids today wasn't for Diddy. It was to destroy the incriminating stuff on powerful men. #epstien #Diddy #clivedavis.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a recent interview, Deal claims that Combs was a confidential informant for the FBI. \"Confidential informants get paid good. But Puff [Combs] was a millionaire. Him being a confidential informant, him getting money like that - it was favors. He [sic] been getting favors, and then paying law enforcement people for years to protect him ... He had a budget for law enforcement. Now if something goes wrong, those people got friends in certain places. Then he tells his handler, 'yo, can you make this go away for me?'\"\n\nThe Rodney Jones lawsuit similarly makes references to Combs' bribes to law enforcement, accusing Combs of \"threatening to eat Plaintiff's face, displaying and distributing guns in Plaintiff's presence, bragging about having law enforcement under control, bragging about murdering people, and bragging about bribing witnesses, and jurors.\"\n\nIn charge of the bribes, according to the lawsuit, was Kristina Khorram, who is compared in the lawsuit to Ghislaine Maxwell. She and the head of security at Combs Entertainment, Faheem Muhammad, are accused of handling the bribes to law enforcement and the cash payments to sex workers.\n\nWhile Combs' ties to federal law enforcement may not amount to much more than gossip at present, his close friend for over two decades, Ashton Kutcher, has maintained a very public partnership with federal authorities. Kutcher is reportedly expecting to be subpoenaed concerning the federal investigation around Combs.\n\nUntil recently, Kutcher was the chairman and co-founder of an anti-child sex trafficking organization called Thorn, which works closely with the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies. \"I've been on FBI raids where I've seen things that no person should ever see. I've seen video content of a child that's the same age as mine being raped by an American man that was a sex tourist in Cambodia,\" Kutcher testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2017, neglecting to explain why, exactly, his role as a leader of an anti-sex trafficking operation necessitated his viewing of child pornography.\n\nIn addition to his work with Thorn, Kutcher is a prolific investor in surveillance firms. Meanwhile, his pro-CIA comments and frequent musings on geopolitics have led even a reporter at the notoriously pro-Democrat deep state outlet Mother Jones to wonder \"if Ashton Kutcher is a CIA Asset.\"\n\nKutcher stepped down from his role at Thorn in disgrace last September after his letter in support of his friend, convicted rapist Danny Masterson, sparked massive backlash.\n\nThat the former head of this anti-child trafficking organization had spent two decades partying with a figure now accused of trafficking children at his parties may make for a situation of strange bedfellows, but if the lawsuits against him are to be believed, Sean Combs is quite used to that.\n\nAsked whether he has any \"Diddy party stories\" in an interview on the Hot Ones podcast in 2019, Kutcher struggled: \"I've got a lot I can't tell. So - uhh - I can't tell that one either,\" Kutcher said, reflecting on his memories with Combs.\n\nWhile the saga of Sean Combs may still be developing, the hip hop mogul and his case's ties to some of the most influential figures in both entertainment and the Israel lobby, any news to come will surely be a far cry from music to Israel's ears.", "source": {"uri": "sonsoflibertymedia.com",

Diddy' Combs Got Awkward With Yung Miami at the 2023 Met Gala", "body": "Hip-hop mogul Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs is under watch after Homeland Security raided two of his properties in March 2024. With Combs making headlines, fans are curious about his past relationships. He was once romantically connected to Caresha Romeka Brownlee, better known as Yung Miami, and they went to the Met Gala together in 2023. Here's what happened at the event when they were questioned about their relationship.\n\nYung Miami has kept relatively quiet about her relationship with Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs, especially after the Homeland Security raid on his properties. She had on-and-off romantic involvement with Combs starting in 2022. More recently, music producer Rodney Jones Jr. named her in his lawsuit against Combs. Jones alleged that Yung Miami worked as a sex worker for Combs and brought him a mix of cocaine and ecstasy in 2023.\n\nIt's unclear how exclusive Combs and Yung Miami were during their romantic years. However, they turned heads at the 2023 Met Gala. Combs wore an all-black outfit by Sean John Couture, and Yung Miami wore a dress with a tall black tulle bust and train. She completed the look with long beads down her midsection.\n\n\"It feels great,\" Combs said when approached by Vogue at the Met Gala. \"You know, we out here giving that Black excellence.\" He then explained more about his designer look.\n\nAs for Yung Miami, she said her first time at the Met Gala felt \"like a dream come true.\"\n\nThe interviewer then asked the couple, \"Do ya'll officially go together real bad? I'm asking. I want to know.\"\n\nCombs became bashful after the question was asked. \"I don't know what you asking me, exactly,\" Combs said, attempting to redirect the question to Yung Miami. \"We definitely go together real bad. She's my date for the night. She's incredible.\"\n\n\"You know, it's just a good date night,\" Yung Miami added.\n\n\"We don't put titles on it,\" Combs said. \"Everybody wants to put a title on it. We don't put titles on it. This is, like, my best friend in the world, one of the most beautiful people God has blessed me to meet. And I'm blessed that she's my date tonight.\"\n\nMusic producer Rodney Jones Jr. filed a lawsuit with allegations against Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs. As stated previously, Yung Miami was mentioned in the lawsuit. She denied the allegations that suggested she was a sex worker for Combs who brought him drugs.\n\nA source told Us Weekly that Yung Miami has \"time-stamped photo evidence\" proving she never transported drugs to Combs. \"The allegations Lil Rod has made in his lawsuit are completely false,\" a source close to Yung Miami said.\n\nThe hip-hop artist seemingly addressed the various allegations on X. \"Y'all be going for ANYTHING,\" she tweeted on March 28, 2024.\n\nSean \"P. Diddy\" Combs reportedly didn't receive an invite to the 2024 Met Gala. While he usually would expect to receive an invitation, the serious allegations against him resulted in him getting shunned from the world of fashion and media.\n\n\"Now he finds himself grappling not only with the preservation of his reputation but also with the loss of his standing within an industry that has unequivocally distanced itself from him,\" a source told the National Enquirer, according to Radar Online.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_weiler@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Lauren Weiler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Girls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "City Girls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_Online", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radar Online"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Enquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Enquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Yung-Miami-Sean-P.-Diddy-Combs-Met-Gala.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542031", "eventUri": "eng-9542031", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Diddy's Legal Problems Continue, He Shared A Message In Cryptic Video", "body": "Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs has been embroiled in a number of legal issues as of late. For one, he's currently tied up in multiple lawsuits pertaining to sexual abuse. Additionally, he's also been investigated by the feds in relation to a human trafficking operation. Diddy himself has remained mostly quiet throughout this time. However, the music mogul just recently broke his social media silence. He did so by posting a cryptic video and, while it didn't explicitly mention his legal woes, it did include a message.\n\nThe clip in question was shared to the Grammy winner's Instagram account. It starts off with footage of a white hallway in an unknown location. The video then shifts to a shot of the Sean John founder hugging someone and then seemingly praying with a group of people. There are also shots of a beach location complete with palm trees. Viewers can eventually see the mogul standing on the sand in front of the ocean with his arms spread wide. Throughout the video, there's also narration, with the person sharing sentiments about remaining \"steady in the storm\" and more. Check it out:\n\nIt's hard to say what exactly this post is meant to convey. But, on the surface, the \"storm\" seems to reference the apparently turbulent period that P. Diddy has been going through in recent months. Also, this could simply be his way of providing an update for those who've been wondering about his whereabouts.\n\nPuff Daddy is facing suits from multiple people, one of which is from producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones. He accused the \"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down\" performer of paying to keep sex workers and, in another suit, he accused Sean Combs and his son, Justin, of covering up the shooting of a 30-year-old man at one of the artist's writers and producers camps in 2022. Aside from Jones, Liza Gardner and Joi Dickerson-Neal are also suing him. Combs has since denied the allegations, with his legal team also filing a motion to dismiss the claims from Dickerson-Neal. No formal charges have been levied against the businessman at this time.\n\nBack in late March, raids on Diddy's homes in Los Angeles and Florida were conducted by the Department of Homeland Security. Reports indicated that officials sought to obtain his personal devices, and photographs showed them leaving the locations with bags and boxes of various items. The rapper himself wasn't present at either of his houses at the time, as he'd reportedly made his way to the Caribbean beforehand. But his adult sons King and Justin were among three people who were reportedly handcuffed at the LA abode. They also reportedly had lasers pointed at them.\n\nSeveral notable individuals have weighed in on the situation since it's played out. One such person is recording artist Jason Derulo, whose career was jump-started by Sean Combs. When Derulo broke his silence after being asked about the matter, he said that he believes \"in innocent before proven guilty.\" Another reaction came from Suge Knight, who famously feuded with Combs years ago. Saying his piece, Knight opined that his peer's legal woes represented \"a bad day for the culture.\" Extra host Tanika Ray, who was a backup dancer for Combs years ago, also shared her professional experience with him. She noted that while she \"danced for\" the hip hop veteran, she \"knew to avoid him at all costs.\"\n\nTime will tell how the lawsuits against P. Diddy will proceed and what comes of the feds' investigation as well. At this point, the public can also only wait and see whether he opts to release any more mysterious content via social media in regard to the \"storm\" or other topics.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_John", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean John"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can't_Nobody_Hold_Me_Down", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suge_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suge Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Derulo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Derulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Musician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VwjZAimoqTNDZkR5vxKXZE-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542031", "eventUri": "eng-9542031", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

There's plenty of them on America's political landscape. However with the recent raid on P Diddy's home over what appears to be ties to sex trafficking, a lawsuit has also named a music executive named Lucian Grainge, a pro-Israel lobbyist. If the fact that he is a pro-Israel lobbyist doesn't garner attention, consider that Rabbi Solomon Friedman owns PornHub. Yes, a rabbi!\n\nAlexander Rubenstein has the story.\n\nBillionaire Zionist Lucian Grainge is the Chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group, the largest music company in the world. But since February, he and his company have also been named \" defendants\" in a lawsuit against hip-hop impresario P Diddy, whose legal name is Sean Combs.\n\nActivate Your Own Stem Cells & Reverse The Aging Process - Choose \"Select & Save\" OR Join, Brand Partner & Select Silver To Get Wholesale Prices Get your Vitamin B17 & Get 10% Off With Promo Code TIM How To Protect Yourself From 5G, EMF & RF Radiation Protect Your Income & Retirement Assets With Gold & Silver Grab This Bucket Of Heirloom Seeds & Get Free Shipping With Promo Code TIM Here's A Way You Can Stockpile Food For The Future Stockpile Your Ammo & Save $15 On Your First Order Preparing Also Means Detoxifying - Here's One Simple Way To Detoxify\n\nAs one of the most influential figures in one of the most popular musical genres of this century, Combs has many friends. Yet, among his closest are an outsized number of influential Zionists.\n\nCombs has been hit with five civil lawsuits in four months, while the Department of Homeland Security raided his homes in Miami and Los Angeles in late March. Said to have hundreds of cameras inside his properties, and, naturally, footage of politicians and music industry executives, Combs' role in a potential sexual blackmail operation with links to the Israel lobby bears shocking resemblance to the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy.\n\nOne of the most powerful men in music with ties to the \"Friends of the IDF\" organization has been accused of financing and attending parties held by the artist, which featured trafficked, underage sex workers. Meanwhile, A-list actor Ashton Kutcher and other entertainment industry honchos close to Combs have maintained longstanding ties to the Israel lobby.\n\nOne of the civil lawsuits was filed by Rodney Jones, a former producer hired by Combs. It accuses Diddy of sexual assault. In graphic detail, the lawsuit alleges an Epstein-style conspiracy that includes crimes ranging from the sex trafficking of minors to surreptitious druggings, sexual assault, and gun violence. According to the lawsuit, Combs' \"freak off\" parties were paid for by Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge and former Motown Records CEO Ethiopia Habtemariam in cash to avoid detection by federal authorities.\n\n\"Defendants executed their RICO Enterprise with threats of isolation from the music and entertainment industry: parading powerful music industry executives... at his parties filled with sex workers, minors, and illegal drugs, such as ecstasy, cocaine, GHB, ketamine, marijuana, and mushrooms,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\n\"Mr. Combs had hundreds of cameras in his homes in LA, NYC, and Miami. Mr. Combs required the sex workers and underaged girls to sign NDAs prior entering his parties, and prior to being drugged and sex trafficked at these parties,\" the lawsuit adds. Jones \"believes that Mr. Combs has recordings of Defendants\" - namely Grainge and Habtemariam - \"as well as other celebrities, music label executives, politicians, and athletes.\"\n\nGrainge has supported pro-Israel initiatives, such as a fund for Israeli Olympic athletes. As noted previously by Palestine Declassified, Grainge was photographed at a glitzy Friends of the IDF gala in 2016, presumably after making a hefty donation to the pro-occupation NGO. According to UK government documents, Grainge's wife, Caroline Grainge, also funds several Zionist organizations.\n\nLucian Grainge also happens to be a \"close friend\" of Haim Saban, a Democratic Party power player and mega-donor to Zionist causes like the Friends of the IDF. Saban is an independent non-executive director at Universal Music Group and last month held a fundraiser for President Joe Biden.\n\nAnother former Universal Music Group figure moonlighting as a lobbyist for Zionism is David Renzer, the former Chairman and CEO of Universal Music Publishing. Renzer founded an organization called Creative Community for Peace, an Israeli government-linked front behind the headline-making October 12, 2023 open letter from celebrities that ran cover for Israel's impending genocide in Gaza. The letter characterized criticism of the onslaught as \"an orchestrated misinformation campaign spearheaded by Iran.\" Signatories of the letter included a slew of A-list celebrities, several Universal Music Group executives, artists, and Haim Saban.\n\nAnother music industry executive with close ties to P Diddy, Clive Davis, has collaborated with Creative Community for Peace. In 1994, Davis bankrolled the 23-year-old Diddy's Bad Boy Records. Rumors in the hip-hop community of a relationship between the two - extending beyond their business dealings - have swirled around for over a decade. More recently, comments by imprisoned Death Row Records boss Suge Knight and former P Diddy bodyguard Gene Deal have thrown fuel on the fire.\n\nBoth Knight and Deal have also accused Combs of cooperation with federal authorities. Knight wrote in a since-deleted post on X, \"People the raids today wasn't for Diddy. It was to destroy the incriminating stuff on powerful men. #epstien #Diddy #clivedavis.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a recent interview, Deal claims that Combs was a confidential informant for the FBI. \"Confidential informants get paid good. But Puff [Combs] was a millionaire. Him being a confidential informant, him getting money like that - it was favors. He [sic] been getting favors, and then paying law enforcement people for years to protect him ... He had a budget for law enforcement. Now if something goes wrong, those people got friends in certain places. Then he tells his handler, 'yo, can you make this go away for me?'\"\n\nThe Rodney Jones lawsuit similarly makes references to Combs' bribes to law enforcement, accusing Combs of \"threatening to eat Plaintiff's face, displaying and distributing guns in Plaintiff's presence, bragging about having law enforcement under control, bragging about murdering people, and bragging about bribing witnesses, and jurors.\"\n\nIn charge of the bribes, according to the lawsuit, was Kristina Khorram, who is compared in the lawsuit to Ghislaine Maxwell. She and the head of security at Combs Entertainment, Faheem Muhammad, are accused of handling the bribes to law enforcement and the cash payments to sex workers.\n\nWhile Combs' ties to federal law enforcement may not amount to much more than gossip at present, his close friend for over two decades, Ashton Kutcher, has maintained a very public partnership with federal authorities. Kutcher is reportedly expecting to be subpoenaed concerning the federal investigation around Combs.\n\nUntil recently, Kutcher was the chairman and co-founder of an anti-child sex trafficking organization called Thorn, which works closely with the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies. \"I've been on FBI raids where I've seen things that no person should ever see. I've seen video content of a child that's the same age as mine being raped by an American man that was a sex tourist in Cambodia,\" Kutcher testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2017, neglecting to explain why, exactly, his role as a leader of an anti-sex trafficking operation necessitated his viewing of child pornography.\n\nIn addition to his work with Thorn, Kutcher is a prolific investor in surveillance firms. Meanwhile, his pro-CIA comments and frequent musings on geopolitics have led even a reporter at the notoriously pro-Democrat deep state outlet Mother Jones to wonder \"if Ashton Kutcher is a CIA Asset.\"\n\nKutcher stepped down from his role at Thorn in disgrace last September after his letter in support of his friend, convicted rapist Danny Masterson, sparked massive backlash.\n\nThat the former head of this anti-child trafficking organization had spent two decades partying with a figure now accused of trafficking children at his parties may make for a situation of strange bedfellows, but if the lawsuits against him are to be believed, Sean Combs is quite used to that.\n\nAsked whether he has any \"Diddy party stories\" in an interview on the Hot Ones podcast in 2019, Kutcher struggled: \"I've got a lot I can't tell. So - uhh - I can't tell that one either,\" Kutcher said, reflecting on his memories with Combs.\n\nWhile the saga of Sean Combs may still be developing, the hip hop mogul and his case's ties to some of the most influential figures in both entertainment and the Israel lobby, any news to come will surely be a far cry from music to Israel's ears.\n\nArticle posted with permission from Sons of Liberty Media\n\nTim Brown Tim Brown is a Christian and lover of liberty, a husband to his \"more precious than rubies\" wife, father of 10 \"mighty arrows\" and jack of all trades.

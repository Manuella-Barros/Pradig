The Prime Minister did not take questions from the media while touring County Durham and Yorkshire as was originally planned, with the Tories citing time constraints. He spoke with volunteers away from public view at a walled garden at Auckland Castle, Bishop Auckland, before attending a village fete in Great Ayton, a North Yorkshire village in his Richmond constituency. The opportunity to question Mr Sunak which had been expected by journalists was called off as the D-Day row continued. Labour criticised Mr Sunak for \u201cducking the cameras and dodging\u201d media questions on the campaign trail on Saturday. Shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth said: \u201cIf Rishi Sunak is going to come out with yet another desperate wish list of manifesto proposals this weekend, the least he can do is face up to proper public scrutiny over how he plans to pay for them, what the impact on people\u2019s finances will be, and when he intends to deliver on the first set of pledges he made to the British people 18 months ago. \u201cBut instead, he has spent the day ducking the cameras and dodging all those legitimate questions - just another farcical episode in this calamitous Conservative campaign. It\u2019s time to turn the page on this chaos, and vote for change with Labour on 4 July.\u201d It came after Mark Harper, the Transport Secretary, said Mr Sunak had made a \u201cmistake\u201d by skipping the D-Day event and Penny Mordaunt branded the decision \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d. Mr Sunak was forced to apologise for leaving France before an international ceremony attended by world leaders including US President Joe Biden to mark the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings. Sir Ed Davey said people were \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by the Prime Minister\u2019s decision, which was \u201csuch a letdown for our whole country and our history, particularly for our brave veterans\u201d. The Liberal Democrats leader said: \u201cI share the concerns of veterans and people across the country who feel really let down and are upset, and indeed some very angry,\u201d he told the PA news agency during a visit to Newbury. Labour\u2019s Sir Keir Starmer said it was his \u201cduty\u201d to thank veterans at the D-Day event the Prime Minister skipped.", "summary": "<![CDATA[<ul> <li><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/06/09/politics-election-campaign-latest-news/\"><strong>Follow the latest general election news</strong></a></li> </ul>]]>", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/06/08/politics-latest-news-general-election-farage-wins-debate/", "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2024/06/08/TELEMMGLPICT000380975206_17178634377460_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:01:58", "author": "Alex Barton", "authors": ["Alex Barton"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.255}

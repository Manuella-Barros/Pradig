{"id": 223688416, "title": "Kylian Mbappe confirms transfer decision will be announced imminently", "text": "Kylian Mbappe has confirmed an announcement on his future is imminent, with the forward widely expected to join Real Madrid. Mbappe announced earlier this month he would be leaving Paris Saint-Germain once his contract expires, stating: \"I wanted to announce to you all that it's my last year at Paris Saint-Germain. \"I will not extend and the adventure will come to an end in a few weeks. I will play my last game at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.\" And Mbappe has now played his final game for PSG, helping them beat Lyon 2-1 in the French Cup final. Goals from Ousmane Dembele and Fabian Ruiz saw PSG lift the trophy and Mbappe was quizzed about his future in the mixed zone after the game. \"There is a time for everything,\" he said, as per GFFN. \"I'll announce my next club in good time. We're only a few days away so there's no problem. Before the Euros? I don't know, there are still a few steps.\" He has long been linked with a move to the Bernabeu and his mother, Fayza Lamari, recently hinted that her son will be joining Real this summer. When asked who Mbappe will be joining while leaving his farewell party earlier this week, she responded: \"You all know it already.\" During his time at PSG, Mbappe has won six Ligue 1 titles and nine other domestic trophies. Reflecting on his stint with the club, he said: \"It's a lot of emotions, many years where I had the chance and the great honour to be a member of the biggest French club, one of the best in the world. \"It allowed me to arrive here, to have my first experience in a club with a lot of pressure, to grow as a player of course, by being alongside some of the best in history, some of the greatest champions. \"It's hard and I never thought it would be this difficult to announce that. But I think I needed this, a new challenge, after seven years. PSG is a club that never leaves anyone indifferent. We can love it or hate it. \"I made the choice of loving it and I did for seven years, with ups and downs of course, but I do not regret any moment since signing with this prestigious club. It's a club that I will keep in my memory my entire life.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

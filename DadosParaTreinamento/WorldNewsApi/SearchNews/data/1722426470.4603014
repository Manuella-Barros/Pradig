{"id": 243359796, "title": "Esther McCarthy: You only get 18 summers with your kids\u00a0\u2014 cherish them", "text": "\u201cEnjoy them while you can,\u201d she urged, clutching my arm. \u201cThey\u2019ll be grown in a blink, A BLINK,\u201d she cautioned. I smiled at her. \u201cOh sure, it goes so fast, I know,\u201d I said, probably a little patronisingly. She darted a look at me like I was a moron in a sundress, who really, really, didn\u2019t know. \u201cEighteen summers is all you get, and that\u2019s if you\u2019re lucky,\u201d like a gypsy\u2019s curse, she said it. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you enjoy them,\u201d I muttered darkly three minutes later when the smallie was bawling over a sore bumbum, and the older two were pelting each other with pointy shells, and I never got to finish my book. I looked around for her, wondering if I could use her nostalgia to trick her into babysitting for an hour, but she was gone. Off for a child-free nap, probably, I guessed, enviously. Eighteen years seemed like eons back then. But now, incredibly, inconceivably, my children have time warped into a 15-, a 12-, and a nine-year-old. Older, bolder, cuter, but they\u2019re still not above lobbing a stabby-looking stone at each other, given the opportunity. Looking back to that summer, it was probably the ideal age dynamic, the perfect holiday. I just didn\u2019t know it. Books read: zero. Seconds I would change about that foreign fortnight: also zero. We were in the sweet spot. No nappies, no phones, no schedules, no worries. They loved being with each other, revelled in having mam and dad\u2019s undivided attention \u2014 they wanted, nay demanded \u2014 hugs in public. They still believed mammy had magic kisses. The biggest decision was where to eat dinner, and what flavour ice-cream to choose after. The boys would spend hours just burying each other in the sand, guffawing when they finally got to put the hat on the submerged one and pretending they had disappeared. \u201cWhere\u2019s he gone?\u201d we\u2019d wonder, amazed, looking under the towels and into buckets. Playing Lego and tractors and tag and drawing in restaurants with the crappy crayons, with their little tongues peeking out the side of their mouths. That was the summer of blowing bubbles and cheating at Uno and playing musical statues in the little kitchenette of our apartment. The age gap was exquisite. They\u2019d all watch the same cartoons (Teen Titans, Spiderman, The Simpsons) back then, and listen to the same bedtime stories, all of us squashed in together, little bodies still hot from the day, and glazed with aftersun, sand in the bed, reading about Tiddler, the little fish with the big imagination. This week, son number two finished primary school. \u201cI\u2019ll never wear this uniform again,\u201d he said with a satisfied little sigh, as I hummed the \u2018Cat\u2019s in the Cradle\u2019 and tried not to ugly cry at the school gate. The 15-year-old has just landed back from 10 days away without us, and it\u2019s hitting me, hard and unexpected, that he probably won\u2019t want to come away on holidays with us soon. Grand this year, because we\u2019re not leaving the country, joke\u2019s on him, but all of a sudden, the gypsy curse is inching towards fruition. I\u2019m letting myself have a little nostalgic wallow when it dawns on me. Never mind them, how many summers do mam and dad have left? A quick Google reveals the average life expectancy is 84 for an Irish woman. Now, given that I sit on my arse for a large portion of my day, have a penchant for dining and drinking like a debauched Roman emperor, and regularly engage in life-shortening bouts of random foolishness, I am very likely to not make the average. The heavy homemade wooden clothes dryer pulley yoke fell on my head the other day, and I had to lie down on the floor and have a little faint, then when I tried to get up, I pulled a full bottle of water in an aluminum bottle down on precisely the same bit of my sore skull and I fell down again. It was a farce, and I have the bump to prove it. Men in Ireland get 80.4 years, according to the Department of Health, so between us, if my husband and I don\u2019t kill ourselves in a tragic clothes horse related incident, best case scenario, we have 33 summers left. Full stop, finito, game over. Some, we know, departed without their fair share of summers. Maybe I should book a break this year after all, we\u2019ve got to make every one count. If I\u2019m not careful, I\u2019ll blink again, they\u2019ll be 30, 27, and 24, and I\u2019ll be wearing a moomoo, leaning on my zimmerframe, and bawling over my sore bumbum. I\u2019ll dedicate my last days to cursing young mothers with the knowledge you only get 18 summers. If you\u2019re really, really lucky. Cherish them.", "summary": "\"I\u2019m letting myself have a little nostalgic wallow when it dawns on me.

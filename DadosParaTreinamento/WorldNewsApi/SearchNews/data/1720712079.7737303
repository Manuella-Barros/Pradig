Houli has been awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for service to the Islamic community, multiculturalism and Australian rules football. The 36-year-old former AFL champion used the occasion to urge the federal government to push harder for a ceasefire. \u201cThe conflict that is happening around the world, particularly in Gaza, is affecting us, mate, and this recognition for me is quite hard at this given time,\u201d said Houli, who retired from football in 2021. \u201cBut the reality is this is not about me; it is about celebrating what the community has contributed to my life and doing our best to celebrate it while there is so much bad stuff happening around the world which nobody prays for. Everyone prays for peace, everyone prays for happiness, and that\u2019s exactly what I hope for.\u201d", "summary": "The three-time Richmond premiership player says he feels conflicted about receiving the award while the Israel-Hamas war rages.", "url": "https://www.theage.com.au/national/my-heart-burns-my-blood-boils-houli-s-vow-to-speak-up-on-gaza-suffering-after-king-s-birthday-award-20240606-p5jjr7.html", "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2779945066735333%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_267%2C$y_98/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/faeb5d98c03325b6a9b1eb8de03286f8cd9b8cf0", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:00:00", "author": "Michael Gleeson", "authors": ["Michael Gleeson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": 0.311}

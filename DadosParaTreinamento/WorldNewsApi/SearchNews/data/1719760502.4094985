In October, Tricare \u2014 which insures active-duty military members and their families \u2014 changed the way it sets payments to children\u2019s hospitals, tying them to what Medicare would pay for the same services, as the insurer does for services to adults at civilian hospitals. The U.S. Department of Defense said the change would save the military up to $45 million in taxpayer funds annually, according to the Military Times. Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado estimated it has lost about $2.1 million a month since October compared to how Tricare used to pay, with the health system\u2019s Colorado Springs facilities taking a bigger hit than those in Aurora, because of the large military presence on the southern end of the Front Range. The system estimated about 16,000 kids insured by Tricare receive care at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado facilities, and about one in five children who receive care at the Colorado Springs hospital and clinics have military coverage. The $25.2 million annual loss is a relatively small percentage of Children\u2019s budget of more than $1 billion a year, but officials with the health care system say the Colorado Springs hospital could close its cancer center and make cuts in its neonatal intensive care unit and emergency department if nothing changes. Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado sued the Defense Department over the billing change in September, warning that it could lead the system to make the following cuts: Closing the Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders Closing the infusion center Treating fewer babies in the neonatal intensive care unit No longer operating a level two trauma center Making unspecified cuts to the emergency department Those cuts are still on the table if nothing changes, Children\u2019s spokeswoman Leila Roche told The Denver Post on Friday. Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado hasn\u2019t released a timeline, or specified whether it would make all the cuts at once or phase them in. The health system also hasn\u2019t said whether its larger hospital in Aurora could face cuts in the future. Children\u2019s lawsuit against the Defense Department argued the agency didn\u2019t have the authority to change its payments that way, because Medicare isn\u2019t set up for kids\u2019 health needs. Federal Judge Nina Wang ruled in favor of the department in April, finding that the change was within its rights. The change only affects certain outpatient facility charges, not reimbursement for inpatient care or professional services, such as a doctor\u2019s charges, said Peter Graves, spokesman for the Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare. By law, Tricare is required to follow Medicare rules \u201cto the extent practicable\u201d in reimbursing providers, he said. Before the change, Tricare paid the rates that hospitals billed, Graves said. Now, hospitals will receive at least enough to cover the cost of providing the care, which may be a decrease, he said. \u201cThe billed amounts generally represent multiples of the actual cost to render the care, and few insurers or private payers reimburse the billed amounts,\u201d Graves said in a statement. On May 13, the Children\u2019s Hospital Association sent a letter to leading members of the House and Senate armed services committees, asking them to work with affected hospitals on a solution. A group of organizations representing veterans and active-duty members also wrote a letter saying that the change would threaten access to care for families. \u201cThis rule therefore has the potential to risk the health of military kids, harm quality of life for those serving our nation and ultimately undermine mission readiness,\u201d the military organizations\u2019 letter said. Lawmakers haven\u2019t ordered the Department of Defense to reverse course, but did include a provision in the defense reauthorization bill to study the effects of the payment change. Not all children\u2019s hospitals are expecting a significant hit to their revenue. Both the Department of Defense and Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado said 14 facilities that treat above-average numbers of kids of military members, including Children\u2019s in Colorado, would bear the brunt of the cuts. The hospital estimated total revenue at those facilities would fall by 15% or more, while the department said only outpatient reimbursement for Tricare patients would fall that much. Children\u2019s said the high number of military facilities in the Colorado Springs area, plus a lack of other pediatric care options that accept Tricare, meant its hospital and clinics there got hit harder than many others. The Colorado Springs location lost money most years even before the change, which will cut outpatient revenue by about 40%, Roche said. \u201cIf these cuts continue, our Colorado Springs hospital will feel the largest impacts due to the proximity to the five military installations, but the ripple effect will be felt across our entire system of care,\u201d she said in a statement.

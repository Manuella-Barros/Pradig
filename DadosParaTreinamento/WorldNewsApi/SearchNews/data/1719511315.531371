Given the difficulties associated with trying to overtake on the tight Monte Carlo streets, he faced an uphill battle to try and get into the points. That battle ended on the opening lap, as P\u00e9rez was involved in a massive three-car accident with Kevin Magnussen and Nico H\u00fclkenberg that drew a red flag and caused substantial damage to all three cars. Footage of the incident led many to believe that a penalty would be coming for Magnussen, who is just two penalty points on his Super License away from a one-race ban. However, race officials quickly decided the incident did not merit further investigation, leaving the Red Bull driver incredulous. \u201cIt\u2019s lap one. I lost a position to one of the [Saubers] and obviously it\u2019s lap one, it\u2019s just important if you\u2019re not in the right position, automatically you\u2019re going to end up losing,\u201d said P\u00e9rez to F1.com after his race came to an early end. \u201cI was getting out of the corner ... on my onboard there is no point where you see Kevin and I was just pretty surprised that he kept it flat at that point, because it was just very unnecessary. We had a lot of damage, we had a very dangerous incident. It was a massive incident, and my car is completely destroyed. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed that it didn\u2019t get investigated because it was a massive incident,\u201d From his point of view, Magnussen put the blame on P\u00e9rez, making the case that the Red Bull driver left him no room along the barrier, and that he had nowhere to go. \u201cI think I was with my front alongside Perez\u2019s rear, from the exit of Turn 1 on the run up to Turn 3. He goes towards the wall, the wall comes a little bit back towards the track, and I had nowhere to go,\u201d said Magnussen to F1.com. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he didn\u2019t see me or what, but I can\u2019t just disappear out of the blue. I made contact with the wall and him at the same time, and unfortunately we had a crash. It\u2019s always frustrating. Also a crash like this is a big cost for the team, in terms of spare parts and having to make new parts \u2013 a lot of work for the guys. It\u2019s never good.\u201d You can see the collision from multiple angles here: The third driver involved in the incident, H\u00fclkenberg, truly had nowhere to go and was swept up in the collision. That vantage point may have been costly as far as his race, but gave him perhaps the best view of the initial collision. The Haas driver took a rather diplomatic stance in his own comments to F1.com. \u201cDisappointed\u2026 Gutted, to be honest,\u201d he explained to the media after his race ended.. \u201cTo be out after 500 [meters] is obviously far from ideal \u2013 also both [Haas] cars out. \u201cI got taken out by an incident that I wasn\u2019t directly involved in, but obviously it\u2019s quite narrow here, going up to Turn 3. A big shame, things were getting too tight there. I think somewhat a racing incident \u2026 It looked maybe a bit optimistic from Kevin, but I don\u2019t know, [P\u00e9rez] could have also maybe seen him and left room, so unfortunate, obviously, the outcome.\u201d Perhaps adding to the confusion was the fact that while this incident was waved off by race officials, a collision between teammates Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon on the opening lap saw Ocon penalized. Will Buxton was one of many questioning the different decisions: You can be sure we have not heard the last of it regarding these two incidents.", "url": "https://www.sbnation.com/formula-one/2024/5/26/24165143/monaco-grand-prix-sergio-perez-kevin-magnussen-nico-hulkenberg-f1", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VolsxUEEBR0sI0K0GVOJsc10xPo=/0x166:6000x3307/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25465463/2154731167.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:40:17", "author": "Mark Schofield", "authors": ["Mark Schofield"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.581}

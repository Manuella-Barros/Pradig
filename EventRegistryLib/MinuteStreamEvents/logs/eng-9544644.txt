Kevin Stitt resulted in acknowledgments that they were on the same page with a few budget allocations, but an undertone of frustration grew during talks about an income tax cut.\n\nSenate Pro Tem Greg Treat, R-Oklahoma City, House Speaker Charles McCall, R-Atoka, and their respective budget chairs met Monday afternoon with Stitt to alleviate a political impasse on the FY 2025 budget.\n\nDuring opening remarks, Stitt said his priorities were to keep expenses in line with income, get an income tax reduction agreed upon and maintain the state's historic $5 billion in savings.\n\nMcCall said his caucus wants an income tax cut and funding for sheriffs and police departments. He also mentioned maintaining the state's savings.\n\nTreat said he has concerns about $41 million for airports and funding for a teacher pay raise. He took a moment to make his expectation clear regarding transparency, which he has touted since revealing a new budget process in December.\n\n\"Subcommittees will not be cut out of this process,\" Treat said. \"They will be in charge of their own budgets.\"\n\nState Rep. Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, and House Budget Chair Kevin Wallace, R-Wellston, asked Treat if that meant negotiations made in several April meetings with subcommittee chairs would be honored, but Treat said those negotiations didn't involve all of the subcommittee members.\n\nWallace said the House has had multiple negotiations with the Senate since Senate Resolution 31, the chamber's comprehensive spending plan for FY 2025, came out. He said the \"big sticking points\" are the income tax cut, workforce development and DEQ and water resources don't have an agreement.\n\n\"Those were not negotiations between the House and the Senate,\" Treat said, explaining that he is not honoring agreements made in a manner that doesn't align with the new transparency process.\n\nThe House, Senate and Stitt were able to agree on $45 million for disaster relief matching funds to aid communities impacted by severe storms.\n\nMcCall was optimistic last week that a budget deal could be reached Monday, but that sanguinity turned into a state of exasperation on the subject of an income tax cut. He said the House is not moving on Senate positions until the tax cut is addressed by Treat's chamber and asked his counterpart to explain how a tax cut is going to work with his transparency process.\n\n\"So, it sounds like a no,\" Treat said. \"You're not going to take (an income tax) up?\"\n\nTreat said his chamber made the decision that a grocery tax cut was of the most benefit for Oklahomans.

Kevin Stitt, a handful of Democratic lawmakers and about 20 members of the Capitol press corps for a budget summit Monday that featured a prayer and a great deal of political rhetoric about tax cuts but few actual budget agreements.\n\nOne bright spot: Both chambers said they would support the governor's call for a $45 million appropriation to fund emergency management operations to clean up from a series of tornadoes that swept through the state destroying businesses and homes in Sulphur, Marietta and Holdenville.\n\nMonday's meeting, hosted by Stitt, was supposed to kick-start a state budget process that had slowed down. Last week the governor sent an email to House Speaker Charles McCall, Senate Pro Tempore Greg Treat and the Capitol press corps inviting them to a meeting on the budget. Treat replied to the governor saying he would attend. He also forwarded the email to every member of the Legislature.\n\nMonday, Stitt pushed lawmakers to come to an agreement. \"The priorities are important to keep in mind,\" Stitt said. \"Let's keep our expenses in line with our income. The second point is a tax cut. We should be able to give Oklahomans another tax cut.\"\n\nFor his part, McCall said the House was excited by \"the enhanced interest\" in being transparent. \"I think we're very close on the budget,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, Treat said the meeting was supposed to be about negotiating a budget but was, instead, \"pretty much a press conference\" on the governor's -- and the speaker's -- call for a cut in the personal income tax. Treat said he did not expect to reach a budget agreement at the meeting but did hope to \"fast track money for emergency management.\"\n\nDuring the meeting, House Appropriations Chairman Rep. Kevin Wallace also pushed Treat to cut a deal on education funding.\n\n\"We can do that, if you want to talk about a tax cut,\" Wallace said.\n\nTreat replied, \"Is this a press conference or is this the budget?\"\n\n\"It's the budget,\" Wallace said.\n\nMore: A state budget agreement could still be an uphill battle despite the special summit\n\nWhile Stitt, McCall and others met around a large conference table, Democrat members of the Senate and the House sat in the audience. Senate Minority Leader Kay Floyd and Sen. Julia Kirt said they attended the meeting to see what, if anything, would happen on the budget.\n\n\"I expect a lot of rhetoric,\" Kirt said.\n\nStill, while the meeting was overall civil, there were moments when the tension among McCall, Treat and Wallace was evident. Echoing Wallace, McCall continued to push Treat on a tax cut. McCall said the House \"was not moving\" on its budget positions until an income tax cut was addressed by the Senate.\n\nTreat's reply was terse: \"If you want to talk budget, we'll talk budget,\" he said. \"If you want to talk about revenue, we can have that conversation, too.\"\n\nWith just a few weeks left before the legislative session adjourns for the year, lawmakers have entered the crunch phase of the budget process. Monday's meeting offered few new insights into the budget but did bring all the players together in one place to talk.\n\nStitt said he was pleased by the effort. \"I think we're all working very hard,\" the governor said. \"I applaud the Senate and the House for this transparent process. I really appreciate it.\"\n\nThe 2024 legislative session will adjourn at 5 p.m. on May 31.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Treat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greg Treat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "News media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_McCall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles McCall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_A._Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry A.

But a meeting between the governor, Senate and House Monday was cut short after almost no agreements were made.\n\nSimilar to years past, it seems to be the governor and House on the same page with budget priorities, while the Senate isn't agreeing with the other two.

While Stitt and McCall were hoping to end negotiations with the meeting, Treat didn't have the same plan.\n\n\"Hopefully, I think we can get to a budget today,\" said Stitt.\n\n\"We're excited to be here to finalize this budget, I don't think we're very far apart,\" said McCall.\n\n\"We don't anticipate walking out with a budget today, So I know you suggested we may be able to do that, I don't foresee any ability to do that because of our commitment to transparency,\" said Treat.\n\nIn a continued push for transparency, Treat wasn't willing to make any final agreements in Monday's meeting, saying he wanted to run all numbers by his budget chairmen.\n\n\"I want to be abundantly clear that our subcommittees will not be cut out of this process,\" said Treat.\n\nThe Senate had a handful of appropriation subcommittee meetings scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning, ensuring the speaker and governor that he would share any new negotiations with the chairs of those committees.\n\nOn the other side of the table, Stitt and McCall are pushing tax cuts back into the conversation. Both republican leaders are calling for a quarter percent cut to the personal income tax.\n\n\"The House is not moving to Senate positions until the tax cut is addressed by your caucus,\" said McCall.\n\nAfter about two hours of conversations with almost no progress, Governor Stitt stepped in to end the meeting abruptly. Stitt invited the leaders, along with the House and Senate budget teams, to have another conversation at 2:00 pm on Thursday.\n\nSenate democrats were in the room during the budget negotiations with republican leaders, and sent a statement criticizing the \"lack of bipartisan cooperation.\"\n\n\"It's time for us to put the people of Oklahoma over politics and find real bipartisan solutions to the challenges our citizens face,\" said Floyd (D-Oklahoma City). \"We know Oklahomans are worried about our kids succeeding in school, being able to pay their bills at the end of the month, and seeing their doctor as soon as they need to. We don't believe the current budget proposals from the House or Senate include solutions to those challenges.\"\n\n\"Our children deserve the same opportunities as children in all our surrounding states, and that means additional investment,\" said Sen. Julia Kirt (D-Oklahoma City). \"A bipartisan budget would not send more public money to unregulated private schools -- it must focus on supporting students in our public schools first.

This year, lawmakers have about $13.1 billion to spend for FY 25. Monday's meeting was also rare for its open, freewheeling nature involving the governor and legislative leaders.\n\nBefore this year, state lawmakers usually held closed-door meetings on the budget, and little was known about the final package until just before it came up for a vote. Because the Legislature does almost all of the heavy lifting in writing the budget, many governors are sidelined until just before final decisions about the budget are made.\n\nThis year, however, Treat upended a number of those traditions.\n\nJust after the session started, the Republican leader announced a push for transparency that opened the budget up to more oversight, involvement and scrutiny. House leaders, following Treat's efforts, then launched an online budget portal, which illustrated the differences between House and Senate proposals. That portal, House Budget Chair Kevin Wallace said, is updated every Friday.\n\nThe push for budget transparency also has been a \"good news/bad news\" thing in the Legislature.\n\nWhat was once a quiet, closely held process has changed. Complicating the issue, in early May, Treat dismissed his long-time budget chairman, Sen. Roger Thompson, because Thompson was cutting budget deals with Wallace, his counterpart in the House, and not involving the full Senate's budget subcommittees in the process. Treat said Thompson had been pushed by House leaders to cut budget deals in order to get a final bill finished sooner.\n\nHowever, that change in leadership slowed the pace of the budget negotiations.\n\nFrustrated, Stitt emailed both Treat and House Speaker Charles McCall inviting them to a meeting on the budget. The governor's email said the meeting would be open to the public and the press.\n\nTreat replied to the governor saying he would attend and forwarded the email to every member of the Legislature.\n\nBut Stitt's agenda for the summit conference included something other than getting the budget moving. The governor was hoping -- with help from McCall and Wallace -- to push Treat toward approval of a reduction of the state's personal income tax.\n\nAnd Treat was not amused.\n\nFor months, the Senate leader has repeatedly said the Senate would not hear another tax cut bill this session. Treat said he was concerned that it would be difficult to adequately fund government and pay for a second tax cut after earlier approval of eliminating the state tax on groceries.\n\nBut Stitt, McCall and Wallace pushed ahead.\n\nMore: Lawmakers agree to $45 million for emergency management during Monday budget 'summit'\n\nStitt said the big picture from the governor's standpoint was to have no deficit spending and an income tax cut. \"I believe it's important for Oklahomans,\" the governor said. \"If we're going to spend savings. If we are going to invest in a lot of things, then we should be able to give Oklahomans a tax cut.\"\n\nWallace, the House budget chair, said he, too, wanted to talk about an income tax cut.\n\n\"An income tax cut?\" he said, directing the question at Treat.\n\nTreat continued to say no. \"We have been very clear that we cut taxes over $400 million starting with the grocery tax cut,\" Treat said. \"If you want to talk about that, it's going to take up the rest of the time. I think we need to talk about recurring revenue.\"\n\nThough Monday's meeting showed many areas where the Senate and the House were in agreement, there were several areas that underscored the divisions between the two bodies.\n\nFor example, education funding.\n\nWhile McCall said the House was \"open to any discussion on education,\" Wallace attempted to tie funding in some educational areas to an agreement on a tax cut.\n\n\"I say the same thing to you that I said to your subcommittee chair and your former chair,\" Wallace said. \"You want to put more money in education, I can get there (so) let's talk about a tax cut.\"\n\nTreat responded, asking about funding for the higher education system. \"So the Regents for Higher Education, I see we're all in agreement on the Inspire to Teach (program) at $8.5 million?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Wallace said. \"You wanna talk about a tax cut or not?\"\n\nVisibly frustrated, Treat's response was frank -- and terse. \"Is this a press conference or is this a budget negotiation?\" he said.\n\n\"It's a budget,\" Wallace answered.\n\nThe back and forth between legislative leaders continued until the group recessed the meeting -- briefly. A short time later, after the group reconvened, Treat said he welcomed members of the House to join the Senate's subcommittee meetings.\n\n\"I hear your frustration with us going back to our subcommittees,\" Treat said. \"If your members want to join our members in subcommittee in some type of joint committee process, as long as it's public, we will make sure our subcommittee chairs accommodate that.\"\n\nHouse Majority Leader Jon Echols said subcommittee members should reach out to one another to address the issues they are trying to fund. Wallace said he was frustrated \"because I feel like I'm rehashing these numbers for the third time.\"\n\nA short time later, the summit recessed for the day.

Kevin Stitt to negotiate how to spend $13 billion in the next fiscal year.\n\nTreat said on Monday he wanted to wait until Senate subcommittees met before he agreed to any budget line items with the House. He entered Thursday's meeting confident that the House would be pleased with the number of items they could agree on.\n\nBy press deadline Thursday, the talks were ongoing, but the focus was still on education funding, which is a small fraction of the entire budget.\n\nHouse Appropriations Chair Kevin Wallace, R-Wellston, and Treat agreed on making the $2.65 million to pay student teachers a recurring expense. Agreements were also reached on regents for higher education, department of libraries and workforce training.\n\nThe feasibility of an income tax cut was interjected into the conversation several times Thursday. The House and Stitt believe the state can afford an income tax cut, but Treat is worried about recurring revenue. Stitt clarified that he was no longer suggesting a .25% tax cut, but a flattening of the bracket and raising of standard deduction.\n\nWallace said flattening the bracket for a full year would have a $321 million impact.\n\nTreat expressed confusion due to the House's use of LOFT estimates instead of the Oklahoma Tax Commission.\n\nStitt said flattening the rates would be highly beneficial to Oklahomans suffering from the effects of inflation.\n\n\"We're talking about all the spending and all this thing we're doing and we're not talking about slowing the growth of government,\" Stitt said. \"If we're good, if we've got enough money to spend $1.5 billion in savings, surely we have enough money for a $300 million flattening of the tax rate for the poorest of Oklahomans.\"\n\nMcCall said the state has never lost revenue because of tax cuts.\n\n\"We're having a conversation about doing the best that we can as a state for the people in the state of Oklahoma and all that they're being challenged on individually and those in our state with the lowest incomes are the ones that are having the toughest problem dealing with inflation,\" McCall said.\n\nPart three of Budget Summit 2024 is expected to take place next week.", "source": {"uri": "journalrecord.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Journal Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_elkins@journalrecord.com", "name": "Jeff Elkins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Treat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greg Treat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_McCall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles McCall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_tempore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro tempore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Tax_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma Tax Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_cut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax cut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard deduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://journalrecord.com/files/2024/05/je-budget-page-1-1-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544644", "eventUri": "eng-9544644", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Kevin Stitt found humor only once as they passed around color-coded spreadsheet packets and leafed through their pages.\n\n\"Do you have to have some kind of special glasses to read this?\" Senate President Pro Tempore Greg Treat (R-OKC) asked House Appropriations and Budget Committee Chairman Kevin Wallace (R-Wellston).\n\nThe nine elected officials seated around the table laughed, and for a few moments it seemed like placards, platitudes and pleasantries might define a day supposedly dedicated to charting a course forward for the final month of session.\n\nBut 20 minutes later, six years of built-up barbs began to fly between chamber leaders as they conducted a postmortem of ousted Senate Appropriations and Budget Committee Chairman Roger Thompson and bickered over dozens of \"deals\" Senate subcommittee chairmen had cut -- apparently improperly -- with their House counterparts.\n\n\"So those members of the Senate that conveyed to our leadership that they were authorized and had the ability to negotiate on Monday, I guess they did not and they lied to our team?\" asked House Speaker Charles McCall (R-Atoka). \"Or what's the situation there?\"\n\nTreat said he was not in those meetings with Sen. Adam Pugh (R-Edmond) and Sen. Brent Howard (R-Altus) -- the budget subcommittee chairmen for education and public safety, respectively -- and did not know \"what was said.\"\n\n\"You're not going to hear me allow members of the Senate to be called liars,\" Treat said. \"We wanted to have a public forum, and this is the public forum we are in.\"\n\nIndeed, Treat had praised the concept of Monday's open meeting as a further step toward the \"transformative\" transparency he has sought since last fall. But his sudden removal of Thompson (R-Okemah) left the Senate side of the table somewhat outgunned during Monday's two-hour meeting, which featured political pot shots, methodical review of education agency appropriation positions, and confusion over how or when anyone is supposed to know what the Senate will or will not agree to.\n\nRELATED\n\nAfter sacking Thompson, Treat replies to Stitt email by looping entire Legislature by Tres Savage\n\nWith Thompson out of the picture and new Chairman Chuck Hall (R-Perry) saying he felt like he had been in his role for \"five minutes,\" Treat largely led the line-by-line review of education items, saying the Senate subcommittee -- not its chairman -- would make negotiation decisions during a Tuesday meeting.\n\n\"What I said is that subcommittees have been empowered,\" Treat told his House counterparts. \"What you heard was that subcommittee chairs have been empowered.\"\n\nDuring the review of education position differences -- which had been publicly visible and the subject of negotiations for weeks -- Treat sometimes appeared unsure of the numbers presented on the House spreadsheet. With Senate Floor Leader Greg McCortney (R-Ada) and new Senate Appropriations and Budget Committee Vice Chairman Paul Rosino (R-OKC) barely speaking, the process of explaining to Treat what Thompson would already have known appeared to irk some House members.\n\n\"I could recite these numbers from my mind and tell you the six or so areas where we disagree,\" Wallace said after the education review concluded and the gathered government officials took a break. \"I really don't like renegotiating agreements.\"\n\nWhen members reconvened and the livestream resumed around 4 p.m., it became clear all parties wanted a way to end Monday's matinee.\n\nHouse Speaker-designee Kyle Hilbert (R-Bristow) suggested focusing on key areas of difference between the chambers. Treat countered by proposing joint House-Senate subcommittee hearings. Stitt reiterated his talking points of limited government, lower taxes and strong savings, which somehow lightened a mood darkened by the repeated utterance of the word \"subcommittee.\"\n\nIn the end, the three legs of the proverbial state budget stool agreed to reconvene for further discussions at 2 p.m. Thursday, a meeting that many onlookers quickly assumed would be cancelled owing to the general futility of what had just transpired.\n\n\"I'm glad we had the meeting to get everybody talking. I think we made progress, even though it didn't feel like it,\" Stitt said after Monday's meeting adjourned. \"I think the Senate is going to go back now and at least know where everybody is, and then we can start the negotiation.\"\n\nBut speaking after the meeting also, McCall and Wallace expressed frustration about the fact that negotiations had already occurred, meaning some of the House numbers Treat read aloud Monday reflected aggregate adjustments.\n\n\"We went into this meeting today thinking there were maybe four or five areas of the budget that needed to get fine-tuned for a budget deal, but that was not the position of the Senate,\" McCall said. \"We tried to ascertain today and ask very specific questions about how things would flow from their process -- which has not been disclosed or discussed beyond the first seven weeks of session since their Senate resolution came out.\n\n\"It appeared to me that there is no consistency in their answers from issue to issue. They said they would be taking up votes on some things. They would not agree to take up votes on all things. Therefore, I don't think their process is as transparent as they believe it is.\"\n\nTreat argued otherwise during Monday's meeting, and afterward he stood firm on the importance of the new Senate's subcommittee process.\n\n\"Perhaps a top-down dictate works in the House, but that's not how the Senate operates. My caucus -- and frankly the entire state -- deserves better,\" Treat said. \"I am committed to an open and transparent process that includes all members. If the speaker can't understand that, that's his problem not mine.\"\n\nMcCall said he finds the Senate's third round of meetings with agency directors \"perplexing.\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem like the process is productive,\" McCall said. \"I want to be respectful of their process, but now the Senate is using their own process to not be able to resolve an issue. Pro Tem Treat said he is in charge, yet he said he wasn't in charge today. He said he would have to take everything back to his caucus to run through committees.\"\n\nMcCortney, also speaking after the meeting, expressed frustration that the House did not accept Treat's offer for joint subcommittee hearings on appropriation questions.\n\n\"It was sad to me that they would not agree to allow their members to meet with our members in a public forum and go over these numbers,\" McCortney said. \"That would have been the best way to get over the hump that we find ourselves on. (...) I think we would have a budget really fast.\"\n\nHouse members believed they were close to having a \"really fast\" budget merely one week ago, but the subsequent seven days led to Monday's public budget meeting. Following Thompson's removal, Stitt emailed McCall and Treat to propose the public meeting, and Treat replied by looping the entire Legislature to announce his acceptance of the invitation.\n\nWhen they finally found themselves around the same table, Treat thanked Stitt for calling the chambers together for public dialogue, and he ruminated on the virtues of the House's online budget portal, which has been updated on Fridays following each week's discussions.\n\n\"We didn't spend money creating a portal, but I applaud you for it. I'm kind of jealous about it,\" Treat said.\n\nHouse leaders, however, repeatedly attempted to press Treat on the concept of an income tax rate reduction, a proposal supported by Stitt that carries a roughly $250 million annualized price tag. But while House leaders needled their counterparts over whether the Senate would put it up for a vote, Treat emphasized that the House sent the Senate a slate of tax-cut options and that the Senate had already chosen to eliminate the state portion of sales tax on groceries.\n\n\"We're not interested in a CPAC score, we're not interested in the next election, we're interested in making sure that we set a very prudent course for the state of Oklahoma moving forward,\" Treat said.\n\nAs the assemblage of elected officials prepared to adjourn Monday's meeting, Hilbert suddenly asked Treat about the Senate leader's statement last week that \"pet projects\" had snuck into budget negotiations from the House's side of the ledger.\n\nTreat pointed to a $41 million appropriation proposed to the Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics for \"airport economic development projects.\"\n\n\"There are several prominent projects in Lincoln County, there are projects in Atoka, there are projects in Stroud, there are projects in Okemah that came out last week,\" Treat said. \"There's 108 airports, and the fact that three of the top nine ended up with top legislators I find very coincidental.\"\n\nHouse Majority Floor Leader Jon Echols (R-OKC) took umbrage at the comment.\n\n\"I think it's a big accusation that a director was somehow manipulated or something had happened to them, so I would be very curious what the director says,\" Echols said.\n\nAfter Monday's meeting, McCall responded to Treat's curiosity by noting that aerospace is Oklahoma's second-largest industry and that a slate of airport projects has been funded over the last decade.\n\n\"This Atoka project they're talking about has been on the books for 19 years. I think if it were a pet project for me, I would have talked about it some other time besides the last year that I'm here,\" McCall said. \"It's highly offensive that anybody would discount the people of my House district and try to use me or my position or make an accusation of something I haven't done to demean them, belittle them or render them unimportant.\"\n\nSeated to the side in McCall's office while the speaker signed a stack of proclamations thicker than the Legislature's budget spreadsheets, Wallace turned the topic to a half-funded and controversially proposed Department of Public Safety training center that Treat hinted at early in the day's meeting. Wallace's district covers Lincoln County.\n\n\"They brought up Lincoln County projects. They're talking about the DPS (training center). That was vetted and approved last year through the [Legacy Capital Fund], phase one. Phase two is coming,\" Wallace said. \"But what I'm hearing is senators saying, 'Hey, I don't like where these projects are going even though they're good for the state of Oklahoma, so I am going to disapprove them.' And they are executive agency asks. I have no implementation on anything about it, but we did agree as a body last year to fund phase one of it. On phase two, the floor leader over in the Senate would not hear the bill that the senator had -- Sen. Thompson -- for phase two. So really, the problem is in that Senate area over there.\"\n\nEarlier this year, McCortney had declined to hear Thompson's proposal to fund the remainder of the DPS project. Late Monday, McCortney elaborated on the dynamics of the issue by referencing the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training, which is based in Pontotoc County, which he represents.\n\n\"There may be concerns about the location,\" McCortney said after a long pause. \"It's interesting where it ended up. I know that some people have raised that. I think that there are a lot of concerns about the project. There are a lot of people opposed to the project itself, so I don't think this is some personality-based thing. I think there are a lot of people opposed for some pretty legitimate reasons, I believe.\n\n\"(On) phase two, maybe some people feel like there's a little bait and switch, if you will. If DPS needed -- whatever it is, $160 million -- they probably should have asked for that up front instead of trying to get half of it and then pretending like we have to do the second half because we did the first half when we never knew there was going to be a second ask.\"\n\nMcCortney said the issue involves a lengthy \"history lesson\" that has made the matter contentious for years.\n\n\"It goes back to CLEET. Originally, DPS was supposed to be part of CLEET,\" McCortney said. \"They refused to do that, and that's caused financial problems for CLEET, it's caused financial problems for every sheriff's department and every police department in the state because they refused to be a part of CLEET after it was created and after they had agreed to be a part of it, and now they want to build a facility that looks exactly like CLEET for themselves, and I just think a lot of people don't think the state needs two of those.\n\n\"I think we've got one, and I think DPS could use it. If we need to build another dorm, we could do that and it would cost a lot less than the $150 million or $160 million that they're asking for.\"\n\nOther items of budgetary disagreement between the chambers include a pair of large-sum designations of one-time dollars sought by the House and viewed cautiously by the Senate:\n\nAmid all of the day's drama, the only budget item agreed to Monday by legislative leaders and Stitt was a $45 million commitment for the state's portion of emergency aid to the Department of Emergency Management as response to recent tornado and storm damage.", "source": {"uri": "nondoc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NonDoc"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tres_savage@nondoc.com", "name": "Tres Savage", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Treat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greg Treat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Budget", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Budget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_A._Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Henry A.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Chuck Hall, R-Perry, is on the left. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY - Gov. Kevin Stitt and legislative leaders on Thursday met for a second day of public budget negotiations where tax cuts figured in prominently.\n\nHouse leaders and Stitt floated the idea of flattening the state's tax brackets to benefit those earning $27,100 or less who would pay nothing.\n\nThey also proposed tying an additional .25% drop in the top tax bracket, which is 4.75%, to revenue growth and creating a path to elimination.\n\nSenate President Pro Tem Greg Treat, R-Oklahoma City, and his caucus have been opposed to additional income tax cuts after agreeing earlier this session to eliminate the state's sales tax on groceries. That cut is expected to reduce state revenue by about $418 million a year.\n\nTreat asked what the House was willing to cut in ongoing expenses to fund an additional tax cut.\n\nTreat said the Senate wants the state to have $1 billion in unobligated cash in addition to the contents of the state's Rainy Day and Revenue Stabilization funds, the state's savings accounts.\n\nHouse Appropriations and Budget Chairman\n\nKevin Wallace, R-Wellston, said the state will have a large cash reserve at the end of fiscal year 2024.\n\nLawmakers and staff passed around spreadsheets and haggled over the interpretation of figures and prior commitments.\n\nThe first two and a half hours of discussions appeared to be less strained than Monday's meeting, where lawmakers traded barbs on who backed out of certain agreements and whether the process was being used as a press conference on tax cuts.\n\nLawmakers on Thursday joked and laughed throughout the process.\n\nBoth sides repeatedly said they were agreeing on more and more funding issues, but differences remained, such as funding a $2,500 stipend for public school support staff.\n\nHouse Speaker Charles McCall, R-Atoka, said lawmakers last year gave education $700 million more which local districts could have used to fund the stipends. McCall said the price tag to the state for the stipends was $99 million.\n\nWallace said Senate Education Chairman Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, wanted the state to fund the stipends even though it was not an agency request.\n\nEarlier in the day, Treat met with reporters as he normally does at the end of the week.\n\nHe was asked about the upcoming budget meeting.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Treat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greg Treat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_bracket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tax bracket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President of the Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_tempore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pro tempore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Hall_(Oklahoma_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Hall (Oklahoma politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Appropriations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Appropriations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Wallace_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Wallace (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Pugh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Pugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_McCall", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles McCall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/oklahoma_voice_articles_544/33f2d2f7bf831772a3dc016d36ad527c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544644", "eventUri": "eng-9544644", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

As lawmakers discuss the line-item minutiae in their subcommittees and the big-picture priorities alongside the governor, disagreements remain on a handful of key issues and the end of session draws near.\n\nSenate Pro Tem Greg Treat laid out a few expectations ahead of Monday's historic state budget summit with House Speaker Charles McCall, Governor Kevin Stitt and other House and Senate leaders. But one stood out:\n\n\"I want to be abundantly clear that our subcommittees will not be cut out of this process,\" Treat said. \"Our subcommittees will be back in control of their own budgets. We will take back what we learned today to those subcommittees.\"\n\nLegislative subcommittees are teams of lawmakers nailing down the nitty-gritty details of state spending during public meetings. They make budget proposals based on input from state agency heads and statutory requirements.\n\nTreat insists each area of disagreement is discussed in its corresponding public forum, rather than behind closed doors, as is typically done to expedite budget making. \"Any agreements that were made behind closed doors were not agreements,\" Treat said.\n\nBut his commitment to what he calls a more transparent process means little progress on actual budgetary agreements, as Senate subcommittee members stuck to their original positions on most key issues following their May 7 meetings.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from Senate subcommittee discussions Tuesday, starting with one appropriation both chambers agree on:\n\nThe general government budget subcommittee pushed $41 Million for the Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics to the Senate's main Appropriations and Budget Committee. The amount meets the agency's request and is meant to jumpstart airport infrastructure upgrades across rural Oklahoma. According to the House's Budget Transparency Portal, the Senate and the House are aligned here.\n\nGrayson Ardies, executive director of the state's aerospace department, told subcommittee members his agency thoroughly reviewed Oklahoma's 108 airports between 2019 and 2022 and identified a need for robust upgrades - particularly in rural towns - if airports are to remain safe, accessible and qualified for continued state and federal funding.\n\n\"A lot of our airports trace their history back to World War II or shortly thereafter,\" Ardies said. \"We need to be able to do better to ensure for the next 20 years that the transportation network is going to be doing what it's supposed to.\"\n\nWithin the $41 million are eight rural projects and one in Oklahoma City, each with a dollar amount between $4 million and $6.5 million. They include everything from an airport relocation in Atoka to redesigning runways in Watonga and Pawhuska and building larger hangars for certain airplanes in Oklahoma City.\n\nArdies said the proposed projects would be transformational for Oklahoma's small towns.\n\n\"These are something that people would look back on 15, 20, 30, 40 years from now and go, 'man, I remember that time in 2024 when this happened,'\" he said. \"If we went and spent $41 million at Tulsa International or Will Rogers World Airport, chances are five years from now, no one would recognize it.\"\n\nWhen concerns about costs to maintain the new infrastructure arose among lawmakers, Ardies said it would pay for itself over time. The new airports and runways will also come with more industry-related businesses and tourism.\n\nLawmakers in the two chambers are about $130 million apart on common and higher education funding.\n\nSenate leaders want to pay for public school support staff stipends, bonuses for psychologists, speech pathologists and audiologists and relief for career tech waiting lists across the state.\n\nBoth chambers want to pay for the state education department's maternity leave revolving fund, grant money appropriations for the Arts Council and upgrades for the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority.\n\nSen. Adam Pugh chairs his chamber's education budget subcommittee. One thing he wanted to make clear to fellow members is his commitment to Treat's transparency process. He said verbal agreements, even ones at the ongoing budget summits, don't matter unless they are also agreed on in subcommittees.\n\n\"It starts or stops in the subcommittee,\" Pugh said. \"So what they said does not matter if the subcommittee hasn't agreed to it. And that's our process.\"\n\nThe House and Senate are aligned on most Department of Public Safety appropriations, including an injection for a new Oklahoma State Highway Patrol training center. The exception, according to the portal, is the $8.3 million the Senate wants to give the Department of Corrections via Senate Bill 142, which would relaunch the prison rodeo in McAlester.The Senate is vying to appropriate millions for recruitment and retention efforts within the District Attorney's Council and pay raises and IT infrastructure improvements across courts and judicial agencies.\n\nHouse Speaker McCall said he agrees with ensuring proper funding of law enforcement and courts but expressed hesitancy to go along with pay raises for government officials without an income tax cut.\n\n\"The people of the State of Oklahoma need to get a pay raise too, through a tax cut,\" McCall said. \"The House budget will allow for a quarter percent cut. I don't think that's too much to ask.\"\n\nLawmakers have until May 31 to pass a state budget and conclude the legislative session.", "source": {"uri": "kgou.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGOU

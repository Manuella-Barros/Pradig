Wes Moore and Attorney General Anthony Brown discussed the launch of an online system Monday for sexual assault survivors to anonymously track their DNA evidence test kits as they progress through the criminal justice system.\n\nUsing a barcode system, survivors of sexual assault will be able to keep tabs on their evidence kits as they move from the hospital, to the police department, to a crime lab and so on. Survivors will be given a unique tracking number and password after their evidence kit is completed at a hospital. Everyone who comes into contact with the kit is to scan the barcode when its in their custody, so that survivors can look up its exact location at any given time.\n\n\"When survivors don't feel the system is on their side, survivors won't come forward and justice won't be served. And that's hurting all of us,\" Moore, a Democrat, said at a news conference in Annapolis on Thursday morning. \"But when people feel there's accountability, we have a better chance of getting evidence, and a better chance of closing cases, and a better chance of serving justice.\"\n\nAfter someone reports to law enforcement that they have been sexually assaulted, oftentimes they will undergo a forensic exam at a hospital to collect DNA evidence to confirm or identify their attacker. The evidence is then preserved so that it can be used during a criminal trial.\n\n\"This kit is a promise of justice,\" Brown, a Democrat, said. \"However, for too many victims and survivors in too many communities -- not only here in Maryland, but across the country -- when kits left hospital rooms, victims were left with nothing but questions: 'Where's my evidence kit? When does justice come?'\"\n\nThe program, known as Track Kit, is already in place. Legislation passed in 2023 mandates that all evidence kits in the state's backlog be added to the system by Dec. 31, 2025.\n\nBaltimore County State's Attorney Scott Shellenberger, a Democrat, said the tracking system will aid his office in identifying witnesses to introduce DNA evidence, and allow prosecutors to ensure that kits are actually being tested.\n\nShellenberger is in his fifth term as the county's top prosecutor. His office and the Baltimore County Police Department came under fire in 2019, when county officials said that both agencies needed to do a better job of investigating and prosecuting sexual assault cases.\n\nOnline tracking systems already exist in states across the country, including North Carolina, Ohio and Oklahoma. But Maryland is the only state to track all existing evidence kits, including those that were collected before its system was created.\n\nAccording to the governor, Maryland had 5,000 untested evidence kits in 2022.\n\nLisae Jordan from the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault said that survivors who need assistance using the tracking system can contact her organization at (833) 364-0046, or can reach out to their local rape crisis center.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, Brown said 14 survivors have logged into the system a combined total of 90 times.\n\n\"What does that tell you?\" he asked. \"Survivors want action.\"\n\nAngela Wharton is a prime example.\n\nIn 1996, Wharton, a mother of two girls, was raped at gunpoint in a wooded area in Northeast Baltimore. She underwent a forensic exam, which she said was \"invasive and humiliating.\"\n\n\"It was a grueling ordeal, where my body was a literal crime scene,\" Wharton said Thursday. She said she endured the exam in the hope that the person who attacked her would be held accountable for his actions.\n\nThat day never came.\n\nIn 2018, she discovered that all of the evidence in her case, including her untested evidence kit, had been destroyed by the local police department less than two years after she was assaulted. Wharton said that the tracking system \"represents a ray of light\" for survivors who often have their \"trauma dismissed and their pursuit of justice thwarted.\"\n\n\"I vow to continue to use my voice to advocate for change, to raise awareness, and to support efforts that give other survivors a greater chance at justice,\" Wharton said. \"I want my daughters to grow up in a world where their voices are heard, their bodies are respected, and their rights are upheld.\"\n\nLawmakers have worked for years to bring more transparency to survivors of sexual assault.\n\nSen. Shelly Hettleman, a Democrat from Baltimore County, who has championed the issue throughout her legislative tenure, said she was inspired to act after reading an article in The Baltimore Sun about a young woman who alleged she was vaginally penetrated by a beer bottle after going out for drinks with a coworker. She said that Baltimore County Police didn't take her seriously, and found out three years after she was assaulted that her evidence kit and the beer bottle she gave to law enforcement had been thrown away.\n\n\"And so began my journey building on the work of so many who came before me,\" Hettleman said.\n\nMoore said that the new system will hold law enforcement accountable to send sexual assault evidence kits to crime labs for testing rather than having them go unprocessed in evidence lockers.\n\nIn 2017, Hettleman successfully sponsored legislation that standardized the method in which sexual assault evidence kits are preserved. The bill also had a provision mandating evidence kits be held for 20 years before they are thrown away. That was later changed to 75 years.\n\nIn 2018, the General Assembly passed legislation that required the Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention to apply for federal funding to create a sexual assault evidence kit tracking system.\n\nMaryland has received $5 million from the federal government for kit testing and the tracking system.\n\nDuring the 2023 legislative session, Hettleman and House Judiciary Committee Vice Chair Sandy Bartlett sponsored a bill to regulate reporting requirements for the tracking system.\n\n\"It wasn't good enough to build it,\" said Hettleman. \"We actually have to hold stakeholders accountable for interacting with it.\"\n\n\"Survivors deserve justice and they deserve peace,\" she continued. \"I hope this tracking system will allow them to have both.\"", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_gaskill@baltimoresun.com", "name": "Hannah Gaskill", "type": "author",

Two decades later, she was left devastated and revictimized, spiraling into a deep depression after learning that police officers had destroyed evidence in her case, including her untested rape kit, shortly after she was raped in a wooded area of northeast Baltimore.\n\nWharton, her fellow advocates for sexual assault survivors and state officials hope that a new online tracking system for evidence kits will prevent similar cases of negligence from law enforcement and help clear a backlog that has deprived victims of answers.\n\nDespite legislation and committee recommendations in 2017 and 2018 meant to improve resources for survivors and require the state to apply for federal funding for a tracking program, it's taken years for the government to compile an inventory of kits in its possession, overcome pandemic-era delays and stand up the new system.\n\nWharton said the program, administered through the Governor's Office of Crime Prevention and Policy, \"represents a ray of hope for survivors like me who have endured the anguish of having their trauma dismissed and their pursuit of justice thwarted.\"\n\nIn the Track-Kit program, which the state launched weeks ago and for which it contracted in 2023 with InVita Healthcare Technologies, which has offices in Baltimore and Los Angeles, each kit has a barcode that agencies members will scan when they assume custody.\n\nThe state in the coming months is expected to add the barcodes to all kits currently in the hands of law enforcement agencies, including those being housed in police storage units and crime labs.\n\nSen. Shelly Hettleman, a Baltimore County Democrat who for years has pushed for such reforms, said lawmakers have required barcodes for all kits to be uploaded by the end of 2025. The state is expected to cover the InVita contract and launch the system with more than $5 million in federal grants from recent years.\n\nAfter completing a forensic exam at a hospital, sexual assault victims should now receive a barcode number and password for tracking their evidence.\n\nKits logged in the system won't be open to the public, though Lisae Jordan, executive director and counsel at the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault, said she's anticipating that rape crisis centers, child advocacy centers, sexual assault advocates and attorneys will also eventually have access to specific evidence.\n\nJordan said that some victims may be uncomfortable seeking answers from the very government agencies that have left them in the dark, and that advocates and attorneys can use information from the new program to help survivors navigate the tracking system, enforce victims' rights and ensure the state \"never again has a backlog\" of untested kits.\n\n\"Survivors who choose to have a forensic exam to provide the state with vital information that we need to convict sex offenders and make our communities safer, they should be lifted up as heroes,\" Jordan said during Thursday's event. \"Tracking the evidence that they have provided from their bodies after the trauma of a sexual assault -- that's the least we can do.\"\n\nThe new system will be a tool for survivors, though they will still need advocates and victims' rights attorneys to guide them through the legal process and connect them with crisis centers for counseling and support, Jordan said.\n\nScott Shellenberger, the Democratic state's attorney for Baltimore County, said the new system enabled him to identify the nurse who conducted forensic exams in a sexual assault case his office is overseeing, giving his team its first potential witness for introducing the DNA evidence.\n\nA later check into the system revealed that the kits were in the Baltimore County Police Department's property room and pointed out the identity of the officer who picked them up from the hospital.\n\n\"When I click on that the next time -- in 30 days, 60 days -- I better see that it's not sitting in property evidence,\" Shellenberger said. \"I better see that it's somewhere else, being tested.\n\nSexual assaults and rapes are the most unreported crimes in Maryland, Gov. Wes Moore said Thursday. In 2022, there was a backlog of 5,000 kits.\n\n\"When survivors don't feel like the system is on their side, these survivors won't come forward and justice won't be served. And that's hurting all of us,\" Moore said.\n\nThe governor and Attorney General Anthony Brown, a fellow Democrat, framed the system as a way to strengthen people's trust in law enforcement agencies.

(AP) -- For Angela Wharton, Maryland's new statewide tracking system for sexual assault evidence represents a ray of hope, enabling survivors to monitor the data online.\n\nWharton was raped in 1996 and described the trauma she experienced more than 20 years later, when she was informed all the evidence, including her untested kit, had been destroyed by local authorities.\n\nWhat could have brought her assailant to justice, she said, had been \"callously discarded less than two years after the rape, leaving me feeling betrayed, violated and utterly powerless.\"\n\nOn Thursday, standing with Gov. Wes Moore and Attorney General Anthony Brown, she praised the completion of a new online system that will let victims anonymously keep track of the evidence.\n\n\"With this new tracking system, survivors are no longer left in the dark wondering about the fate of their rape kits or the progress of their cases,\" Wharton said. \"Transparency and accountability are now within reach, offering a glimmer of hope to those of us who have long been denied a voice and a chance to seek justice.\"\n\nThe system is now up and running in the state. As of Thursday, 14 people already had logged into the system 90 times, Brown said.\n\n\"What does it tell you? Survivors want action,\" Brown said. \"They expect all of us to do our jobs. The tracking program is going to give survivors the transparency, accountability, dignity, and support they deserve. \"\n\nThrough the new system, called Track-Kit, unique bar codes will be added to all sexual assault evidence kits collected in the state. Once a forensic exam is completed at a hospital, the victim will be given a bar code number and password. Law enforcement will scan the bar code when they assume custody of the kit.\n\nIn the coming months, bar codes also will be applied to all existing kits, including those maintained in police storage units or crime labs.\n\n\"For survivors, that means you can go into the tracking system 24/7, 365 days a year, armed with your bar code number and password and track the progress of your kit, from the hospital, through law enforcement, to the lab for testing then back to the appropriate agency,\" Brown said.\n\nBrown said the state contracted with InVita Technologies to create the system, which the company says is used by 15 other states.\n\nMoore said the new online system will help build trust \"between our communities and the forces that are sworn to protect, and today we will make Maryland safer by strengthening that trust.\"\n\n\"Then we can start building towards a culture of teamwork and transparency and trust, and this kind of tracking system has already been stood up in red states and in blue states, from North Carolina to Ohio to Oklahoma, and now it's Maryland's time to get this done,\" Moore said.\n\nState Sen. Shelly Hettleman said a measure approved last year that sets out the requirements of the tracking system requires information from kits to be entered into the new system by December of next year.\n\nMaryland has been working on a backlog of untested rape kits. In 2022, the state had a backlog of 5,000 untested sexual assault evidence kits.\n\nCarisa Hatfield, assistant attorney general and counsel for the Maryland Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Policy and Funding Committee, said the state is working on addressing the backlog.\n\n\"We have both state and federal funding to clear that backlog,\" Hatfield said. \"I unfortunately can't give you an exact day, time, when that will occur, but it is an ongoing process that we are working on expeditiously,\" Hatfield said.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcode"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Brown_(Maryland_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Brown (Maryland politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wes Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annapolis, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Annapolis, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_kit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape kit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelly_L._Hettleman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shelly L.

He said Damion was a clumsy tot and had collided with a coffee table while playing with his toys in the living room.\n\nBut the jury saw through his lies after hearing how Hardcastle spent the nights before Damion died drinking and chatting to women on social media. He left Damion alone in the flat to visit local shops to buy more alcohol.\n\nWhen emergency services arrived at the flat on August 19, they were met by Hardcastle, who was bare chested and had blood on his face. He had called 999 and was attempting CPR.\n\nDamion's blood soaked clothing was found in the kitchen bin and Hardcastle was attempting to clean Damion's faeces from the sofa.

Hardcastle was convicted of murder after a jury at Preston Crown Court heard harrowing details of catastrophic injuries he inflicted on his son on the morning of August 19, 2023. Emergency services were called to the flat in Central Drive, to find Damion covered in bruises and in a state of cardiac and respiratory arrest.\n\nDamion was placed in the care of his father following a 12 month assessment period. The little boy had been removed from his mother at 10 months old and placed with foster parents, but following a DNA test which confirmed he was the father, Hardcastle applied for custody.\n\nREAD MORE: 5 Maghull men on trial accused of plotting street fight in which teenager Matthew Daulby was killed\n\nThe pair moved to a flat in Central Drive, Blackpool, with support from family members, social workers and a mental health charity Dad Matters. Damion was allocated a nursery place and there was a playgroup across the road. However in the weeks before Damion died, Hardcastle's mum was taken into hospital and the father began drinking. On several occasions he visited local shops to buy alcohol, leaving his son alone in the flat.\n\nOn August 19, 2023, Hardcastle called 999 reporting his son had fallen on a coffee table while playing. Police and parmedics rushed to the flat bit were instantly sceptical about the account Hardcastle gave. Attempts had been made to clean blood from the floor and bloodstained clothes and bedding had been placed in bin bags and the washing machine.\n\nScans and a post mortem confirmed Damion had suffered a litany of injuries over at least three days before the serious head injury which resulted in his death. Among them were a bite mark to his leg, which Hardcastle claimed he had caused during 'rough play' a week earlier. However experts said Damion must have been in agony and screaming as a result of the injury.\n\nThere were also a number of fractured ribs and a serious injury to Damion's mouth where is fther had forced a sippy cup into his face, causing his lip to detach from his gum.\n\nSentencing, Mrs Justice Hill said: \"By assaulting Damion in this way you grossly abused your position of trust. You were Damion's father and he was in your sole care. He was a helpless child. It was your duty as his father to protect him, especially given the difficult start he had in life and his inability to rely on his mother to care for him.\"\n\nHardcastle sat in the dock with his head bowed as the judge passed sentence. He showed no emotion as he was led to the cells.\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter LANCS LIVE NEWS and get all the biggest stories from across Lancashire direct to your inbox", "source": {"uri": "lancs.live", "dataType": "news", "title": "accrington"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_smith@lancs.live", "name": "Rachel Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Hardcastle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Hardcastle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foster care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_Crown_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preston Crown Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bruise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_nursery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plant nursery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blackpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Blackpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghull", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maghull"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maghull"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justice Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_dentistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forensic dentistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rib fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29519131.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Man-guilty-of-murdering-son.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722640", "eventUri": "eng-9722640", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-08-", "textStart": 337, "textEnd": 346, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

After a two-week trial, the jury has been asked to consider whether Hardcastle was responsible for the death of his son, either by murder or manslaughter.\n\n(Proceeding)\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter LANCS LIVE NEWS and get all the biggest stories from across Lancashire direct to your inbox", "source": {"uri": "lancs.live", "dataType": "news", "title": "accrington"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_smith@lancs.live", "name": "Rachel Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blackpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Blackpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Manchester_Children's_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Manchester Children's Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Life support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool_Victoria_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blackpool Victoria Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievous_bodily_harm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grievous bodily harm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i2-prod.lancs.live/incoming/article27633858.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Danny-Potter-aka-Daniel-Hardcastle-6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722640", "eventUri": "eng-9722640", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-21", "textStart": 962, "textEnd": 971}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-08-", "textStart": 409, "textEnd": 418}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

But Hardcastle's defence counsel claimed the experts' views were \"just theories,\" not backed up by fact.\n\n\"What is the definition of a theory?\" Mr Jones asked the jury in his closing speech. \"A theory is an idea, or a set of ideas which are intended to explain facts and events.\n\n\"These experts were not there. They gave (their) opinion to explain facts and events as to what could have happened. That's as far as they go.\n\n\"That is the danger of this. You have to be satisfied so you are sure that Damion died because his father killed him. That's it.\n\n\"If you are sure of that you will find him guilty and properly so. Your duty is to give a true verdict according to the evidence and it is not sheer guesswork or speculation.\"\n\nReferring to the famous case of Baby P - the death of 17-month old Peter Connolly in London in 2007 after months of cruelty inflicted by those who were meant to be caring for him - Mr Jones said: \"You will have come across cases where there is serial cruelty, neglect and maltreatment of children.\n\n\"Children who have been neglected all their lives, maltreated all their lives, for instance Baby P. This is not that sort of case.\n\n\"This case is about something that happened on the 19th of August last year, catastrophic in its consequences, of that there is no doubt. Tragic, of that there is no doubt.\"\n\nMr Jones said there had been evidence from three different groups: Experts, police officers and \"those who knew Damion and saw the defendant and the boy together.\n\n\"The police officers came in after, the experts came in well after the event. But the evidence of what Daniel Hardcastle and Damion were like (together) at the time is evidence which the experts have ignored, either because it was not relevant or not consistent with their theories.\"\n\nThe lawyer related evidence from a host of witnesses who had told the court that they had never had the slightest concern about Hardcastle's behaviour as a father or his ability to look after his child.\n\nSome had confirmed the little boy had been unsteady on his feet and had seen him fall on \"numerous occasions.\"\n\nOne nursery worker said: \"It was obviously a loving relationship.\" Hardcastle, she said, had been \"a very caring dad who only wanted the best for Damion.\" The toddler had been \"well cared for, always well dressed and clean.\" And she added: \"He was doing his best.\"\n\nAnd the court had been shown video footage of Hardcastle arriving at nursery to pick up his son and the little boy reaching out his arms to greet his dad. That was, Mr Jones said, evidence that their relationship \"was based on mutual affection and love.\"\n\nHe added: \"That is all the evidence we have in this case. They are experts in their own right. They may not have degrees or doctorates to their name, but they are experts in looking after vulnerable children.\n\n\"If anything was wrong can you imagine how quickly they would have reacted?\n\n\"This was a man who was warming to the task (of caring for his son), who was able to discharge that task and was loving the task.\n\n\"No-one could say Daniel Hardcastle was perfect. He wasn't. There were shortcomings, of that there is no doubt.\n\n\"But it is impossible he could have misled them (childcare workers), he could not possibly have done that.\"\n\nMr Jones said the prosecution case, based on medical evidence, was that the boy had suffered \"several injuries caused over several days, repeated assaults upon Damion, deliberately to hurt the child with the intention of causing serious injury, not just neglect.\"\n\nHe concluded the prosecution had sought to show that Hardcastle had \"deliberately, intentionally and wilfully\" inflicted injury and pain on his son.\n\nYet there had not been a single person in the case who had spoken about bad behaviour by Hardcastle which could have harmed the boy. \"On the contrary, he was a good father who was doing his best in trying to bring up his son.\n\n\"Let us therefore abandon theories, let us concentrate on the evidence. The prosecution say the defendant is guilty of murder, the deliberate inflicting of injuries with intent to cause death or really serious harm.\n\n\"Daniel Hardcastle says it was a catastrophic incident, but it occurred by accident.\n\n\"It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are, if it doesn't fit the evidence it's wrong.\n\n\"(Some of) the evidence may put the defendant in a bad light, it may show there are certain things which were wrong (at the home) in Central Drive. But it doesn't prove that he is a killer.\"\n\nTrial judge The Honourable Mrs Justice King is expected to send the jury out on Tuesday to consider its verdict.", "source": {"uri": "lep.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lancashire Evening Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vanessa_sims@lep.co.uk", "name": "Vanessa Sims", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Hardcastle", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Hardcastle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "King's Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blunt trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blackpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Blackpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Connolly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Connolly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evidence-based medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doctorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military discharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence_Based_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence Based Medicine", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.lep.co.uk/jpim-static/image/2024/07/04/10/18/Single-dad-Daniel-Hardcastle-from-Blackpool-is-accused-of-killing-his-toddler-son-and-has-admitted-i.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&trim=326,0,34,0&crop=", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722640", "eventUri": "eng-9722640", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "textStart": 2543, "textEnd": 2557}], "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

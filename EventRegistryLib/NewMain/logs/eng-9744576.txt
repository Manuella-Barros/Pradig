If we always worried about what people thought, then a lot of the things we love would've never been made.\"\n\nOriginal article source: Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey both skip deodorant, prefer to go 'au naturale,' actress confirms", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deodorant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deodorant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kate Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hudson River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Goreski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Goreski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldie_Hawn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goldie Hawn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_What_Happens_Live_with_Andy_Cohen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Cohen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perfume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sirius XM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Nicole_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Nicole Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glee_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glee (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Employment", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Smell_and_Taste", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Smell and Taste", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dGYnSX.Yy1Iz3U57nNbHnQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_fox_news_text_745/fc879fa552d94cdaa9621cd646139825", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744576", "eventUri": "eng-9744576", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 117, "textEnd": 124}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Early in their careers, Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey starred in some memorable rom-coms together: How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days and Fool's Gold. During the production of the latter, a rumor ran around the actress had forced her co-star to wear deodorant and, of course, Andy Cohen had to ask about it.\n\nHudson was seemingly startled the old \"urban legend\" got brought up again during a fan Q&A portion of her recent Watch What Happens Live appearance. Answering with a vociferous \"no,\" the actress and mom of three clarified the truth about the Texas actor, confirming there is a deodorant-related story about McConaughey- but it has nothing to do with her.\n\nClearly, the lack of deodorant wasn't a huge problem for the two stars. They appeared together in their first movie in 2003 and then got back into the rom-com game again in 2008 with Fool's Gold. I'm assuming if there were any real smell issues she simply wouldn't have said \"yes\" to a second movie.\n\nFans who keep up with the Matthew McConaughey probably already know his deodorant use has been nonexistent for decades. I once even saw a reddit thread where a fan referred to the actor as \"Intersmellar,\" so it's a relatively widely known thing. He himself has commented on his penchant for hating deodorant, telling People in 2005 he hadn't \"worn deodorant in 20 years\" - and that was nearly 20 years ago.\n\nHis co-star Yvette Nicole Brown also commented on this a few years ago, noting that McConaughey skips the antiperspirant but does \"smell like good living.\" So it's clear his personal hygiene isn't a huge issue for the people he shares the screen with. And it is worth pointing out that by 2014 McConaughey did tell the Los Angeles Times he is less rigid with the \"no deodorant\" rule these days and does sometimes wear it-- when he's trying to make a good first impression.\n\nWhile Matthew McConaughey's rom-com days had seemingly been behind him, but as the genre is making a comeback, there is some chatter there could be another How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days with him and Hudson. This would make sense, given it's the rom-com McConaughey still makes the most money from.

Kate Hudson is here to answer the Hollywood urban legend about Matthew McConaughey's hygiene. It's not something any of us should think about when it comes to celebrities, but the rumor has haunted him for decades. Does the 54-year-old actor have body odor?\n\nWell, leave it to his two-time co-star to clear up the gossip on the July 17 episode of Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. Hudson even shocked the audience with a revelation!\n\n\"Was that old urban legend true that you forced Matthew McConaughey to wear deodorant while filming Fool's Gold?\" Cohen read a fan-submitted question.\n\n\"No. He doesn't wear deodorant -- and by the way, I don't either,\" Hudson surprisingly responded.\n\nShe had more other say about McConaughey's scent, adding, \"My thing was that I could smell him from a mile [away] because we were so close. We're au naturale.\"\n\nMcConaughey seems to be the one who started the Hudson rumor though in an old interview with Maxim, via Brobible. \"She always brings a salt rock, which is some natural deodorant and says, \"Would you please put this on?\" I just never wore it. No cologne, no deodorant,\" he claimed. \"The women in my life, including my mother, have all said, 'Hey, your natural smell smells, one, like a man, and two, smells like you.'\" So, deodorant isn't his jam, but being clean actually is.\n\nHe told Playboy, via BroBible, that he showers more than once a day, and his oral hygiene is even better. The Oscar winner reportedly brushes his teeth \"up to five times,\" so fans shouldn't be too worried about how clean he is. McConaughey \"doesn't like to smell like someone or something else\" -- fair enough!\n\nAnd if Hudson's confirmation wasn't enough, McConaughey's Tropic Thunder co-star Yvette Nicole Brown did the true detective work for all of us. \"I remember that Matthew McConaughey said that he did not use deodorant and that he didn't have an odor. So, my first thought was, 'I'm going to get as close as I can to him to see if he's right,'\" she said on SiriusXM via the Daily Mail. \"He does not have an odor. He smells like granola and good living. He has a sweet, sweet scent. That is just him, and it's not musty or crazy.\"\n\nNow, fans can rest easy.

If we always worried about what people thought, then a lot of the things we love would've never been made.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lori_bashian@foxnews.com", "name": "Lori Bashian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Governors_Association", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Governors Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deodorant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deodorant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hudson River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Goreski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Goreski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldie_Hawn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goldie Hawn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kate Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_What_Happens_Live_with_Andy_Cohen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sirius XM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Cohen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perfume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Nicole_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Nicole Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glee_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glee (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1024/512/matthew-mcconaughey-kate-hudson.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744576", "eventUri": "eng-9744576", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

But when How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days hit theaters in 2003, fans were convinced that was about to change. Despite what the title suggests, the movie ends with Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson's characters confessing their feelings and kissing. It was a textbook \"happily ever after\" moment that left fans satisfied. At least, it did until romantic movies started getting sequels.\n\nSince How To Lose A Guy was iconic for subverting expectations, it makes sense that fans would want a sequel to one of the best romantic comedies of the aughts. They're not the only ones, either. In a recent interview with Andy Cohan on Bravos' Watch What Happens Live, Hudson opened about what it would take to reunite the star and get a sequel greenlit:\n\nFinding the right script seems to be a common theme when it comes to sequels and reboots. Unlike The Parent Trap's Lisa Ann Walter's who was quick to share her ideas for a potential sequel, Hudson wants to leave that up to the professionals. Now, I may not be a professional in any sense of the word, but as a rom-com connoisseur, I do have some fun theories about what could happen in a potential sequel.\n\nWhen it comes to sequels set decades after the original, the common decision is to center them around the next generation. It would definitely work for a How To Lose sequel. Maybe Andie and Benjamin's child is having relationship troubles and turns to their parents for help. Of course, Andie and Ben's advice is outdated in the modern world of dating, so it ends up being disastrous rather than helpful. In the process, the married couple could reminisce about the unconventional way they got together all those years ago.\n\nOne of the reasons How To Lose Your Guy worked so well is because of Hudson and McConaughey's palpable chemistry and the willingness of their characters to commit to the bit. I would love to see that same energy manifest in a sequel, and I think I have the perfect idea for how.\n\nPicture this: Andie and Ben have been married for decades; they've raised kids, had successful careers, and ultimately have lived the life of their dreams. Somewhere along the line, though, they lost their romantic spark. They both know they're heading for divorce, but neither wants to be the one to file so they don't have to be the bad guy in their kids' eyes. Instead, they decide to dig into their own playbooks and begin to scheme and prank each other in the hopes the other caves.\n\nJust like the original, though, Andie and Ben end up growing closer despite their divorce plans and realize this is what their relationship has been missing. In the end, they renew their vows at a beautiful ceremony surrounded by their friends and family.\n\nLike I said, I'm not a professional screenwriter by any means, so I'm sure a more seasoned veteran could come up with a better idea. The point is that there are viable options to make a sequel work if Hollywood wants it to. It would be even easier knowing that Hudson is on board and McConaughey won't have to be convinced by a fortune teller to take the role.\n\nIn the meantime, fans can revisit the classic rom-com, which is streaming on Paramount+ with an active subscription.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danielle_bruncati@cinemablend.com", "name": "Danielle Bruncati", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kate Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_What_Happens_Live_with_Andy_Cohen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Parent_Trap_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Parent Trap (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_joke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Practical joke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screenwriter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ExbmCc3ALBYn3YsCrSjyLZ-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744576", "eventUri": "eng-9744576", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The 2003 rom-com starred Hudson alongside Matthew McConaughey. Hudson is open to How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days 2 if the script is right.\n\nKate Hudson discusses the potential for a sequel to How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. The 2003 movie stars Hudson alongside Matthew McConaughey, the latter of whom plays a man named Benjamin Barry, who works as an advertising executive and has the hubris to believe that he can make a woman fall in love with him in only 10 days. How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days was directed by Donald Petrie, and in addition to Hudson and McConaughey, features a leading cast including Adam Goldberg, Kathryn Hahn, Annie Parisse, Thomas Lennon, and Michael Michele.\n\nSpeaking with Watch What Happens Live (via Deadline), Hudson discusses the possibility of making a sequel to How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. Hudson said that she believed that a How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days sequel was always being thought about, even if it never came to fruition. For a sequel to be made, the actor believes that \"all that matters would be the script and if Matthew [McConaughey] and [her] would be into the script.\" If these conditions were met, Hudson suggested that she would be open to joining the project. Check out the full quote from Hudson below:\n\n\"I think they're always thinking about that. All that matters would be the script and if Matthew and I would be into the script. I think we're both totally open but it's just never happened.\"\n\nHow Matthew McConaughey's Career Has Evolved Since How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days McConaughey Has Largely Departed From Rom-Com Close\n\nHow to Lose a Guy in 10 Days came relatively early on in McConaughey's career, when he was more actively engaged in the rom-com genre. Some of McConaughey's other titles around that time included The Wedding Planner and Tiptoes, both of which were also early 2000s romantic comedies. The actor's ineffable charm led to success in this genre, a charisma which is especially evident in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. As Benjamin Barry, he had to have the slickness (or sliminess) of an advertiser in addition to the smoothness of trying to win someone over romantically.\n\nRelated Matthew McConaughey's Rom-Com Roles, Ranked (According To Rotten Tomatoes)\n\nAccording to Rotten Tomatoes, these are Matthew McConaughey's best romantic movies for the sappy fan in all of us.\n\nSince then, McConaughey's career has shifted significantly in terms of genre. While there are exceptions, the actor's work in the last decade has included more serious, dramatic projects, including Interstellar, True Detective season 1, and The Sea of Trees. Even his comedic work is more in the realm of dark comedy, such as The Gentlemen. The actor's upcoming works include other dramatic tales, such as the films The Rivals of Amziah King and The Lost Bus.\n\nAs such, a How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days sequel would be a departure from McConaughey's current trends. If he were to make a sequel, or any romantic comedy for that matter, it would be a return to roots for the actor, who has strayed away from the genre as he has continued his career. Even if there are no active plans for How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days 2 in the works, it would make for an interesting sequel if Hudson and McConaughey are as open as the former would seem to suggest.\n\nSource: Deadline", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brennan_klein@screenrant.com", "name": "Brennan Klein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "megan_hemenway@screenrant.com", "name": "Megan Hemenway", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "daniel_tinaglia@screenrant.com", "name": "Daniel Tinaglia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "amanda_mullen@screenrant.com", "name": "Amanda Mullen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "stephen_holland@screenrant.com", "name": "Stephen Holland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kate Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Petrie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Petrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Michele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Michele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Lennon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Lennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Parisse", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annie Parisse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Goldberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Goldberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Hahn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kathryn Hahn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotten Tomatoes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_What_Happens_Live_with_Andy_Cohen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Detective", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "True Detective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rivals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Rivals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interstellar (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black comedy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/how-to-lose-a-guy-in-10-days-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744576", "eventUri": "eng-9744576", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Hudson quipped that producers \"are always thinking about that\" before revealing her one request for a second film. \"All that matters would be the script and if Matthew and I were into the script,\" she said. \"I think we're both totally open, it has just never happened.\"\n\nThe movie stars Hudson as journalist Andie Anderson, who's writing an article about getting a man to dump her in ten days, and McConaughey as marketing exec Benjamin Berry, who makes a bet with his boss that he can make any woman fall in love with him in ten days. The plot follows the pair as they use each other to work toward their opposing goals, and ultimately fall in love.\n\nThe film opened to mixed reviews from critics but was a box-office success, cementing itself as a rom-com classic over the next two decades.\n\nHudson already has one idea for the script that she'd be happy with. In a 2023 interview with Vanity Fair to celebrate the film's 20th anniversary, the actor envisioned where Andie and Ben would be today. \"My hope is that they are happy, they've got a bunch of kids, they got married, and they're still playing Bullsh*t with his parents,\" she said.\n\nShe also acknowledged that their lives wouldn't actually be that perfect. \"If there was a sequel, I'm sure there would be some conflict in there somewhere,\" she said.\n\nBack in 2020, McConaughey also shared his thoughts on a potential 10 Days sequel in an interview with E!'s Daily Pop, saying he would possibly return for another movie, despite previously stating that he was done making rom-coms for the time being.\n\n\"I mean, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is teed up for one that you could easily do a sequel,\" he said. \"As far as romantic comedies go, that was a really good one.

Nice.\n\nDuring an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen that aired on Wednesday, the actress was asked about the long-standing rumour suggesting her co-star and friend isn't a fan of using deodorant products.\n\n'Was that old urban legend true that you forced Matthew McConaughey to wear deodorant while filming Fool's Gold?' host Andy asked, referring to Kate and Matthew's 2008 movie.\n\nIn response, the star confirmed the speculation was true.\n\n'No. He doesn't wear deodorant - and by the way, I don't either,' she divulged.\n\nKate went on to joke that she could smell Matthew 'from a mile (away)' on the set of Fool's Gold and that 'they got so close' while filming the romantic comedy action flick.\n\n'We're au naturels,' the 45-year-old laughed, not elaborating on why she doesn't like to use deodorant.\n\nMeanwhile, Matthew doesn't appear to be a fan of sweat-masking products at all.\n\n'A man should smell like a man. I haven't worn deodorant in 20 years,' he said in his People Sexiest Man Alive cover story back in 2005.\n\nIn a 2021 interview for Australia's Kyle and Jackie O Show, Matthew revealed that he doesn't use aftershave but wears his own 'homemade concoctions'.\n\n'You knew I was a mixologist, didn't you?' he continued, before refusing to reveal his secret list of ingredients: 'I couldn't dare say that out loud.'\n\nThis comes after it was rumoured Brad Pitt is another celeb who is historically unfussed about personal hygiene routines - with claims he didn't shower often until girlfriend Ines de Ramon came along in 2022.\n\n'He's really reformed for Ines,' an insider claimed to In Touch. 'Brad used to be quite lackadaisical about taking showers and washing his hair, and only wanting to use soap and water when he did shower and refusing to use deodorant or cologne.\n\n'He'd often go a day or two without bathing, which is astonishing given he's such a huge sex symbol, but with Ines, it's a different story.\n\n'He's gone out of his way to change his smelly ways.'\n\nBrad's supposed smelly transformation is also said to extend to his wardrobe too, which insiders say has experienced a glow up in recent years.\n\n'Brad's generally paying more attention to clothes he wears and letting her pick out his cologne. She's even got him flossing his teeth,' they added. 'Now, they love to go out and get pampered at the spa together, like massages and facials.\n\n'He loves moisturisers and skin creams too; he's upped his game in this area to everyone's relief.'\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Bianca Censori forgets trousers and flashes bum at posh dinner with Kanye West\n\nMORE : Rising pop star complains she is now too famous to take drugs in public", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kitty_chrisp@metro.co.uk", "name": "Kitty Chrisp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deodorant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deodorant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kate Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fool's_Gold_Records", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fool's Gold Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_What_Happens_Live_with_Andy_Cohen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aftershave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bartender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perfume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuff_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuff (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Touch_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "In Touch Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisturizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moisturizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_symbol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex symbol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SEC_213392212-9a59.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744576", "eventUri": "eng-9744576", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

It had all the essentials: major chemistry between Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey, an iconic yellow dress moment, and an off-key \"You're So Vain\" performance. Fans aren't the only ones who think so, either. During a July 17 appearance on Watch What Happens Live, Hudson discussed the possibility of a sequel with host Andy Cohen, and apparently, both she and McConaughey are \"totally\" open to a sequel, revisiting their characters Andie Anderson and Benjamin Barry.\n\nPer Deadline, when Cohen asked if they had ever considered creating a follow-up to the iconic romantic comedy, Hudson confirmed they had thought about making a second movie. \"I think they're always thinking about that,\" she said, even 21 years later.\n\nAccording to Hudson, the most important factor would be a high-quality script. \"All that matters would be the script and if Matthew and I were into the script,\" she continued. \"I think we're both totally open, it has just never happened.\"\n\nThe movie followed Andie and Ben's tumultuous relationship as she attempted to \"lose\" him within a 10-day window for an article she was writing, and he was trying to get her to fall in love with him as part of a workplace bet. Spoiler alert: They ended up happily ever after, riding off into the sunset on Ben's motorcycle.\n\nHudson and McConaughey might need a script before they're fully on board, but fans of the film don't share that hesitation. After Deadline shared a post on IG about the possibility of a sequel, plenty of commenters were excited about the potential. \"Yes please. Frost us!\" one wrote. Another responded, \"Please. I beg.\"\n\nBut not everyone is overjoyed about more sequels. ICYMI, in July, a Devil Wears Prada 2 was confirmed (and Meryl Streep is reportedly reprising her role). In March, Lindsay Lohan confirmed Freaky Friday 2 was happening. The trend might be taking over Hollywood, but fans aren't totally happy about it. \"Can we stop with the sequels?\" one critic wrote in reference to a potential How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days 2. Another commented, \"Enough with the remakes and sequels \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f.\"", "source": {"uri": "elitedaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Elite Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kate Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Cohen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You're_So_Vain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "You're So Vain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_What_Happens_Live_with_Andy_Cohen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freaky_Friday", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freaky Friday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Remake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meryl Streep"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Lohan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lindsay Lohan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/shutterstock/2024/7/19/88500b62/shutterstock-5884281e.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&fm=jpg&fp-x=0.5152&fp-y=0.3614", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744576", "eventUri": "eng-9744576", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 299, "textEnd": 306}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

But there's certainly more hope for it today than there was a week ago.\n\nWWHL host Andy Cohen is clearly also a fan of the film, as he cued up the convo by asking Hudson if they'd ever considered making a follow-up. \"I think they're always thinking about that,\" Hudson admitted.\n\nAs is often the case when there's talk of a nostalgic movie being revisited, though, it all comes down to the script. \"All that matters would be the script and if Matthew and I were into the script,\" she said. \"I think we're both totally open; it has just never happened.\"\n\nAs Hudson hinted during her WWHL appearance, McConaughey would also be open to bringing back the iconic duo of Andie and Ben. In 2020, while speaking with E!'s Daily Pop, he said, \"I mean, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is teed up for one that you could easily do a sequel. And that was a really good one. As far as romantic comedies go, that was a really good one.\"\n\nHe also nodded to the enduring appeal of the film, pointing out, \"And it lasts! People still love that one. I enjoyed that one quite a bit.\"\n\nDirector Donald Petrie told Vanity Fair in an interview for the movie's 20th anniversary that his primary concern with a sequel would be its stars. \"I don't know how you would do it, frankly; I don't think it would be the same without Kate and Matthew in it,\" he said, adding, \"It would have to be a writer coming in with an amazing pitch of how they're going to sequel-ize this.\"\n\nSince Hudson and McConaughey both seem game, guess it's just a matter of finding the right script!\n\nAs for the rest of the incredible cast -- Kathryn Hahn, Annie Parisse, Adam Goldberg, Thomas Lennon, Michael Michele, Shalom Harlow -- not much has been documented about how they might be feeling.\n\nHowever, Hahn and Hudson reunited in 2022 for Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, and the women have had nothing but glowing praise for one another.\n\n\"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days was my first film, and that Kate was the lead of it was just such a mind-blowing experience for me,\" Hahn told People in a 2023 interview. \"So then to come full circle and be in this movie with her again, it's just been so thrilling. And to see her heart has remained the same, I'm so moved by all of it.\"\n\nHudson told The Hollywood Reporter that working with Hahn again was \"the best,\" referring to the two of them as \"soul sisters.\"\n\nSomething tells us this entire cast would be down to revisit the days of off-key renditions of \"You're So Vain\" and Krull the Warrior King.\n\nBased on Michele Alexander and Jeannie Long's satirical stick-figure book of the same name, the movie centers on Hudson as Andie Anderson, an advice columnist for a magazine, and McConaughey as Benjamin Barry, a hotshot advertising exec.\n\nTo help a friend (Hahn) dodge an assignment, Andie pitches an article chronicling her efforts to \"lose\" a guy in 10 days doing all the cliche things women do in a relationship that tend to scare men off. Little does she know, Ben simultaneously takes a workplace bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days. And since a huge account is riding on his success, he's in it to win it.\n\nSpoiler alert: This romcom has a happy ending that includes Andie and Ben riding off into the sunset on his motorcycle, their neglected love fern in tow.\n\nSpeaking with WWHL's Cohen, Hudson shared what she wishes life would look like for her fictional counterpart these days. \"My hope is that [Andie and Ben] are happy, they've got a bunch of kids, they got married, and they're still playing Bullshit with his parents,\" she said before acknowledging, \"If there was a sequel, I'm sure there would be some conflict in there somewhere.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, the authors of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days have two other books that could serve as inspiration: How to Get Over a Guy in 10 Days and How to Get a Guy in 10 Days.\n\nEven if the stars don't align for the OG cast to reprise their roles, this still feels like a film that deserves the reboot treatment. Or maybe we just throw the idea of a sequel out the window and go the remake route -- in which case, our vote is for Glen Powell to become the new Ben.\n\nIf nothing else ever comes from the How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days world, though, fans could always just take a page straight out of Andie's book and use Photoshop to composite an updated faux family album for the beloved nostalgic film.",

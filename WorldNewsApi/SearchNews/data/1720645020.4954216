Slightly cooler weather was expected through the weekend, but the National Weather Service warned it will be short-lived relief before the unseasonably hot weather returns next week. Excessive heat warnings finally expired Friday evening across most of the Southwest, but continue through Saturday in Las Vegas, where its never been hotter this time of year. \u201cThe heat wave will lose its grip on our region by Saturday evening,\u201d the National Weather Service in Las Vegas said late Friday. The new weather pattern should lead to \u201cincreased cloud cover and slightly cooler temperatures into early next week,\u201d the weather service in Phoenix said. But \u201ctemperatures heat up again for the middle of next week as high pressure builds over the region.\u201d The high of 110 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius) in Las Vegas on Friday edged the old record of 109 F (42.7 C) set in 2013. Thursday\u2019s record high of 111 (43.8 C) equaled the earliest time of the year on record that it had reached 110 or hotter. Temperatures should be 5 to 8 degrees cooler by Sunday in Las Vegas, the weather service said.

And there's no reason to disagree.\n\nKyle Golik for Mike Farrell Sports listed the 10 teams he believes will still be at the top in five years. The Ducks are among the group.\n\nAfter the Mario Cristobal era, Ducks coach Dan Lanning has had Oregon on a steady rise since taking over in 2022. His Ducks have notched back-to-back 10-wins seasons, finishing with AP ranks of 15 and 6, respectively.\n\nBut its off the field that has Golik impressed. Oregon's 2025 class is littered with highly ranked commits, placing the Ducks with the No. 4 class from On3, No. 5 class from 247Sports, and No. 6 class form Rivals.\n\nAll that momentum leads into a season with one specific date circled in red ink.\n\n\"As Dan Lanning continues to be scorching hot in the Class of 2025 with the No. 5 overall class, Lanning's aggressiveness to build Oregon has been on full display,\" Golik writes. \"With the inaugural Big Ten season for Oregon, the stakes couldn't be any higher for their October 12 clash with Ohio State. A win only adds to the inferno that is burning in Eugene, a loss won't extinguish it but can slow it down.\n\n\"The talent Lanning is assembling in Eugene is worthy to be near the top of the country, only thing Oregon has to do is produce results.\"\n\nRanked ahead of the Ducks are Ohio State and Texas. The rest of the group behind Oregon is Georgia, USC, Oklahoma, Alabama, Florida State, Nebraska, and Notre Dame.

While non-conference games dominate the early schedule, eyes are on the first Big Ten Conference game on September 28 against, as fate would have it, old Pac-12 foe, UCLA. The first encounter with an existing Big Ten team is October 4 versus Michigan State.\n\nOverall, the Ducks have struggled somewhat with the Big Ten, posting an overall record of 22-35 (without including the records vs. incoming teams Washington, USC, UCLA) Let's take a closer look at Oregon's record against individual teams, noting the Ducks have never played Rutgers and Maryland.\n\nIllinois Fighting Illini\n\nThe last meeting between these two teams on September 9, 1995 resulted in an Oregon victory, 34-31. Overall, the Ducks are 2-1 against the Fighting Illini.\n\nOregon leads this series, 2-1, but the teams have not played since September 11, 2004. The Hoosiers prevailed in that contest, 30-24. These teams do not play in the 2024 season, but this is not likely to be one of the more difficult games when the teams finally meet.\n\nMichigan State Spartans\n\nThe Ducks and Spartans have played seven times with Oregon winning four. The most recent matchup was on December 31, 2018 in the Red Box Bowl with the Ducks scratching out a 7-6 win. There are two reasons this game in October holds significant interest. This game will be Oregon's first against an original Big Ten school. The second is that Spartans head coach is Jonathan Smith, who left Oregon State for the job in Lansing.\n\nOhio State Buckeyes\n\nHistory is not on Oregon's side in previous meetings as the Buckeyes have won 9 of the 10 games played. However, the Ducks won the last contest, a 35-28 victory on September 11, 2021. The matchup on October 12 at Autzen Stadium is being touted as perhaps the best game on the 2024 college football schedule. Both teams are serious contenders for the Big Ten and National Championships on a regular basis and, as such, you can disregard the outcome of prior contests.\n\nPurdue Boilermakers\n\nOregon leads this head-to-head series, 2-1. The last time these two teams met on the football field was September 12, 2009 and ended with a Ducks' victory, 38-36. All signs point to Oregon dominating the Boilermakers over time and improving on their overall record.\n\nNorthwestern Wildcats\n\nThese teams have played only once and that was nearly 50 years ago. In that game, the Wildcats scratched out a 14-10 win over the Ducks. These teams will not play each other in 2024 so Oregon will need to wait for an opportunity to even the record against Northwestern.\n\nMinnesota Gophers\n\nThis is another head-to-head matchup that has not been in Oregon's favor. The Ducks are 1-3 against the Gophers. The most recent game was December 31, 2003 in the Sun Bowl as Minnesota outscored the Ducks 31-30. This is another team the Ducks will not face in 2024 but will have a chance to improve their record when they host the Gophers in Autzen Stadium in 2025.\n\nPenn State Nittany Lions\n\nOregon is 1-3 against Penn State, but they have not played since the Nittany Lions posted a Rose Bowl win on January 2, 1995, 38-20. Unfortunately, the Ducks do not get a rematch and a chance to close the overall record against Penn State until 2027.\n\nNebraska Cornhuskers\n\nThe bad news is that Oregon trails Nebraska in their head-to-head meetings, going 2-6 against the Cornhuskers. The good news is that the last game played was on September 9, 2017 and ended with a 42-35 win for the Ducks. This game could evolve into an interesting rivalry with the Ducks anxious to close the gap on that overall record.\n\nIowa Hawkeyes\n\nOregon leads this matchup, 2-1, although the teams have not played since 1994. In that game, the Ducks dominated the Hawkeyes, 40-18. This is another team Oregon will not face in 2024. They will have to wait for another opportunity to post a victory over Iowa.\n\nWisconsin Badgers\n\nOregon and Wisconsin have played six times with each team winning three. The most recent game was a January 1, 2020 Rose Bowl win for the Ducks, 28-27. This matchup has usually produced some exciting football and there isn't any reason why the November 16 game won't be the same as both teams look to take a lead in the overall series.\n\nThere is an old saying that \"past performance is no guarantee of future results.\" Given all the changes and the results produced by coach Dan Lanning so far, Ducks' fans can throw that below .500 record against the Big Ten out the window. This is a whole new era and one Oregon is likely to dominate for years to come.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Every loss has been against a ranked team, with three losses against Washington and one against the 2022 national title winning Georgia Bulldogs.\n\nWithout question, Lanning is maximizing the talent he's bringing to campus.

One topic that's always fun to discuss is deciding which program has the best wide receiver duo in the nation. ESPN's David Pollack reveals which school he believes has a \"freakish\" duo ahead of the 2024 season.\n\nPollack took to social media on Wednesday morning and named Tez Johnson and Evan Stewart of the Oregon Ducks as his \"freakish\" duo in college football. The ESPN analyst does leave room for debate, as he does state \"Feel free to argue deepest.\" However, David Pollack firmly believes the Ducks have the best wide receiver duo in the country.\n\nWhen it comes to which team has the best duo, it's hard to argue against Pollack. Tez Johnson and Evan Stewart are absolute monsters that any college quarterback would love to have. Johnson played three seasons at Troy before transferring to Oregon. He is a tad undersized but he proved to be a difference-maker for the Ducks after recording 86 receptions, 1,182 yards and 10 touchdowns.\n\nMeanwhile, Stewart is a wide receiver Dan Lanning acquired through the transfer portal this offseason. He was consistent with his opportunities at Texas A&M but will now have a more prominent role in Oregon. Stewart finished the 2023 season with 38 receptions, 514 yards, and four touchdowns.\n\nDan Lanning and the Ducks have done a magnificent job of building a star-studded roster for the 2024 season. This will be one of the more exciting teams in college football. Transfer quarterback, Dillon Gabriel is surrounded by a plethora of weapons including Tez Johnson and Evan Stewart. Additionally, the defense is beyond stacked and should keep most opponents at bay.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how this Ducks team handles playing in the Big Ten. They have a relatively tough schedule ahead, as they take on programs such as Ohio State, Michigan, and former Pac-12 rivals Washington. But if Oregon can make the 12-team playoff then they'll have a legitimate chance to win its first National Championship in school history.\n\nOregon's first game of the season doesn't kick-off until August 31 when they take on the Idaho Vandals. The Ducks are one of the most highly anticipated programs in the nation right now as they look like a true contender for a title this season. Nothing is guaranteed, but Dan Lanning has seemingly built a powerhouse in Oregon.\n\nRelated: Oregon Coach Dan Lanning Offers Condolences to Khyree Jackson After Tragic Death\n\nRelated: Auburn's 4-Star Commit Shockingly Admits There is 1 Other School He's Still Considering", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benedetto_vitale@postandcourier.com", "name": "Benedetto Vitale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pollack", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Pollack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Stewart_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Evan Stewart (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Lanning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Lanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Ducks_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon Ducks football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A&M_Aggies_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas A&M Aggies football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillon_Gabriel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dillon Gabriel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_Vandals_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Idaho Vandals football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/College and University", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/ba/7ba13045-5e13-5cf5-b124-619251545369/668eb88624970.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722351", "eventUri": "eng-9722351", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-31", "textStart": 2153, "textEnd": 2162}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Those teams are USC, UCLA -- the initial teams to announce their departure in 2022 -- and Oregon and Washington, who declared their departure from the West Coast conference before the season started last year.\n\nAll four schools bring their own unique value to the Big Ten in the upcoming 2024 season. But one team, in particular, has the edge over the other three: the Oregon Ducks, who were last year's runner-up in the Pac-12 Championship Game against Washington.\n\nThe Ducks are becoming one of the elite powerhouse teams in all of college football. College football analyst Josh Pate seems to believe so, too, as he named them in his Top 15 programs to dominate over the next three years.\n\n\"It is very likely you're looking at the next superpower in college football,\" Pate said on his show Late Kick Live.\n\nPate ranked Oregon at No. 4, just below Georgia, Alabama, and Ohio State.\n\nOregon has been building themselves up to a premier program going back to the 2000 season under head coach Mike Bellotti. Since then, they've won 10 or more games in 14 of those seasons, with 10 top-10 finishes, 12 bowl wins, and two national championship appearances.\n\nBut as Pate states, they're missing just one thing that puts them in the league with the rest of the elite teams.\n\n\"You know the brand. You know the duck on the motorcycle. You know the 50 million different uniform combos. What you don't know is Oregon perennial national championship contender,\" Pate said.\n\nThe Ducks have yet to ever claim a national title, in any era. They've won 14 conference titles.\n\nOregon has become one of the top schools in talent acquisition, going back to when Mario Cristobal took over the program in 2018. The now-Miami head coach brought in the No. 13, 8, 14, and 7 classes. Dan Lanning then followed that up with the No. 16 class in 2022, the No. 9 ranked team last year, No. 4 this year, and currently holds the No. 5 ranked class in 2025.\n\nWhat makes Lanning's work so impressive, however, is how he has utilized the new era of college football to his ultimate advantage with his use of one of the country's top NIL programs, Division Street, led by Nike's Phil Knight. That, of course, has helped bring in top tier classes in recruiting and the transfer portal.\n\nSo far, under Lanning, the Ducks are 22-5. They lost just two games last year, both to Washington. If they would have beaten the Huskies in the Pac-12 title game, they likely would have been one of the top four teams in the College Football Playoff.\n\nOregon comes into the Big Ten this season as likely a preseason top-five team. They have 10 returning starters and have the ranked fifth-best blue-chip ratio at 76 percent, according to CBS Sports.\n\n\"They are now the dominant team on the west coast,\" Pate said.\n\nThey'll open their season at home against Idaho on Sat., Aug. 31 at 7:30 p.m. EST.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Although there has been plenty of July fireworks for Duck fans and a few more might be coming our way.\n\nThe good news is every day the transition to football discussions inches closer. We'll have Fall camp before you know it and soon after, we'll all be back in Autzen watching Oregon with new uniforms and new B1G logos everywhere.\n\nWith the new conference brings new opponents. Like many of you, I'm saddened to see the Pac-12 go, but also excited to see the new conference forge new rivalries of its own.\n\nNow before I get started, one asterisk to this list. Look, every one on planet earth can't wait for Oct. 12 in Eugene when the Ducks host Ohio State. It's going to be one of the most exciting games of the college football season. Ticket prices are insane, there are no rooms in the hotels or Airbnb's, it's going to be a wild weekend.\n\nWith that in mind, here are my three 'other' three games this season I'm most excited for.\n\nProbably not a game you expected to see on this list. But here's why. For starters, beating up on Boise State would be some nice payback. It feels like the Ducks owe them one, or two. But really it's going to be a tougher-than-expected game. They'll be a good team and should win the MWC. Which should get them into the playoffs. So really if Oregon can win here, we get a good sense of how good this team is early and it would be a quality win under its belt.\n\nLastly, Autzen in September is pretty epic. The weather is usually somewhere between 84-90 degrees at this time. It can make for a real fun day tailgaiting, especially if the Ducks win.\n\nThe return to the 'Big House' in early November. Hopefully mother nature cooperates and it's just cold, not cold and snowy. This will be another game that likely draws a lot of national attention. Michigan will have revenge on its mind but also brings a lot of questions. They won't be as good as they were last year in all likelihood. So the real question is how big of a drop off will we see with this squad? You'll never take them lightly for sure and it is a road game for the Ducks.\n\nThis is also a game that can set the table for Oregon. They'll have Maryland, then Wisconsin left along with my #1 game.\n\nThere are too many reasons to list this as No. 1 but I'll name a few. The last regular season game of the year and Oregon should be looking to finish strong and hopefully be in the mix for a playoff spot. I know traditionally Oregon has finished with the Civil War but times have changed. If a change was inevitable, this is easily the best replacement opponent in what is really viewed as more of a rivalry.\n\nLastly, vengeance for Lanning. Washington won't be very good this year. In fact I'm not sure they'll even win 6 games. This is a chance for Lanning to get the monkey off his back and beat Washington once and for all.

No longer is a freshman a highly anticipated duck emoji adorning Oregon coach Dan Lanning's \"X\" post, they must get ready to face an often monumental escalation of talent under the scrutiny of an unfamiliar Big Ten Conference.\n\nThis year, Oregon is anything but short on weapons. The Ducks' 2024 recruiting class ranks No. 4 in the nation by 247Sports. For their first year in the Big Ten, the Ducks stand behind only the Ohio State Buckeyes for conference recruiting. Overall, the Georgia Bulldogs and the Alabama Crimson Tide have the No. 1 and No. 2 recruiting classes for the 2024 class in college football.\n\nWhen you look at the numbers behind Oregon's 2024 freshman class you'll find the surprising note of only one five-star recruit. In fact, 28 of this years' freshmen are four stars, followed by 11 at three stars. Lanning and crew understand how to budget their recruiting tactics to garner the talent they need for what they have now.\n\nThis 2024 season boasts a roster of an above average 25 seniors and 20 juniors. With talented depth in the offense, there's a chance not many freshmen will make an immediate impact in their first season and develop.

Four starters are back for Oregon this season, along with Indiana transfer Matthew Bedford, which should certainly help veteran quarterback Dillon Gabriel. Ducks' Offensive line Coach A'Lique Terry and Strength & Conditioning Coach Wilson Love have developed an experienced unit who should compete in the upper echelon of the Big Ten, in year one.\n\nIn the Trenches - Meet Our Projected StartersLT Josh Conerly Jr6'4 305 lbs\n\nConerly received only an all-conference honorable mention in the Pac 12 last season. He is considered one of the best natural athletes and pass blockers in the class of 2025. His foot speed is impressive, and he plays with a strong base, displaying great fluidity in lateral movement. Conerly excels at reaching defenders outside and climbing to the second level, beating defenders to the spot and has great field vision. With a strong lower body and excellent footwork he is among the top prospects in next year's offensive line draft class.\n\nRT: Ajani Cornelius 6'5 310 lbs\n\nCornelius, who transferred from Rhode Island, has improved each season and consistently demonstrates his athleticism. He excels in pass protection, and his agility is evident in his smooth lateral movement. In the 2023 season, Cornelius allowed zero sacks and just 11 total pressures in 512 pass-blocking snaps. He is aggressive and has a tenacious attitude when finishing blocks.\n\nLG: Marcus Harper II6'3 325 lbs\n\nStarted all 14 games last year at left guard for Oregon. Harper is a fifth-year senior with the Ducks. He is a solid run blocker with a mean streak. He utilizes his strong lower body well, enabling him to pack a strong punch into the defender's chest.\n\nC: lapani Laloulu 6'2 325 lbs\n\nIn 2023, as a true freshman, he played in all 14 games for the Ducks, taking on roles at right guard, left guard, and center. He allowed zero sacks and two QB pressures throughout 413 total offensive snaps. His first career start at center was in the Fiesta Bowl against Liberty.\n\nRG: Matthew Bedford 6'6 305 lbs\n\nBedford was a three-year starter at Indiana, before transferring to Eugene. Being on an Oregon team with plenty of playmakers, experienced offensive line, and a solid offensive identity will help Bedford excel in 2024.

According to Pro Football Focus, the top five teams are Oregon, Ole Miss, Ohio State, Georgia and Texas.\n\nFormer Georgia Bulldog standout and ex-ESPN College GameDay host David Pollack hinted at his opinion on the discussion. He tweeted that Evan Stewart and Tez Johnson are a \"freakish duo\" for the Oregon Ducks.\n\nAccording to PFF, the duo was the only pair to place fourth and ninth in the top 10 of their wide receiver rankings for next season. Johnson led all Power Five receivers last season with 727 yards after the catch. Although Stewart missed five games in 2023 due to a leg injury, the former top-10 overall recruit was second among FBS true freshmen in 2022 with 643 receiving yards.\n\nThe two receivers will have one of the most prolific passers in college football history throwing them the football. The Ducks have added Oklahoma transfer Dillon Gabriel, ranked No. 8 all-time in college football history in passing yards and touchdowns.\n\nWhile Johnson and Stewart receive a lot of attention, the Ducks also welcome back Traeshon Holden and Gary Bryant Jr., the third and fourth-leading receivers in terms of yards last year. Additionally, Oregon has added Jeremiah McClellan, a top 40 player in the 2024 class.\n\nWith all those additions, the Ducks could give defensive secondaries nightmares when they come to town in 2024.\n\nRelated: David Pollack Names The Best Running Back Room In College Football", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri":

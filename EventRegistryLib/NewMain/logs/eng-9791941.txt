The incident took place at the Haggin Oaks Golf Complex at around 1:18 p.m., as confirmed by the Sacramento Fire Department.\n\nThe small plane, identified as a single-engine Piper PA28, came to a stop near the pro shop, narrowly missing hitting anyone, as shown in surveillance video footage. The pilot reported experiencing mechanical failure and power loss at an altitude of about 400 feet. He made the decision to land on the fairway of the golf course to safely bring the plane down.\n\nFortunately, the pilot managed to walk away from the crash with only a minor laceration on his hand. Sacramento Fire Department spokesperson Capt. Justin Sylvia praised the pilot's choice of landing location, stating that it was fortunate that no one, including the pilot, was seriously injured in the incident.\n\nEmergency responders took the pilot to a hospital for evaluation after he reported not feeling well about 45 minutes after the crash. Thankfully, there were no other injuries reported. Although the plane was leaking fuel, there was no fire.\n\nWitnesses at the golf course described the crash as a shocking and unprecedented event. Golfer Tim Cowan mentioned hearing a loud noise before seeing the aftermath of the crash. Golf course employee Charlie Lewis also expressed astonishment at the scene, describing it as unlike anything he had ever witnessed before.\n\nThe plane came to a halt next to the pro shop after sliding across a practice putting green. Fortunately, the damage to the facility was minor, according to a statement from Haggin Oaks Golf Complex on Facebook. The restaurant and pro shop were closed for the remainder of the day, but the Golf Super Shop and driving range remained open.\n\nBoth the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are conducting investigations into the crash to determine the cause of the incident. The swift and professional response of the first responders from the fire department and law enforcement was commended by the golf course management.\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder of the importance of quick thinking and proper emergency procedures in the event of unexpected situations like a plane crash. It also highlights the resilience and courage of the pilot who managed to safely land the aircraft in a challenging situation.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Fire_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Fire Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-28_Cherokee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piper PA-28 Cherokee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First responder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fire department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation accidents and incidents"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Aircraft", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Aircraft", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://usanews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/news-06082024-002330.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791941", "eventUri": "eng-9791941", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

(KCRA) - The pilot of a small plane was forced to make an emergency landing on a California golf course after the plane's engine failed shortly after takeoff.\n\nTim Colin was among those golfing Sunday afternoon at Haggin Oaks Golf Complex in Sacramento, California, when a plane made an emergency landing on the course.\n\n\"We were on the 16th hole when this happened. Our group heard the loud crash, but we had no idea it was a plane,\" Colin said\n\nDramatic surveillance video shows the plane making a belly landing. It skids quickly across a practice green, narrowly avoiding hitting a golfer.\n\nThe plane came to a stop resting against the Haggin Oaks' pro shop, according to Ken Morton Jr., the vice president of Morton Golf, which operates the golf course.\n\n\"Literally 10 feet to the right, it would have gone through our glass door, straight into the pro shop,\" Morton said. \"I have lots of staff, lots of customers in there, and it would have been really disastrous. The fact it ended up with everyone being OK is really a miracle.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration says the single engine Piper PA-28 had just taken off from McClellan Airfield, which is less than 5 miles away, when the plane's engine failed. At about 400 feet altitude, the pilot had to find a safe place to make an emergency landing.\n\n\"Luckily, there was a golf course nearby where he could lay it down,\" said Capt. Justin Sylvia with the Sacramento Fire Department. \"Nobody was injured. Surprisingly, the pilot was able to get out of the aircraft with just a small laceration to his hand.\"\n\nGolfers like Fred Robertson are grateful everyone is OK.\n\n\"Definitely counting my blessings,\" Robertson said. \"I usually putt right on that putting green... but just by chance, something told me to hold off before I got here. Sure enough. It isn't too often planes fall out of the sky.\"\n\nThe FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are both investigating the incident.", "source": {"uri": "fox10tv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX10 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emergency landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belly_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belly landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Fire_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Fire Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_McClellan_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento McClellan Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-28_Cherokee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piper PA-28 Cherokee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Altitude"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Aircraft", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Aircraft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Aircraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Aircraft", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://gray-wala-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/5NC2ILUY5RGZBOSWZZRFMNHLQA.jpg?auth=a2a82de79075332138c41dde86aa9fc250036f91957b7f4443bdf9398b1a9e4c&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791941", "eventUri": "eng-9791941", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

'Our group heard the loud crash, but we had no idea it was a plane.'\n\nThe single-engine Piper PA-28 experienced an engine failure while taking off from the privately owned McClellan airport and dropped 400 feet form the air, according to aviation officials.\n\n'Luckily, there was a golf course nearby where he could lay it down,' said Sacramento Fire Department Capt Justin Sylvia.\n\nThe aircraft halted just before the Haggin Oaks pro shop.\n\n'Literally 10 feet to the right, it would have gone through our glass door, straight into the pro shop,' Morton Golf vice president Ken Morton Jr told KCRA.\n\n'I have lots of staff, lots of customers in there, and it would have been really disastrous. The fact it ended up with everyone being OK is really a miracle.'\n\nThe pilot was also lucky, and walked away shaken with just a small laceration on his hand.\n\n'This is something we don't see very often,' Sylvia told CBS News. 'The remarkable thing about this situation is no one was injured.'\n\nThe crash is being investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\nEthan Sison, who was golfing on another side of the course, said he saw helicopters and an ambulance.\n\n'I saw the skid marks and I was like, \"What is that?\" I thought it was a car at first,' he told the news outlet.\n\nAnother golfer, Fred Robertson, was grateful no one was hurt.\n\n'Definitely counting my blessings,' Robertson told KCRA.\n\n'I usually putt right on that putting green... but just by chance, something told me to hold off before I got here. Sure enough. It isn't too often planes fall out of the sky.'\n\nThe frightening incident happened just a couple weeks after CCTV footage recorded the moment a small plane crash landed in the front yard of a home in northern Utah. The homeowner was fortunate that the aircraft stopped short of the house.\n\nMORE : Kamala Harris picks Minnesota governor Tim Walz to be her running mate\n\nMORE : Man spent 20 years on the run from police with a very surprising career", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_kwong@metro.co.uk", "name": "Jessica Kwong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belly_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belly landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCRA-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KCRA-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation accidents and incidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Fire_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Fire Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-28_Cherokee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piper PA-28 Cherokee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Aircraft", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Aircraft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SEC_216155744-8545.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C38px%2C960px%2C504px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791941", "eventUri": "eng-9791941", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

CCTV video shows plane narrowly missing golfer before skidding to a stop. Piper PA-28 Cherokee is a popular light aircraft with over 32,000 produced since 1961.\n\nOn Monday, August 5th, KCRA reported that a small single-engine aircraft reportedly conducted an emergency landing at a golf course in Sacramento, California. The aircraft, which was a Piper PA-28 Cherokee, suffered an engine failure, and the pilot was forced to land at a nearby golf course because he believed that he would be unable to make it to the nearby airport. The aircraft successfully crash-landed at Haggin Oaks Golf Course Complex in Sacramento. The pilot walked away from the incident with minor injuries, reporting that he suffered only a minor cut to his hand.\n\nEmergency landing at a golf course\n\nAs seen in the CCTV video above, the pilot crashed into an open area of the golf course, narrowly missing another golfer on the ground. Per the Sacramento Fire Department, the pilot had taken off from McClellan Airfield (MCC), which is about six miles northeast of Sacramento. The airfield is also just north of Haggins Oaks Golf Complex. According to officials, after taking off, the pilot experienced complete mechanical engine failure. At the time, he was only at an altitude of 400 feet.\n\nPhoto: Igor Grochev | Shutterstock\n\nThe aircraft allegedly flew over the first hole right before turning sharply to the right. Ken Morton Jr., the Vice President of Haggins Oaks Golf Complex, told ABC10 that the plane landed on the tenth-hole tee box and skidded over the putting green.\n\nAs seen in the video, the plane skidded around 50 yards before coming to a stop. This prevented damage to the pro shop, which is the building seen in the video. Debris was scattered across the ground, including part of the wing and part of the landing gear.\n\nAbout the Piper PA-28 Cherokee\n\nAs previously mentioned, the aircraft that crashed into the golf course was a Piper PA-28 Cherokee. Piper has been building this light aircraft since 1961. Since its introduction, over 32,000 Cherokees have been produced, making it one of the most-produced aircraft series in the world. The PA-28 family also includes the Warrior series, the Archer series, and the Arrow series.\n\nPhoto: Photosite/Shutterstock\n\nThe Cherokee is a civil utility aircraft that typically holds up to four people.

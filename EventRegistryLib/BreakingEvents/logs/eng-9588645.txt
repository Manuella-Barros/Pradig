Vijay Mallya also extended his wishes for Royal Challengers Bengaluru's success in their upcoming match in the playoffs.\n\nVijay Mallya bought the Royal Challengers Bengaluru franchise for $111.6 million before the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League in 2008. This acquisition was the second-highest bid, with Reliance Industries securing the highest bid of $111.9 million for the Mumbai Indians (MI) franchise.\n\nVijay Mallya was the owner of Royal Challengers Sports Pvt Ltd (RCSPL), the parent company of RCB. However, Mallya relinquished his role as the primary owner of the RCB franchise when he stepped down as the director of RCSPL in 2016. United Spirits Limited, a Diageo Group company, owns RCB.\n\nVijay Mallya stated that he could not have made a better choice almost 17 years ago when he acquired the RCB franchise and bid for Virat Kohli. Mallya highlighted that RCB has the best chance of winning the IPL trophy this year.\n\n\"When I bid for the RCB franchise and I bid for Virat, my inner instinct told me that I could not have made better choices. My inner instinct tells me that RCB have the best chance to go for the IPL Trophy. Onward and Upward. Best of luck,\" Mallaya posted on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nVirat Kohli has been with RCB since the IPL's inception in 2008. He has emerged as their most valuable player. He holds the record for the most runs scored in IPL history. Kohli led RCB to the final in 2016, where he scored 973 runs. However, the Bengaluru team failed to clinch the title in 2016.\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru are just a few wins away from securing a spot in the IPL 2024 final. They were on the brink of elimination a month ago after enduring six consecutive defeats. However, they bounced back from the bottom of the standings to secure a top-four finish in the tournament.\n\nThe Faf du Plessis-led team secured six consecutive victories to secure a playoff berth.

Photograph: BCCI\n\nFormer Royal Challengers Bengaluru owner Vijay Mallya says he couldn't have made a better choice than Virat Kohli when he bought the Delhi batter ahead of the inaugural edition of the IPL in 2008.\n\nRCB have made a stunning comeback to reach the IPL 2024 play-offs. They were on the brink of elimination after winning just one of their first eight games, including six defeats in a row, but left everyone shocked with six straight victories to qualify for the play-offs.\n\nKohli has been instrumental in RCB's revival with 708 runs from 14 games at a strike rate of 155, with five fifties and one century.\n\nMallya remembered how he went to bag a young Kohli, who had led India to the Under-19 World Cup title, for his franchise RCB for $30,000 from the Under-19 draft in 2008.\n\nKohli is the only player to have played 16 seasons for a single team. He is the highest run-getter in IPL history with 7,971 runs from 251 games with eight centuries and 55 fifties.\n\n'When I bid for the RCB franchise and I bid for Virat, my inner instinct told me that I could not have made better choices. My inner instinct tells me that RCB have the best chance to go for the IPL Trophy. Onward and Upward.

RCB, then co-owned by Vijay Mallya, was bought Virat Kohli for a price of $30,000 in 2008 and since then the batsman has stayed on with the franchise, guiding them to IPL final thrice - in 2009, 2011 and 2016. Ahead of RR match, Mallya sent across his best wishes for the team.\n\nVijay Mallya expressed confidence in his decisions regarding the acquisition of the RCB franchise and Virat Kohli. He believes that his intuition guided him to make the right choices, indicating that RCB stands a strong chance of clinching the IPL Trophy.\n\n\"When I bid for the RCB franchise and I bid for Virat, my inner instinct told me that I could not have made better choices. My inner instinct tells me that RCB have the best chance to go for the IPL Trophy. Onward and Upward. Best of luck,\" Mallya posted on X. Royal Challengers Bangalore, also known as RCB, is now owned by United Spirits Limited, a Diageo Group company.\n\nVirat Kohli's exceptional performance in the IPL has cemented his status as one of cricket's most prolific batsmen. Former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden is optimistic about Virat Kohli's performance in the IPL playoffs. Kohli, who has been in exceptional form throughout the league stage, has the opportunity to surpass his previous record for the highest number of runs scored in a single IPL season. Currently, Kohli has accumulated 708 runs in 14 matches, marking the second-best season of his IPL career. His outstanding form in the ongoing season, which includes five half-centuries and one century, places him in contention to exceed his previous record of 973 runs achieved in the 2016 season. Despite being 265 runs shy of his personal best, Kohli remains the leading run-scorer of the season, earning the prestigious Orange Cap.\n\nKohli's journey in cricket began with his captaincy of the Indian team during the 2008 ICC U19 Cricket World Cup, and since then, he has continuously evolved as a player and leader. His association with RCB dates back to 2008 when he joined the franchise, eventually assuming the captaincy in 2013. In 2016, he topped the list of leading run-scorers in the IPL, earning the coveted Orange Cap. Kohli's significance to RCB was further highlighted by his retention as the franchise's first choice ahead of the IPL 2018 Player Auction, making him the highest-paid cricketer in the league at that time.\n\nLater, Kohli announced his decision to step down as captain of RCB. Despite this, he assured fans of his unwavering commitment to the franchise, emphasizing his loyalty as a player. Throughout his tenure as captain, Kohli led RCB in 140 matches, winning 66 and losing 70. His leadership style, characterized by aggression and a strong presence on the field, has left a lasting impact on the team and its supporters. In 251 IPL matches, Kohli has scored close to 8,000 runs at an average of 38.69 and strike rate of 131.9.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_Mallya", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vijay Mallya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Spirits", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Spirits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Hayden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diageo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diageo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-110328183,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-61006,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588645", "eventUri": "eng-9588645", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Mallya took to social media on the day of RCB's Indian Premier League Eliminator against RR and said that his instinct told him that RCB might win the title this season. The former owner also said that when RCB bid for Virat Kohli in the player drafts of the inaugural season of the tournament - he knew that it was the right call to make. Mallya, who currently lives in the United Kingdom and is trying to avoid extradition from the Indian government.\n\nThe RCB are on a fairytale run in the Indian Premier League and have reached the playoffs on the back of a 6-match winning run. RCB were down and out after losing the first 7 games from 8 matches and have been on a sensational run ever since.\n\n\"When I bid for the RCB franchise and I bid for Virat, my inner instinct told me that I could not have made better choices. My inner instinct tells me that RCB have the best chance to go for the IPL Trophy. Onward and Upward. Best of luck.\n\nVijay Mallya, once celebrated as the \"King of Good Times,\" epitomises both the heights of corporate success and the depths of financial disgrace. Born on December 18, 1955, into a wealthy family in Karnataka, India, Mallya inherited United Breweries Group from his father, Vittal Mallya, at the young age of 28. He expanded the company into a massive conglomerate that spanned various sectors including beverages, aviation, and real estate.\n\nThe cornerstone of Mallya's empire was Kingfisher beer, which enjoyed nationwide popularity and significant international presence. Mallya's flair wasn't just limited to business; he was also a politician, having served as a Member of Parliament. His flamboyant lifestyle, luxurious parties, and associations with high-profile personalities made him a brand unto himself.\n\nHowever, Mallya's ambitions got the better of him. In 2005, he launched Kingfisher Airlines, an endeavor that initially gained a lot of attention for its luxury, but turned out to be financially disastrous. The airline accumulated massive debts, leading to its eventual collapse in 2012. Employees went unpaid, and the company defaulted on loans, leading to a colossal financial fiasco.\n\nThe repercussions were severe. Indian banks claimed that Mallya and his companies owed more than Rs 9,000 crore (approximately $1.4 billion). Mallya left India in 2016, and has since been embroiled in multiple legal battles to evade extradition to India, where he faces charges of financial fraud and money laundering.\n\nDespite these controversies, Mallya maintains that he is not a fugitive, insisting that he intends to repay the dues. The Indian government, on the other hand, has been relentless in its efforts to bring him back to face trial. In 2020, the UK High Court ruled in favor of his extradition, but Mallya has managed to delay the process through legal appeals and other maneuvers.\n\nMallya's downfall is a cautionary tale of how unchecked ambition and financial mismanagement can lead to a precipitous decline. Although he once symbolized entrepreneurial prowess and luxury, he now stands as a stark reminder of the perils of financial indiscretion. His story is not just a personal tragedy but also a significant event in the annals of Indian corporate history.\n\nAs of now, Vijay Mallya remains in the UK, continuing his legal strategies to avoid extradition. His legacy, however, is forever tarnished, serving as a grim example of how fortunes can reverse dramatically, turning the \"King of Good Times\" into a symbol of corporate scandal and accountability.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_Mallya", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vijay Mallya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholic drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittal_Mallya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vittal Mallya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingfisher_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingfisher Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Breweries_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Breweries Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingfisher_(beer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingfisher (beer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fugitive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/virat-kohli-202923440-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=z9yfmzBVhvG_XKMf8louiSxplfe3KDsM", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588645", "eventUri": "eng-9588645", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-12-", "textStart": 1253, "textEnd": 1264}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

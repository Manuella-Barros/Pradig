Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a sex scandal, a verdict was being delivered on The National Enquirer. The no-holds-barred supermarket tabloid was once famous for publishing salacious stories about celebrities and politicians. Now it may be better known for suppressing them. \u201cIt\u2019s just a tragedy for the paper,\u201d said Barry Levine, the publication\u2019s former executive editor, sitting in the living room of his one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan on a recent morning. Was he being overly dramatic? Perhaps. Even among those who consider it a guilty pleasure, The Enquirer can hardly be described as a national treasure. But try telling that to Mr. Levine, a swashbuckling journalist who worked there from 1999 until 2016 and whose professional and personal identity was shaped by it.", "summary": "For Barry Levine, a former top journalist at the supermarket tabloid, the former president\u2019s trial was its own kind of tear-jerker.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/02/style/national-enquirer-journalist-trump-conviction.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/01/multimedia/01BARRY-LEVINE-ENQUIRER-lkcb/01BARRY-LEVINE-ENQUIRER-lkcb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:18:01", "author": "Jacob Bernstein", "authors": ["Jacob Bernstein"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.165}

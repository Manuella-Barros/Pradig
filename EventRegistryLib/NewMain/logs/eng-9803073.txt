However, Chang used her double jab to open up, and Akbas began to pay dividends for her powerful left.\n\nChang began to throw more punches in bunches in the second round to secure consecutive rounds. Once again, Chang expertly used her jab to slice through Akbas's defense for her sharp inside boxing. The Turk struggled to cope with the pressure, resorting to clinches to try and halt Chang's momentum.\n\nIn the third bout, it was more of the same, as Chang began to increase her volume and expose the gulf in class between the two. After her name was called as the winner, Chang was hoisted into the air by her coach as the Chinese contingent in the crowd celebrated with her.\n\nAfter falling in the quarterfinals in Tokyo, Chang had to change her mindset to achieve gold.\n\n\"After the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, my mindset changed significantly. I became less impatient and restless. Recently, while preparing for Paris, I've managed to control my mindset and emotions well. This competition might help me gain a deeper understanding of myself. There are probably still many areas where I need to make changes,\" Chang admitted.\n\nALSO READ: Olympics: Yang settles for silver as boxing finals move to home of French tennis\n\n\"I'm very excited. From the regret of the Tokyo Olympics to winning China's first gold in women's boxing today, it's a huge moment for me.

I feel very proud and honored.\"\n\nIn a women's 75kg semifinal, China's Li Qian came from a round down against Australia's Caitlin Parker to win by unanimous decision. The Chinese started slow and allowed Parker to get inside her range and score big in the first round. However, Li came back with a vengeance in the second round as she started to land from the outside and used her footwork and head movement to avoid the Australian's counterpunches. Li continued her momentum through the third round and maintained her superior accuracy to book her place in the gold medal bout.\n\n\"In the second and third rounds, I was more proactive. The first round was pretty even, but I was behind 5-0. So, I focused on being more aggressive, increasing my attacks, and putting more pressure on my opponent,\" Li reflected on the first round.\n\nLi will face Panama's Atheyna Bylon in the final, after she defeated Cindy Winner Djankeu Ngamba of the Olympic Refugee team in a split decision 4-1.\n\nIn the men's 51kg final, Hasanboy Dusmatov won Uzbekistan's second boxing gold, beating France's Billal Bennama by unanimous decision. Backed by an ear drum-bursting rendition of La Marseillaise, the height difference between the two fighters was apparent, with the French No. 1 seed towering over his Uzbek foe.\n\nYet, it was Dusmatov who came out on top marginally on three of the judges' scorecards.

Despite a cautious start, Chang's tactical prowess shone through as she utilized her double jab to create openings, capitalizing on Akbas's powerful left hook.\n\nAs the match progressed, Chang's confidence soared, leading her to unleash a flurry of punches in the subsequent rounds, asserting her dominance and clinching consecutive rounds.

It is hard to associate her with the poker-faced boxer unleashing a storm of punches that secured China's first-ever Olympic gold in women's boxing.\n\nOn Thursday night, the atmosphere was electric at Roland Garros as Chang stepped into the ring in the Paris Olympics women's 54kg final. Although seven centimeters shorter than her opponent, Turkiye's rising star Hatice Akbas, Chang kept the bout under control with agility and decisive strikes. In the final 20 seconds of the first round, Chang cornered Akbas with a relentless barrage, claiming an early victory in the round.\n\nIn the second round, Chang dominated the center of the ring, skillfully blocking her opponent's attempts to escape. As the third round began, Chang's fists flew with even greater ferocity, leaving Akbas struggling to keep up. When the final bell rang, there was no doubt who had won.\n\nFor the 27-year-old Chang, this victory was more than just a medal - it was the culmination of years of perseverance and unfulfilled dreams.\n\nAt Tokyo 2020, she had walked away with disappointment in the second round. This time, when the referee announced her as the winner, she jumped into the air, fists raised in triumph, before rushing to embrace her coach, who lifted her high above the ring in celebration.\n\nAs the Chinese flag rose and the national anthem resonated through the arena, tears welled up in Chang's eyes. This was a moment 12 years in the making for Team China after women's boxing was first introduced at the 2012 London Olympics. And For Chang, it was the realization of a 15-year dream.\n\n\"From the regret in Tokyo to winning China's first women's boxing gold, I'm overwhelmed with excitement,\" Chang said later. \"Tennis player Zheng Qinwen made history and had our flag raising at Roland Garros, and now I've done the same. I'm so proud of myself.\"\n\nChang's path to the top was anything but straightforward. Growing up in a martial arts family - her grandfather and father both practiced martial arts - Chang was naturally drawn to the sport. She started with martial arts and later switched to taekwondo. Then, in 2009, when her home province of Hebei formed a women's boxing team in preparation for the London Olympics, she was intrigued. \"I thought the boxers looked so cool,\" she recalled, and decided to make the switch.\n\nTo outsiders, boxing might seem brutal, but to Chang, it's a game of strategy and intellect. \"In this game, I have to hit my opponent while avoiding being hit. It looks intense, but it's really a battle of wits and speed,\" she explained.\n\nChang's fierce and fearless style quickly brought her success. She won gold at the Nanjing Youth Olympics and the Jakarta Asian Games in 2018, but over time, she realized that raw aggression was not enough.\n\n\"Being too confident and aggressive can backfire. After my loss in Tokyo, I learned to control my emotions and mindset better. This win in Paris might help me see that there's still more I need to change about myself,\" she said, reflecting on her journey.\n\nWith her Olympic gold, Chang has made history, but she is quick to share the credit. \"I want to dedicate this medal to my parents, my team, the national squad, the Hebei team, and everyone who supports Chinese boxing,\" she said with emotion.\n\nFor Chang, the past three years of grueling training - days that felt like \"peeling a layer off my skin\" - are now a distant memory. This victory has given her great strength. \"I hope I can stand on the Olympic boxing ring again,\" she said.\n\nChang's triumph in Paris is not just a personal victory; it will be a beacon of hope for the future of Chinese women's boxing. It is a story of perseverance, resilience, and the power of dreams - an inspiration for generations to come. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yuan dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_Qinwen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zheng Qinwen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Organising_Committee_of_the_Olympic_and_Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanda_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanda (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asian Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provinces of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Youth Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taekwondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebei", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hebei"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hebei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nanjing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nanjing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jakarta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jakarta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803073", "eventUri": "eng-9803073", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

The men's flyweight and women's bantamweight gold medals were awarded. Additionally, the finals are scheduled for the women's 75kgs and men's featherweight competitions.\n\nDusmatov secures second Olympic gold\n\nUzbekistan's Hasanboy Dusmatov won his second Olympic gold medal in the men's flyweight competition, by defeating Billal Bennama of France and disappointing the local crowd. Bennama, who was knocked out by Dusmatov in 2023, fared better in Paris but still lost a three-round decision. Dusmatov, a 31-year-old professional boxer, previously won gold at Rio 2016, sparking further debate over the inclusion of professional boxers at the Games.\n\nYuan Chang becomes China's first female boxing gold medalist\n\nChina's Yuan Chang made history by becoming her country's first female Olympic gold medalist in boxing, when winning the women's bantamweight title. Chang defeated Turkey's Hatice Akbas by counter-punching effectively to nullify Akbas, who had been the divisional favorite.\n\nControversial decision costs Ngamba spot in the final\n\nCindy Ngamba, representing the Olympics Refugee Team and training with Team Great Britain, was controversially denied a place in the women's 75kgs final. Questionable scoring led to Panama's Atheyna Bylon advancing instead. Ngamba's feel-good story ended in frustration - an all-too-common occurrence in Olympics boxing. Bylon will face China's Li Qian, who outpointed Australia's Caitlin Parker in a lackluster semi-final, in the final.\n\nFeatherweight final set - with a surprise contender\n\nKyrgyzstan's Munarbek Seitbek Uulu continued his surprising Olympics run by defeating the tournament favorite Javier Ibanez to reach the men's featherweight final.

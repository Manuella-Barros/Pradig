In a contest that featured 11 total pitchers, the two clubs combined to score 20 runs on 27 hits in the Bees' 11-9 victory.\n\nSalt Lake overcame multiple deficits, thanks to a seven-run second inning and a four-run seventh. It was in the later frame that the Bees took the lead for good on a Sherman Johnson RBI single.\n\n\"The one thing our club has done, since the beginning of the year, which has helped us into first place in the division, is they pass the baton,\" said Bees manager Keith Johnson. \"In both (the second and seventh) innings we just kept hitting the ball up the middle. They just took what was given to them. It was good to see our guys play a little free again. They just went out and played baseball.\"\n\nAll but one Bee, Michael Hermosillo, found their way into the hit column, led by Eric Young Jr. and Carlos Perez, with three hits apiece. David Fletcher was excellent as well, driving in three RBIs and scoring the game-winning run.\n\nWEST ORANGE WARRIOR: Nolan Fontana had himself a night, at least as far as the long ball is concerned. The Florida Gator drilled a homer to right field, his 10th blast of the season, to start the Bees' explosive second inning. With 10 homers, Fontana moves into third place on the Bees roster, trailing only Cesar Puello and Kaleb Cowart, both of whom are currently with the Angels.\n\nThe homer continued a Salt Lake streak of long ball usage, a rarity when its comes to the small ball centric Bees. With 89 homers this season, the Bees are the worst home run hitting team in the PCL, and yet the club has hit a homer in each of the past six games.\n\nBULLPEN BARRAGE: It was bullpen night at Smith's Ballpark, which meant a veritable platoon of relief pitchers toed the rubber for the Bees. Drew Gagnon got the start, his 10th this season. Things did not go swimmingly for the big righty to start the contest, as he walked three consecutive Rainiers in the top of the first inning. One of those free passes gifted Taylor Motter and Tacoma a run. He eventually settled down, and pitched three total innings, giving up three runs on three hits.\n\nGagnon was succeeded by Adam Hofacket, who did not give a good impression of himself either. The reliever gave up three runs and four hits in a little over an inning. Jose Alvarez, Manny Banuelos, Luis Diaz and Jason Gurka each had a turn on the mound, with the foursome providing just enough pitching to help the Bees eek out the victory.\n\nTACOMA TURNSTILE: With their major league affiliate, the Seattle Mariners, locked in the race for one of the American League's two wildcard spots, the Rainiers were given a mandate of sorts. No Tacoma pitcher would pitch more than 50 pitches, give or take a few, from now until the end of the season. The strategy, implemented to create long-outing relief pitchers, was in full effect Thursday.\n\nThe Rainiers sent out five hurlers, starting with Tyler Cloyd. Most of the relievers performed their job to perfection, save for Cloyd and Ernesto Frieri, who gave up 10 of the 11 Bees runs.\n\n******\n\nBEELINES\n\nBees -- 11\n\nRainiers -- 9\n\nIn short: The Bees scored 11 runs (in just two innings) on 15 hits in late-season victory.\n\nRecord: 64-61\n\nUp next: Tacoma TBA at Salt Lake, Daniel Wright (6-8, 7.25 ERA), Friday, 6:35 p.m.\n\nEMAIL:

Luis Diaz, who was called on in the eighth inning, allowed no runs and no hits, striking out one.\n\nIn the bottom of the seventh inning, with the Bees up by two, Salt Lake broke open the game with three runs in the inning, with all of the Bees' runs coming off of Tacoma pitcher Shae Simmons, who pitched to five batters and produced no outs before being sent to the dugout by Rainiers manager Pat Listach.\n\n\"There was a lot of guys that contributed tonight and our pitching did a great job keeping us in it all the way through.

Salt Lake won games two and four, 3-1 and 8-2, respectively, and lost games one and three, 3-5 and 3-5. Meanwhile, the Albuquerque Isotopes, who are hot on the Bees' heels for the lead in the Pacific Southern Division, split its series with the Fresno Grizzlies.

The Rainiers come into Smith's Ballpark with a 61-61 record, eight games behind PCL American Southern Division leaders Fresno and Reno.\n\nHOME RUN HAPPY: The Bees have homered in eight of their 14 games in August and have gone yard in four straight games.

His score, on a Ramon Flores single, gave the Bees a one run lead and eventually the 3-2 victory.\n\nHermosillo was excellent all night, but it was his effort in the seventh that decided the game. He drew a leadoff walk, and later in the inning, when Flores hit a single to shallow center field, the young outfielder put on the boosters, sprinting his way from first base to home for the go ahead score.\n\n\"I was rounding second (base) and (Bees manager Keith Johnson) was saying 'Come on, come on!!',\" said Hermosillo. \"I kind of put my head down as I rounded third, and missed him telling me to stop. I was just full go. It was crazy scoring on a single up the middle.\"\n\nIt wasn't all Hermosillo, as the Bees received an excellent outing from starting pitcher John Lamb. The southpaw pitched seven-plus innings, holding the Rainiers to just two runs on eight hits.\n\nHis effort, as well as that of relievers Brooks Pounders and Deolis Guerra, made Hermosillo's game changing play ultimately matter.\n\nHEAVY HITTER: Hermosillo has been on quite the tear of late. In fact, since going hitless in his first two Triple-A contests, the Bees outfielder has been lights out. Hermosillo has recorded a hit in each of his last 11 contests, including a multi-hit night Tuesday. Wednesday was just more of the same.\n\n\"I just tried to stay with it, even when things weren't going well,\" said Hermosillo. \"Things just weren't falling for me early on but I stayed in the cage. I changed a couple things, I moved my hands a little higher (on the bat) and changed my rhythmn a little, but mostly I just stuck with it.\"\n\nTAKE A LOOK, IT'S IN A BOOK: Deseret News Read with the Bees Night was the major off-the-field event Wednesday night. The celebration was the conclusion of the Bees Summer Reading Challenge, an effort by Deseret News, KSL, the Bees, the Utah State Library Division and Seagull Books designed to encourage summer reading by elementary school students.\n\nOver 4,000 children successfully completed the challenge, and as a result were gifted free tickets to the Bees game.\n\nPLAYOFF PICTURE: Entering their most recent contest, the Bees held a slim one and a half game lead over the Albuquerque Isotopes for first place in the Pacific Southern division. In Triple-A baseball, only the division winners advance to the playoffs. The race for the top of the Pacific Southern division seems destined to go down to the very end of the season, as Salt Lake, Albuquerque and the El Paso Chihuahuas are all within two games of one another. At least that was before the Bees took down the visiting Rainiers and the Chihuahuas defeated the Isotopes.\n\nThanks to Wednesday night's victory, coupled with Albuquerque's loss to El Paso, the Bees now hold a two-game edge in the division.\n\nBEELINES\n\nBees - 3\n\nRainiers - 2\n\nIn short: Michael Hermosillo hit a homer, and scored all three Bees runs in the victory.\n\nRecord: 63-61\n\nUp Next: Tacoma RHP Ernesto Frieri (1-0, 0.00) at Salt Lake RHP Luis Diaz (4-11, 5.68), Thursday, 7:05 p.m.\n\nEMAIL: twood@deseretnews.com", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "wgt": 100, "id": 52, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "wgt": 100, "id": 93, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "wgt": 100, "id": 222, "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hermosillo"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermosillo", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hermosillo"}, "type": "loc", "id": "178331"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Albuquerque"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Albuquerque"}, "type": "loc", "id": "230609"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "El Paso"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paso,_Texas", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Paso"}, "type": "loc", "id": "231263"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "type": "loc", "id": "231788"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "234799"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303564", "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303571", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303714", "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305788", "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305861", "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310511", "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Rainiers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310514", "label": {"eng": "Tacoma Rainiers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deseret_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "333902", "label": {"eng": "Deseret News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paso_Chihuahuas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "382035", "label": {"eng": "El Paso Chihuahuas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque_Isotopes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "434189", "label": {"eng": "Albuquerque Isotopes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deolis_Guerra", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555892", "label": {"eng": "Deolis Guerra"}}]}

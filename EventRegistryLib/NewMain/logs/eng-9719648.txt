Philippines -- The country's manufacturing output posted a slower growth in May due to the decline in the production of metal products, chemicals and computer products, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).\n\nPreliminary results of the PSA's Monthly Integrated Survey of Selected Industries released yesterday showed that the Volume of Production Index (VoPI) registered a 3.2-percent growth in May, lower than the 6.3-percent increase in April and the 6.1-percent expansion in May 2023.\n\nThe PSA said the lower VoPI growth was primarily due to the slower increase in the three industry divisions.\n\nIn particular, the production of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment declined by 13.4 percent in May from the 29.9 percent increase in April.\n\nManufacture of chemical and chemical products also contracted by 11.7 percent in May, a reversal of the 16.6 percent growth in the previous month.\n\nProduction of computer, electronic and optical products also decreased by 0.3 percent in May from the 5.2 percent increase in April.\n\n\"Inflationary pressures, reflected by data from PSA, and the recent currency depreciation, indicated in BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) data, may have contributed to this, making the raw materials and work-in-progress costlier, especially those that are being imported,\" Philippine Institute for Development Studies senior research fellow John Paolo Rivera said in an email yesterday.\n\nInflation or the rate of increase in average prices of goods and services usually purchased by households eased to 3.7 percent in June, snapping a four-month uptrend amid slower increases in utility and transport costs.\n\nThe PSA said the average capacity utilization rate for manufacturing in May this year was reported at 75.5 percent, up from 75.3 percent in the previous month and 73.5 percent in May 2023.\n\n\"All industry divisions reported capacity utilization rates of more than 60 percent during the month,\" the PSA said.\n\nIndustry divisions with the highest reported capacity utilization rate in May were the manufacture of machinery and equipment except electrical (83.4 percent), manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products (82.1 percent) and manufacture of rubber and plastic products (81.2 percent).\n\nOf the total number of responding establishments, 28.1 percent operated at full capacity (90 to 100 percent) in May.\n\nMeanwhile, 42.4 percent were running at 70 to 89 percent capacity and 29.4 percent operated below 70 percent capacity.", "source": {"uri":

The figures are also lower than the 8.5-percent and 6.1-percent increases recorded in May last year.\n\nThe slower increase in VaPI, the PSA said, was due to deceleration in the annual growth rate of the manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products industry division, which grew 1.6 percent from 9.4 percent in the previous month.\n\nYear-to-date, however, VaPI remained negative at 0.1 percent, while VoPI remained positive with growth 0.9 percent.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I

the manufacturing section in May 2024,\" the PSA said.\n\nIt was also the second highest weight among 22 industry divisions in the computation of the VaPI, it added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwelve out of 19 industries declined during the month while seven posted annual increases, the PSA data showed.\n\nThe manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products posted the highest annual increment of 50.9 percent during the period.\n\nAs for the VoPI, May's slow increase was also due to the slower upward trend in the manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment, which registered 13.4 percent from a double-digit increase of 29.9 percent.\n\nTwelve of the remaining 19 divisions also posted a decline, while seven increased.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAverage capacity utilization, meanwhile, went slightly up to 75.5 percent from 75.3 percent in April.\n\n\"All industry divisions reported capacity utilization rates of more than 60.0 percent during the month,\" the PSA said.\n\nMore than a quarter -- 28.1 percent or 159 of the 566 establishments that participated in the PSA -- said they operated at full capacity, defined as 90 to 100 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, 42.4 percent (240 firms) said they operated at 70- to 89-percent capacity, while 29.4 percent (167 firms) reported operating below 70 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommenting on the results, Pantheon Macroeconomics economist Miguel Chanco mentioned that while they anticipated a significant drop, the actual outcome was still weaker than expected.\n\nThis result, he added, partially reflects the substantial reversal of favorable base effects that had previously driven the headline into negative territory in the last report.\n\n\"The 'growth' seen in April was never going to last, considering the abysmal trends at the margin,\" Chanco said. \"Base effects will again push the year-on-year rate into the black for the June report, but this should also be short-lived, given the weakness in momentum.\"\n\n\"Private consumption growth overall will remain under pressure from weak household balance sheets and high interest rates, while remittances are still not rising fast enough to provide any meaningful support, even if accounting for the recent lift in local currency terms, due to peso depreciation,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Japanese stocks ended sharply higher on Tuesday.\n\nMarket heavyweight SoftBank Group is gaining almost 1 percent and Uniqlo operator Fast Retailing is also adding almost 1 percent.

While the French CAC 40 Index tumbled by 1.6 percent, the German DAX Index slumped by 1.3 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index fell by 0.7 percent.\n\nCrude oil prices fell on Tuesday, extending losses to a third straight session, amid concerns about the outlook for demand, and on reports that Hurricane Beryl did not cause any big damage to refineries and ports along the Gulf coast.

compared to 27.4 percent seen in May, the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) announced on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the monthly headline inflation rate shifted from -0.8 percent in May to 1.8 percent in June.\n\nCAPMAS attributed the slowdown of the headline annual inflation mainly to the decline in prices of poultry and meat (by 3.7 percent), vegetables (by 2.3 percent), post services (by 4.3 percent), and cereal and bread (by 13.5 percent).\n\nMoreover, CAPMAS said the shift in the monthly inflation rate resulted from the increase in prices of vegetables and fruits (by three percent), clothes and shoes (by 1.2 percent), healthcare services (by 2.7 percent), and electricity; fuel; water (by 0.5 percent).\n\nCAPMAS' figures show a significant spike in prices of commodities and services in June 2024 compared to the same month of 2023.\n\nAccordingly, prices of food and vegetables jumped in June by 30.8 percent, transportation by 17.5 percent, electricity; fuel; water by 12.4 percent, clothes and shoes by 25.9 percent, and culture and entertainment services by 56.6 percent.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) is scheduled to convene on Thursday 18 July to review the key interest rates in the committee's first meeting in the current FY2024/2025, which started on 1 July, and the fourth in 2024.\n\nThe MPC decides on the key interest rates in light of the global and local macroeconomic development, especially the inflation rates, along with the performance of the local currency against the US dollar.\n\nSince January, the CBE has increased the key interest rates by eight percent (800 bps).\n\nIn its last meeting held in May, the CBE maintained the overnight deposit rate, the overnight lending rate, and the main operation rate at 27.25 percent, 28.25 percent, and 27.75 percent, respectively.\n\nThe CBE attributed its decision to the inflation reduction in the past few months.\n\nWith the new inflation figures announced, Egypt's headline inflation is still far beyond the targets the CBE has set at seven percent (\u00b12 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2024 and five percent (\u00b12 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\nContaining inflation and putting it on a downward path is one of the top priorities Egypt has committed to working on under its $8 billion loan programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nOn Tuesday, the IMF decided to reschedule its Executive Board's meeting on Egypt's third review under the loan programme to be held on 29 July instead of 10 July without giving more details.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629

Twenty-five percent of respondents said they thought the city was headed in the \"right direction,\" while 53 percent said it was headed down \"the wrong track.\"\n\nBut when asked the same question about their own neighborhoods, the respondents were notably more upbeat. Forty-six percent said their neighborhood was going in the right direction, while only 31 percent said it was on \"the wrong track.\"\n\nWhen asked whether they approved or disapproved the job being done by city government, only 4 percent said they strongly approved, while 19 percent said they strongly disapproved. When mushier gradations of sentiment were included in the equation, 39 percent somewhat or strongly approved, while 49 percent strongly or somewhat approved. Twelve percent did not know.\n\nThe survey was prepared by the polling firm FM3 to help guide the City Council in whether to put a half-cent sales-tax increase on the ballot this November in hopes of generating $15.6 million a year in additional revenues. Of the 220 people polled, 23 percent said they believed the city had \"a great need\" for additional revenues, while 15 percent said there was no real need.\n\nThirty-one percent said they would vote yes, and 21 percent said they probably would. By contrast, 22 percent reported they would vote against the measure, and 10 percent said they probably would vote against it.\n\nThe chief arguments in favor of the sales tax increase were that it would improve or maintain emergency services, help fund affordable housing, address homelessness, and improve library services. Respondents reported these arguments made them moderately more inclined -- from 26 to 36 percent -- to vote for the measure.\n\nBut when confronted with the argument that the sales tax increase was regressive and would add to their cost of living, 44 percent reported they were more inclined to vote against it. Of those, 20 percent said they were \"much more inclined.\"\n\nAfter all these questions, respondents were asked again how they would vote if the election were held that day. Twenty-nine percent said yes; 24 percent said no. Only after the \"probables\" and \"leaning\" were factored in, 53 percent reported supporting the measure; 38 were opposed.

The latest reading remained above 50 for a second straight quarter. Readings above 50 reflect more positive than negative responses to the survey upon which the index is based. But looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the reading was slightly lower at 49.9.\n\nAll six individual components of the index decreased between the second and third quarters, two of them to below neutral 50.\n\nThe business research division of the Leeds School of Business calculates the index based on the results of quarterly surveys of business leaders from across the state and industry sectors.\n\nOut of 201 leaders who responded to the third quarter survey in June, 150 offered open-ended explanations for their outlooks. While 26 percent of those who responded attributed their responses to higher interest rates, 21 percent cited uncertainty over the upcoming election and 17 percent their general sentiments.While 10 percent of respondents expressed optimism for the future, 7 percent expressed pessimism. Assessments of consumer confidence and demand were both positive and negative.\n\nExpectations for the Colorado economy fell 2.9 points to 51.2. Among the business leaders who responded to the third quarter survey, 31.8 percent expected a moderate increase in the economy. But 21.9 percent anticipated a decrease. Most leaders -- 40.8 percent -- predicted no change. At either end, 1.5 percent expected a strong increase and 4 percent a strong decrease.\n\nExpectations for the national economy fell 3.2 points to 46.8, the lowest reading among the six components of the index for the third quarter. While 25.4 percent of business leaders anticipated moderate or strong increases in the national economy, 35.8 percent expected moderate or strong decreases. Most leaders -- 38.8 percent -- believed there'll be no change.\n\nExpectations for sales fell 3.2 points, but at 54.7 was the highest of the third quarter readings. While 40.8 percent of leaders expected moderate or strong increases in sales, 22.4 percent anticipated moderate or strong decreases and 36.8 percent forecast no change.\n\nExpectations for profits fell 4.6 points to 52, with 32.4 percent of leaders anticipating moderate or strong increases, 24.9 percent moderate or strong decreases and 42.8 percent no change.\n\nExpectations for hiring fell 2.1 points to 48 with 25.9 percent of leaders forecasting moderate or strong increases in staffing, 29.4 percent moderate or strong layoffs and 44.8 percent no change.\n\nExpectations for capital expenditures fell 1.3 points -- the smallest decline between the second and third quarters among the components -- to 50.9. While 27.4 percent of leaders expected moderate or strong increases in spending, 22.4 percent anticipated moderate or strong decreases and 50.2 percent forecast no change.\n\nGross domestic product increased in Colorado at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.3 percent during the first quarter.

Interest rates are the highest in more than 20 years and inflation is nearly a third of what it used to be, yet unemployment remains historically low and a recession is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe nation's top economists, however, say the U.S. central bank might not want to get too comfortable just yet.\n\nA severe recession doesn't look like it's around the corner, but a slowdown could be, according to forecasts from Bankrate's Second-Quarter Economic Indicator Survey. Unemployment is expected to hit an almost three-year high, and over the next 12 months, employers are projected to create about half as many jobs. Driving the moderating economic environment is a Fed determined to keep interest rates high. The Fed is expected to begin modestly cutting interest rates in September as inflation takes through the end of 2025 -- or longer -- to return to its official 2 percent goalpost, economists say.\n\nSigns are already pointing to a deceleration from a rapid post-pandemic boom -- albeit not in a way that's raising any alarm bells just yet. For the first time since November 2021, joblessness is now at 4.1 percent, still historically low but up from 3.4 percent last year. The number of job openings per every unemployed worker is back to levels last seen before the outbreak. Wages, meanwhile, are still growing faster than they were before the pandemic, but firms are no longer offering the giant pay bumps exclusive to the early months of the economy's reopening.\n\nBankrate has been polling the nation's top economists on their expectations for the job market, inflation, the Federal Reserve, economic growth and more on a quarterly basis for almost a decade. Read on for the latest findings.\n\nThe U.S. jobs market is no underdog. For two consecutive years, employers have added the most jobs in a 12-month period since 1999, while the unemployment rate held below 4 percent for the longest stretch of time since the 1960s.\n\nHiring has also dodged the slowdown most economists have been expecting. Back in March 2023, the nation's top economists thought the unemployment rate would hit 4.6 percent by March 2024 and employers would be cutting jobs. Instead, unemployment only rose to 3.8 percent, and on average, employers added 242,000 jobs each month over the 12-month period. Economists have been adjusting accordingly, each quarter expecting a slowdown that isn't as fierce as the one they were expecting in the prior-polling period.\n\nYet, the message remains clear: Economists are still expecting the job market to decelerate. By June 2025, the unemployment rate is expected to hit 4.3 percent, and employers are expected to create 115,000 jobs each month, on average, over the next 12 months, down from the previous 12-month pace of 218,000, according to economists' average forecast.\n\nEvery economist expects unemployment to be higher than it is now and hiring to slow from its current pace. Responses ranged from a low of 4.1 percent to as high as 5 percent for the unemployment rate. The worst forecast penciled in job cuts of 25,000 each month, on average, over the next 12 months, while the most upbeat estimate expects job growth to average 180,000 a month. At the same time, most economists (94 percent) expect that the U.S. economy will still continue to add jobs over the next year.\n\nPrices aren't rising as quickly as they once were, with inflation most recently hitting 3.3 percent in May after rising as fast as 9.1 percent in June 2022. Still, cooling inflation has been stuck near 3 percent for the past 12 months, flatlining amid a pop in volatile energy prices. Economists are also still waiting for stickier housing and services inflation to slow.\n\nInflation could stay stuck for a while longer, the nation's top economists say. Most are stuck between thinking inflation will hit the Fed's desired 2 percent level by the end of 2025 (41 percent) or by the end of 2025 or later (41 percent). A smaller share (12 percent) say prices could hit 2 percent by the end of 2024, while 6 percent said \"other/don't know.\"\n\nEconomists aren't as upbeat about inflation as they were in the prior-quarter period. In polling from last March, the largest share of experts (35 percent) said inflation could reach the Fed's 2 percent goalpost by the end of 2024, even if those odds only slightly trailed the percentage of economists who expected 2 percent inflation by the end of 2025 (29 percent) or the end of 2026 (29 percent).\n\nEven so, economists are considerably more hopeful than they were at the beginning of 2024, when most experts (60 percent) thought inflation wouldn't hit 2 percent until the end of 2025. The recent optimism could be because prices slowed more than expected in May, after topping expectations for three straight months at the start of the year.\n\nEven with some not-so-good news on inflation at the start of the year, most economists (88 percent) still expect that the Fed will cut interest rates at some point in 2024. About half (53 percent) say the Fed will cut interest rates at its September meeting, 12 percent say the Fed will cut interest rates in November and 24 percent say the first rate cut could happen in December.\n\nThe Fed, however, likely won't cut borrowing costs as much as they initially thought they would this year. Part of that is because of the calendar. Fed officials, who once penciled in three rate cuts for 2024, have four meetings left this year. Another reason is policymakers would prefer not to cut interest rates at back-to-back meetings. It may exacerbate inflation, but economists admit it might look like they're in a rush and worried about the economy, too.\n\nEven so, the message remains clear. Whether the Fed cuts interest rates once or twice in 2024 will largely be inconsequential to consumers hard-hit by historically high borrowing costs and benefited by hot savings yields. The Fed raised interest rates 11 times by a whopping 5.25 percentage points, the fastest pace since the 1980s as it rushed to slow the economy and defeat boiling inflation.\n\n\"The timing of the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut remains in question, suggesting rates will indeed remain somewhat higher for somewhat longer,\" Hamrick says. \"On the other side of the interest rate coin, the opportunity to benefit from higher yields for savers is also persisting.\"\n\nMost economists seem to indicate that the long-feared recession spurred by higher interest rates likely isn't around the corner, even as the job market is expected to cool. Economists say the odds of a recession within the next 12 months are slightly less than 1-in-3 (32 percent), hitting the lowest level since Bankrate first started polling economists on their recession odds. Last quarter, those odds had fallen from 45 percent to a two-year low of 33 percent as the U.S. economy continued to stand its ground against higher interest rates.\n\nThe lowest odds among any economist hit 10 percent, on the grounds that forward-looking indicators of the economy are still pointing to growth ahead. Yet, one economist penciled in 100 percent odds, noting concerns about federal debts and spending.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was never expected to fall back to the level it held in the years since the 2008 financial crisis -- let alone the lows of the pandemic era. But one consequence of higher interest rates for even longer is that the key home financing rate is bound to close out the year even higher than initially expected, too.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is expected to hit 6.6 percent by the end of the year, according to the average forecast among economists in Bankrate's poll. Throughout all of 2025, meanwhile, it's projected to average a slightly lower 6.14 percent.\n\nIf it comes to fruition, that would be higher than most experts expected earlier this year. Bankrate's annual interest rate forecast for 2024, for example, penciled in a 5.75 percent mortgage rate by the end of the year.\n\nThe Fed doesn't influence mortgage rates as directly as credit card rates or deposit yields, but both borrowing costs tend to follow the same trends. Case in point: The benchmark for the 30-year fixed rate -- the 10-year Treasury yield -- has been holding among the highest levels in over a decade, as inflation stays hot, growth remains resilient and interest rates stay high. That key rate is expected to hit 3.96 percent by June 2025, according to the average forecast among the nation's top economists.\n\nMortgage rates have been stubbornly stuck above 7 percent since February, and they've been above 6 percent since the fall of 2022 after not previously reaching levels that high since 2008, according to Bankrate's historic mortgage rate data.", "source": {"uri": "bankrate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bankrate.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_foster@bankrate.com", "name": "Sarah Foster", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankrate", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007\u20132008_financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2007\u20132008 financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-rate_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-rate mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.bankrate.com/brp/2024/07/09165029/Central-Economic-indicator-Q2-2024-v2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719648", "eventUri": "eng-9719648", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The establishment survey showed the economy creating 206,000 jobs, while the household survey reported the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent (4.05 percent before rounding). Those topline numbers are healthy by almost any standard, but there is cause for concern on both sides.\n\nOn the establishment side, the prior two months' numbers were revised down by a total of 111,000, which means that the June number was only 95,000 larger than the estimate of jobs from the establishment survey that we were looking at in May. This makes the average job gain for the last three months 177,000. That is a reasonable number given current estimates of potential labor force growth, but certainly not a pace that should give the Fed cause for concern about excessive inflationary pressures.\n\nIt's also worth noting that more than a third (70,000) of the job growth in June was in the government sector, almost entirely at the state and local level. Government jobs substantially lagged behind the private sector in this recovery, so this growth is mostly a catch-up story, but it is likely an anomaly. With many state and local governments now facing shortfalls as COVID funds get depleted, they will not be hiring at anywhere near this pace going forward.\n\nOver the last three months, we have created an average of 146,000 private sector jobs. Again, this is a fine pace, but hardly one that should prompt fears of accelerating inflation.\n\nOn the household side, we have been seeing a gradual uptick in the unemployment rate since it bottomed out at 3.4 percent last April. If this trend continues, we will be having a serious issue with unemployment. As it is, we should be able to do better than 4.1 percent. The unemployment rate averaged 3.7 percent in 2019, with no clear evidence of inflationary pressures.\n\nAs Chair Powell has noted, higher unemployment disproportionately impacts groups that face discrimination in the labor market. We see this clearly with the unemployment rate for Black workers. This bottomed out at 4.8 percent last April (an all-time low). It now stands at 6.3 percent, an increase of 1.5 percentage points.\n\nGetting the unemployment rate down by another half percentage point will make a noticeable difference in the prospects for disadvantaged groups. It should be an important policy goal.\n\nOther data in the household survey also provide some basis for concern. The share of long-term unemployment (more than 26 weeks) has edged up to 22.2 percent of the unemployed. It had been under 19.0 percent at the start of the year. This indicates more people are having serious problems finding jobs.\n\nAnother item showing labor force weakness is the relatively small share of unemployment due to voluntary quits. This share stood at 11.2 percent in June, which was up slightly from 10.8 percent in May. This is very low given the overall unemployment rate. It averaged 13.1 percent in the two years before the pandemic. It peaked at 16.0 percent in September 2022. This indicates that workers don't feel the sort of confidence about their labor market prospects that we would expect given a 4.1 percent unemployment rate.\n\nThe June job report also shows that wage growth has slowed to a level that the Fed should feel comfortable with. The annualized rate for the last three months was just 3.6 percent, only a couple of tenths higher than the average for 2018-2019. The year-over-year rate was 3.9 percent.\n\nOther labor market data show a similar trend. The JOLTS data show the job openings rate falling back from a record high at the start of 2022 to roughly the same level as pre-pandemic peaks. The quit rate has fallen to a level slightly below the peaks of 2018-2019. Unemployment insurance claims and continuing claims, after hitting record lows, are now actually slightly higher as a share of the workforce than before the pandemic.\n\nNon governmental data tell the same story. For example, the Indeed Wage Tracker in April showed that wage growth for new hires averaged just 3.1 percent more than a year ago. This is the same as the rate of increase before the pandemic. Since this measure only looks at new hires, it tends to lead movements in the labor market as a whole. This supports the view that wage growth is likely to continue to slow.\n\nIt is also important to remember that the profit share of income has increased by almost 2.0 percentage points since the start of the pandemic. Unless the Fed has the view that any rise in the profit share is permanent, it should be prepared to see wage growth somewhat in excess of what might be a sustainable noninflationary long-term rate in order to restore the wage share at least to its pre-pandemic level. It will have to rise considerably further in order for the wage share to revert to its level at the start of the century.\n\nInflation Is Near the Fed's Target\n\nChair Powell has repeatedly said that the 2.0 percent target was an average, not a ceiling. That should mean that an inflation rate close to 2.0 percent is consistent with the target.\n\nTaking the year-over-year numbers we are still considerably higher than 2.0 percent, but this is mostly a story driven by rent. In the case of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the year-over-year figure is 3.3 percent, but without shelter, it is just 2.1 percent. With the PCE, year-over-year inflation is 2.6 percent, but without shelter it is less than 1.9 percent.\n\nIt is reasonable to pull out shelter since this is driven by leases that were signed 1-2 years ago. The inflation rate for rent on housing units that go on the market is very low and possibly less than zero. The inflation rate for shelter will converge on the rate for new units even if the timing of this convergence is uncertain. But the point is that the Fed can be confident that the direction of inflation in the near-term is lower, going towards the Fed's target.\n\nWe also know that expectations of inflation by many measures are back or nearly back to their pre-pandemic levels. The Atlanta Fed's measure of business expectations of year-ahead inflation is 2.3 percent, a rate that we saw at several points in 2018-2019. The other regional Feds' indexes for manufacturers' expectations of prices paid and prices received also show a return to pre-pandemic rates.\n\nThe breakeven inflation rate for five-year inflation-indexed bonds is now just over 2.2 percent, virtually the same as the rate at several points in 2018. Also, it is important to remember that the index used for these bonds is the CPI, which typically has an inflation rate that is 0.2-0.3 percentage points higher than the PCE that the Fed targets. This means that expectations in the bond market are that inflation will be at or perhaps slightly below the rate targeted by the Fed.\n\nThe story here is that the risk of an inflationary spiral like what we saw in the 1970s is now near zero. Wage growth has moderated to a pace that is almost the same as what we saw before the pandemic and is likely to slow further. In addition, inflation has been gradually slowing for the last two years and is virtually certain to continue to slow.\n\nThe Fed's Rate Cut Trade-Offs\n\nMuch reporting has framed the rate cut decision as one where the Fed has to be worried about being embarrassed by lowering rates too soon and seeing a reacceleration of inflation. The argument is that the Fed erred by waiting too long before raising rates in 2022, which allowed inflation to get higher than if the Fed had been more vigilant. Since the Fed had made this mistake, it doesn't want to again err on the side of excessive inflation by cutting rates too soon, which would be a major embarrassment.\n\nWhile that may be the framing of some observers, there is little logic to the argument. The Fed has its dual responsibilities of maintaining low inflation and maximizing employment. If it now errs by needlessly allowing the unemployment rate to continue to rise, it does not somehow even the score. This mistake is not made any better by the fact that it made a mistake in the opposite direction three years ago. The Fed has to try to make the right call now, based on the data it has.\n\nOn that front, it seems difficult to maintain that excessive inflation is a greater threat than a weakening labor market. The unemployment rate has risen 0.7 percentage points in the last 14 months. It is now 0.3 percentage points higher than the average we saw in the last two years before the pandemic. That corresponds to another 510,000 people being unemployed who would be employed if we had a stronger labor market. If current trends continue, this figure will rise further over the next year. This should be taken seriously.\n\nThere is also the point that high interest rates have put a serious dent in the housing market. Sales of existing homes are down by more than 30 percent from their peaks in 2021 before the Fed started raising rates. As a result, hundreds of thousands of potential first-time buyers are being kept out of the housing market. Millions of homeowners who might otherwise sell their homes are keeping them off the market and being prevented from making moves they want to make.\n\nWhile rates will not decline to the point where we again see the 3.0 percent mortgages of 2021, it is reasonable to believe that lower rates from the Fed can get the mortgage rate back under 6.0 percent and eventually close to 5.0 percent. That would make a huge difference in the housing market.\n\nHigh rates are also increasing financial instability. It is unlikely that we will see more failures like the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023, but banks will be hit in the months and years ahead by the write-down of loans on commercial real estate. Lower rates will make it far easier for them to get through a rash of defaults and bankruptcies in this sector. The housing market and financial stability may not rank as high as maximizing employment and low inflation on the Fed's priority list, but they are factors it should take into account in setting interest rates.\n\nThere are events in the world that could see a reigniting of inflation. The Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have sent shipping costs soaring, which will be passed on in higher prices. A larger war in the Middle East could take oil offline and send gas prices soaring again. Many other possible disasters could be added to this list.\n\nBut these sorts of events are always a risk. The Fed can't design monetary policy with the idea that it should try to limit inflation in the event some crisis occurs. It needs to respond to the economy that it is seeing at the time. And right now, this economy is arguing for lower rates.", "source": {"uri": "counterpunch.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Counter Punch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dean_baker@counterpunch.org", "name": "Dean Baker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Workforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Board of Governors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment benefits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_Silicon_Valley_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Write-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyperinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Marriner_S._Eccles_Federal_Reserve_Board_Building-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719648", "eventUri": "eng-9719648", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The poll shows clear divisions, however, when broken down by region and gross national income level.\n\nIn the United States, which is at odds with China on many fronts, from trade to Taiwan, only 9 percent have confidence in Xi. Another 79 percent expressed little or no confidence in him and 12 percent said they didn't know or refused to answer.\n\nXi's approval rating was nearly as abysmal in Canada, with 16 percent expressing faith in his role as a world leader and 74 percent voicing little to no confidence.\n\nIn Europe, far fewer respondents are confident in Xi's leadership than those who are, but the size of the gap varies.\n\nThe Chinese leader fares best in Greece, where he has the confidence of 41 percent of the people versus 59 percent who distrust him. Meanwhile, 24 percent of Hungarians and Italians have at least some confidence in him, relatively high for the 10 European countries included in the poll.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum are Sweden and Poland, with just 9 percent of respondents in each confident in Xi.\n\nXi is as unpopular a figure in Turkey and Israel as he is in much of Europe, with confidence levels of 15 and 13 percent, respectively, but he has the confidence of 52 percent of Tunisians.\n\nPew pointed out that confidence in Xi has fallen 6 points in Israel since last year. The slip may have been driven by his refusal to condemn Hamas for its October 7 terrorist attacks in Jewish communities and his criticism of Israel's retaliatory strikes in Gaza.\n\nA broad spectrum of views can be seen in the Asia-Pacific where confidence in Xi is at its lowest and some of its highest levels. Only 32 percent of Thais and 36 percent of Singaporeans lack confidence in the leader, while nearly twice as many have at least some trust in him.\n\nSingapore was the exception among high-income countries in the region surveyed, though confidence in Xi is down 6 percent from last year. South Korea (83 percent), Australia (84 percent), and Japan (90 percent) are overwhelmingly distrustful of Xi.\n\nIndia, whose relations with China have soured in recent years over border clashes and competition for influence in South Asia, was an exception among middle-income nations with only 19 percent of Indians confident in Xi.\n\nThe Philippines was another exception, with slightly more (50 percent) Filipinos confident in him than not (45 percent). The Southeast Asian country is locked in a bitter territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea.\n\nXi is relatively well regarded in Africa, with Kenyans (64 percent) expressing the highest level of confidence of the 35 countries polled. South Africans were more divided on Xi with 36 percent at least somewhat confident in him and 30 percent not.\n\nThe Latin American countries surveyed generally lacked faith in Xi's influence, ranging from Peruvians as the most confident (31 percent) to Brazilians as the least (15 percent).\n\nThe Chinese embassy in the U.S. did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.", "source":

With the upward move, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have once again reached new record intraday highs.\n\nCurrently, the Nasdaq is up 79.13 points or 0.4 percent at 18,508.42, the S&P 500 is up 17.68 points or 0.3 percent at 5,594.66 and the Dow is up 59.83 points or 0.2 percent at 39,351.80.\n\nThe advance on Wall Street partly reflects strength among tech stocks after Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) reported its second quarter sales surged much more than expected.\n\nShares of Taiwan Semiconductor, which supplies chips for AI giants like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), are jumping by 2.7 percent.\n\nOverall trading activity remains somewhat subdued, however, as traders look ahead to the release of closely watched consumer price inflation data on Thursday.\n\nEconomists expect the annual rate of consumer price growth to slow to 3.1 percent in June from 3.3 percent in May, while the annual rate of core consumer price growth is expected to hold at 3.4 percent.\n\nDuring congressional testimony, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said more \"good data\" would strengthen the central bank's confidence inflation is moving sustainably toward its 2 percent target and lead to a potential interest rate cut.\n\nPowell also warned of the risk that leaving interest rates at an elevated level for too long could jeopardize economic growth.\n\n\"In light of the progress made both in lowering inflation and in cooling the labor market over the past two years, elevated inflation is not the only risk we face,\" he said. \"Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.\"\n\nGold stocks have moved sharply higher on the day, driving the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index up by 2.7 percent to its best intraday level in well over a month.\n\nThe rally by gold stocks comes amid an increase by the price of the precious metal, with gold for August delivery climbing $15.20 to $2,383.10 an ounce.\n\nConsiderable strength is also visible among semiconductor stocks, as reflected by the 1.4 percent gain being posted by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. The index has reached a new record intraday high.\n\nPharmaceutical and brokerage stocks are also seeing some strength on the day, while most of the other major sectors are showing more modest moves.\n\nOther Markets\n\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index climbed by 0.6 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index slid by 0.7 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the major European markets have all moved to the upside on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is up by 0.6 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index are both up by 0.9 percent.\n\nIn the bond market, treasuries have shown a lack of direction ahead of tomorrow's inflation data. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by less than a basis point at 4.295 percent.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact:

The Nordic Hedge Index edged down 0.3 percent in June, with equity hedge funds and CTAs dragging down performance. Nevertheless, the industry ended the first half of the year with a gain of 7.5 percent, marking the best half-year performance since the first half of 2009, when the industry advanced 6.7 percent on average.\n\nEquity long/short, equity-long only, and CTAs all recorded losses in June. Conversely, fixed-income hedge funds extended their positive streak to 13 consecutive months, gaining 0.5 percent in June to end the first half of the year up 7.3 percent. The small group of multi-manager hedge funds gained an estimated 1.1 percent in June, bringing the half-year performance to 6.2 percent. Diversified funds, which include multi-asset, multi-strategy strategies along with niche strategies, rose 5.2 percent in the first six months of the year, with a marginal 0.2 percent increase in June.\n\nNordic systematic trend-following CTAs, macro and managed futures vehicles within the CTA category experienced an average decline of 0.8 percent in June but closed the first half of 2024 with a 13.5 percent gain. Notably, about 8.5 percent of this advance is attributable to the performance of Anna Fund, a Norwegian fund employing a momentum strategy on Bitcoin futures that advanced 141 percent in the first half of the year. Long-only equity managers with hedge fund-like characteristics, a category outside of the Nordic Hedge Index, experienced an average decline of 0.9 percent in June to end the first half of the year in positive territory at 13.6 percent. Meanwhile, long/short equity hedge funds were up 8.0 percent over the first half of the year despite an average decline of 1.3 percent in June.\n\nThe performance dispersion between the best- and worst-performing members of the Nordic Hedge Index narrowed month-over-month. In June, the top 20 percent of Nordic hedge funds achieved an average gain of 2.7 percent, while the bottom 20 percent incurred an average loss of 4.6 percent, representing a top-to-bottom dispersion of 7.3 percent versus 7.9 percent in May. In May, the top 20 percent recorded an average gain of 5.8 percent, with the bottom 20 percent experiencing a 2.1 percent loss. About three in every five funds with reported June figures posted gains last month.\n\nAnna Fund, a Norwegian fund that employs a momentum strategy on Bitcoin futures, leads the performance charts with a surge of 142 percent in the first half of 2024. Founded by three Norwegian friends in mid-2023, Anna Fund uses inverse perpetual Bitcoin futures to execute its momentum strategy, focusing on capitalizing on Bitcoin's fluctuations using price and volume data. Starting with assets just under NOK 50 million before the turn of the year, Anna Fund manages NOK 288 million at the mid-point of the year.\n\nThree vehicles managed by Danish boutique fund manager Othania stood out as top performers in the Nordic Hedge Index last month. Othania Globale Aktier, Othania's pure equity fund that dynamically shifts exposure between \"offensive\" and \"defensive\" equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on market conditions, gained 5.2 percent in June, while Othania Allokering Verden advanced 4.8 percent. Operating on the same proprietary investment model as Othania Globale Aktier, Othania Allokering VERDEN allocates capital into equity or bond ETFs on a monthly basis. Othania's fund of fund vehicle, Balanceret Makro, posted a gain of 3.6 percent in June.\n\nTech-focused long/short equity fund Thyra Hedge also ranked among the five best performers in June with an advance of 4.2 percent. Managed by Inge Heydorn, Thyra Hedge had a solid 2023 with an advance of 17.6 percent and continued its strong performance into the first half of 2024 with a 14.5 percent gain. HP Hedge Danish Bonds, managed by Danish fixed-income boutique HP Fonds, also delivered a solid June with a return of 4.0 percent, closing the first half of 2024 in positive territory at 6.8 percent.\n\nIn September, HedgeNordic introduced a new sub-strategy category to the Nordic Hedge Index: Equity Long-Only (ELO). This category is home to funds that would fall short of qualifying as a hedge fund due to their long-only trading approach but exhibit habitual characteristics of a hedge fund strategy (e.g., leverage and derivatives usage, portfolio concentration, fee structure, a spin-off of a long/short strategy, and absolute return objectives, among others).", "source": {"uri": "hedgenordic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HedgeNordic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eugeniu_guzun@hedgenordic.com", "name": "Eugeniu Guzun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_countries", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nordic countries"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statistical dispersion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_futures_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Managed futures account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_following", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trend following"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixed income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stockholm"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stockholm"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long/short_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "short equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_krone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norwegian krone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hedge (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multiplicative inverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_return", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Absolute return"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derivative (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://hedgenordic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/glen-carrie-k06emqjiB7M-unsplash.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719648", "eventUri": "eng-9719648", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stockholm"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

With the strong upward move, the S&P 500 closed above 5,600 for the first time ever.\n\nThe major averages saw further upside going into the close, ending the day near their highs of the session. The Nasdaq surged 218.16 points or 1.2 percent to 18,647.45, the Dow shot up 429.39 points or 1.1 percent to 39,721.36 and the S&P 500 jumped 56.93 points or 1.0 percent to 5,633.91.\n\nThe rally on Wall Street was partly due to strength among technology stocks, as reflected by the notable advance by the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which also reached a new record closing high.\n\nThe strength among tech stocks came after Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) reported its second quarter sales surged much more than expected.\n\nShares of Taiwan Semiconductor, which supplies chips for AI giants like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), spiked by 3.5 percent.\n\nStocks may also have benefitted from optimism about the outlook for interest rates ahead of the release of closely watched consumer price inflation data on Thursday.\n\nEconomists expect the annual rate of consumer price growth to slow to 3.1 percent in June from 3.3 percent in May, while the annual rate of core consumer price growth is expected to hold at 3.4 percent.\n\nDuring congressional testimony, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said more \"good data\" would strengthen the central bank's confidence inflation is moving sustainably toward its 2 percent target and lead to a potential interest rate cut.\n\nPowell also warned of the risk that leaving interest rates at an elevated level for too long could jeopardize economic growth.\n\n\"In light of the progress made both in lowering inflation and in cooling the labor market over the past two years, elevated inflation is not the only risk we face,\" he said. \"Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.\"\n\nGold stocks showed a substantial move to the upside on day, driving the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index up by 2.9 percent to its best closing level in over two years. The rally by gold stocks came amid an increase by the price of the precious metal.\n\nSignificant strength was also visible among semiconductor stocks, as reflected by the 2.4 percent surge by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. The index reached a new record closing high.\n\nHousing stocks also saw considerable strength over the course of the session, resulting in a 1.9 percent jumped by the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index.\n\nBrokerage, biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks also saw notable strength on the day, moving higher along with most of the other major sectors.\n\nOther Markets\n\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index climbed by 0.6 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index slid by 0.7 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the major European markets have all moved to the upside on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index advanced by 0.7 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index both jumped by 0.9 percent.\n\nIn the bond market, treasuries showed a lack of direction for much of the day before closing modestly higher. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, dipped 2.0 basis points to 4.280 percent.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nTrading on Thursday is likely to be driven by reaction to the Labor Department's report on consumer price inflation and the data's impact on the outlook for interest rates.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source":

Despite this confidence, many of these executives have concerns about barriers that might prevent further AI adoption.\n\nAn overwhelming 94 percent say their organization uses AI in some form, while six percent are still exploring or researching options. The motivations behind adoption are not entirely universal, with 40 percent of executives feeling pressured to prioritize adoption and investment in AI following industry-wide momentum around the technology.\n\nBarriers preventing some businesses from adopting AI as much as they would like include budget restrictions (41 percent), a shortage of AI talent within the business (38 percent), and technical complexity (35 percent). Meanwhile, the primary concerns businesses have related to AI adoption, according to the executives, include integration challenges (44 percent), cost and ROI uncertainty (42 percent), and data privacy and IP security (38 percent). Interestingly, only 28 percent of respondents said there is cultural resistance to AI adoption from within their organization.\n\n\"AI adoption isn't some 'on or off' switch,\" says Michal Szymczak, head of AI strategy at Zartis. \"To a lot of businesses, it involves a significant financial investment, and there are complex questions to grapple with surrounding data privacy, or integration with existing technology stacks. That makes executives' confidence in their company's AI skill set rather ironic. They puff their chests out, while simultaneously pointing to all the obstacles that could stop them in their tracks. That feels like a severe underestimation of how much work needs to happen to make AI capabilities work with software development and DevOps practices.\"\n\nSoftware development is the most popular area (59 percent) where executives say they plan to make AI investments with this money in 2024. The next most popular areas include quality assurance (44 percent) and DevOps and automation (44 percent). This lines up with the data showing that skills shortage and talent acquisition (46 percent), quality assurance and testing (40 percent), and continuous integration and deployment (40 percent) are the top three cited challenges organizations face within their software development teams today.\n\nHow much money will be saved in the long term remains uncertain.

The major averages have all climbed firmly into positive territory, with the S&P 500 breaking above 5,600 for the first time ever.\n\nCurrently, the major averages are just off their highs of the session. The Nasdaq is up 180.09 points or 1.0 percent at 18,609.38, the S&P 500 is up 37.72 points or 0.7 percent at 5,614.70 and the Dow is up 197.17 points or 0.5 percent at 39,489.14.\n\nThe advance on Wall Street partly reflects strength among technology stocks, as reflected by the notable advance by the tech-heavy Nasdaq.\n\nThe strength among tech stocks comes after Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) reported its second quarter sales surged much more than expected.\n\nShares of Taiwan Semiconductor, which supplies chips for AI giants like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), are jumping by 2.7 percent.\n\nStocks may also be benefiting from optimism about the outlook for interest rates ahead of the release of closely watched consumer price inflation data on Thursday.\n\nEconomists expect the annual rate of consumer price growth to slow to 3.1 percent in June from 3.3 percent in May, while the annual rate of core consumer price growth is expected to hold at 3.4 percent.\n\nDuring congressional testimony, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said more \"good data\" would strengthen the central bank's confidence inflation is moving sustainably toward its 2 percent target and lead to a potential interest rate cut.\n\nPowell also warned of the risk that leaving interest rates at an elevated level for too long could jeopardize economic growth.\n\n\"In light of the progress made both in lowering inflation and in cooling the labor market over the past two years, elevated inflation is not the only risk we face,\" he said. \"Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.\"\n\nSector News\n\nGold stocks have moved sharply higher on the day, driving the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index up by 2.3 percent. Earlier in the session, the index reached its best intraday level in over two years.\n\nThe rally by gold stocks comes amid an increase by the price of the precious metal, with gold for August delivery climbing $11.30 to $2,379.20 an ounce.\n\nSignificant strength also remains visible among semiconductor stocks, as reflected by the 2.1percent surge by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. The index has reached a new record intraday high.\n\nHousing stocks have also moved to the upside over the course of the session, resulting in a 1.7 percent advance by the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index.\n\nBiotechnology, brokerage and pharmaceutical stocks are also seeing some strength on the day, moving higher along with most of the other major sectors.\n\nOther Markets\n\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index climbed by 0.6 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index slid by 0.7 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the major European markets have all moved to the upside on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index advanced by 0.7 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index both jumped by 0.9 percent.\n\nIn the bond market, treasuries have shown a lack of direction ahead of tomorrow's inflation data. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by less than a basis point at 4.290 percent.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact:

Democrats are actually gaining a bit.\n\nAccording to our friends at Rasmussen Reports, 91 percent of likely voters say economic issues will be important in this year's presidential election. Sixty-eight percent say the economy will be very important.\n\nRepublicans are heavily favored by those who say the economy will be very important. Fifty-nine percent of likely voters who see the economy as very important in this year's election say they trust the Republicans more, versus 32 percent who say they trust the Democrats.\n\nAmong all likely voters, Republicans have the lead on economic issues -- but it is not as wide and it is narrowing. In April, the GOP was ahead by 13 points, with a 51 percent majority favoring Republicans compared with 38 percent favoring Democrats. In the June poll released this week, 48 percent said they trust Republicans more, and 41 percent say they trust Democrats more.\n\nThe demographics are interesting and promising for the Republicans, not just for this election but for the future. Fifty-four percent of white voters trust the GOP more on economics, compared with 36 percent for Democrats. Among Hispanics, the GOP leads 50 percent to the Democrats' 40 percent. If that translates into increased Hispanic votes for Republicans, Democrats will have a hard time winning national and state-wide offices going forward.\n\nBlack voters overwhelmingly still trust Democrats more, with just 25 percent favoring Republicans and 62 percent favoring Democrats. But that's less lopsided than it has been in the past.\n\nThere's a gender gap on economic issues, but it favors Republicans. Men and women are equally likely to see the economy as important for this year's election. Fifty-two percent of men say Republicans are better on the economy, compared with 37 percent who say Democrats are better. Among women voters, the two parties are tied at 44 percent. If you win men and tie with women, you win elections.\n\nThe story is similar when we focus in on inflation. Eighty-four percent of likely voters believe the issue of inflation will be important in this year's presidential election, including 61 percent who expect it to be very important. Among those who expect it to be very important, 69 percent trust Republicans more on the issue.\n\nThere's a partisan gap when it comes to the importance of inflation for the election. Seventy-four percent of Republicans say it is a likely to be a very important issue in the presidential election, as do 69 percent of independents. But just 43 percent of Democrats do.\n\nThat's likely a bit of wishful thinking on the part of Democrats. They understand that if inflation is very important in this year's election, Donald Trump is more likely to win in November. So, when asked by Rasmussen's pollsters, they say they think it will not be that important.\n\nRasmussen also asks voters how serious of a problem they think inflation is right now -- as opposed to the role it will play in the election. Eighty-two percent say it is a serious problem, including 63 percent who say it is a very serious problem.\n\nThere is also a partisan gap on this question. Seventy-eight percent of Republicans and 68 percent of unaffiliated voters say inflation is a very serious problem. But among Democrats, just 45 percent say it is very serious.\n\nThat might help explain why Republicans are more trusted on the issue of inflation. With partisan Democrats not believing inflation is all that serious of a matter, it is reasonable to assume that Democrat officials are less serious about fighting inflation as a policy goal. The Democrats have other priorities; and if it takes a rise in inflation to accomplish their goals, they're more likely to accept that trade-off.\n\nCertainly, that's been the case with the Biden administration. The Biden administration has embraced a host of policies that have had inflationary effects -- from climate change policies to seemingly unlimited streams of funding for Ukraine's war with Russia, diversity equity and inclusion programs that weigh down production, and massive deficit spending. The administration even perversely called its green new deal spending plan the \"Inflation Reduction Act,\" showing how unserious it is about the issue.\n\nRepublicans, however, should not assume they can easily glide to election day on the issue of inflation. After surging in the beginning of this year, inflation has moderated quite a bit. It's still running very hot -- the consumer price index was up 3.3 percent in May from a year earlier -- but it is cooling. Although we think it is unlikely, there is a nontrivial chance the Fed will cut in September, which could create the impression that inflation is no longer as much of a threat.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_carney@breitbart.com", "name": "John Carney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmussen_Reports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rasmussen Reports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender pay gap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green New Deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficit_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deficit spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/07/trump-7-10-20-flickr.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719648", "eventUri": "eng-9719648", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Pricing and availability subject to change.\n\nBankrate's Q2 Economic Indicator Survey: What economists see for the job market, inflation, the Fed and more in the year ahead\n\nSarah Foster\n\nUpdated July 10, 2024 at 6:10 AM\n\nTo the outside viewer, the Federal Reserve looks like it's come close to achieving the impossible soft landing of the U.S. economy. Interest rates are the highest in more than 20 years and inflation is nearly a third of what it used to be, yet unemployment remains historically low and a recession is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe nation's top economists, however, say the U.S. central bank might not want to get too comfortable just yet.\n\nA severe recession doesn't look like it's around the corner, but a slowdown could be, according to forecasts from Bankrate's Second-Quarter Economic Indicator Survey. Unemployment is expected to hit an almost three-year high, and over the next 12 months, employers are projected to create about half as many jobs. Driving the moderating economic environment is a Fed determined to keep interest rates high. The Fed is expected to begin modestly cutting interest rates in September as inflation takes through the end of 2025 -- or longer -- to return to its official 2 percent goalpost, economists say.\n\nSigns are already pointing to a deceleration from a rapid post-pandemic boom -- albeit not in a way that's raising any alarm bells just yet. For the first time since November 2021, joblessness is now at 4.1 percent, still historically low but up from 3.4 percent last year. The number of job openings per every unemployed worker is back to levels last seen before the outbreak. Wages, meanwhile, are still growing faster than they were before the pandemic, but firms are no longer offering the giant pay bumps exclusive to the early months of the economy's reopening.\n\nThe economy's full-year story is yet to be written. The good news is that the U.S. economy has continued to avoid a recession. The headwinds of elevated prices and high interest rates, however, are being felt, with the unemployment rate edging up from a multi-decade low.\n\n-- Mark Hamrick, Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst\n\nBankrate has been polling the nation's top economists on their expectations for the job market, inflation, the Federal Reserve, economic growth and more on a quarterly basis for almost a decade. Read on for the latest findings.\n\nKey insights on the economy from Bankrate's Q2 2024 Economic Indicator poll\n\nUnemployment seen hitting a near three-year high by June 2025\n\nThe U.S. jobs market is no underdog. For two consecutive years, employers have added the most jobs in a 12-month period since 1999, while the unemployment rate held below 4 percent for the longest stretch of time since the 1960s.\n\nHiring has also dodged the slowdown most economists have been expecting. Back in March 2023, the nation's top economists thought the unemployment rate would hit 4.6 percent by March 2024 and employers would be cutting jobs. Instead, unemployment only rose to 3.8 percent, and on average, employers added 242,000 jobs each month over the 12-month period. Economists have been adjusting accordingly, each quarter expecting a slowdown that isn't as fierce as the one they were expecting in the prior-polling period.\n\nYet, the message remains clear: Economists are still expecting the job market to decelerate. By June 2025, the unemployment rate is expected to hit 4.3 percent, and employers are expected to create 115,000 jobs each month, on average, over the next 12 months, down from the previous 12-month pace of 218,000, according to economists' average forecast.\n\nEvery economist expects unemployment to be higher than it is now and hiring to slow from its current pace. Responses ranged from a low of 4.1 percent to as high as 5 percent for the unemployment rate. The worst forecast penciled in job cuts of 25,000 each month, on average, over the next 12 months, while the most upbeat estimate expects job growth to average 180,000 a month. At the same time, most economists (94 percent) expect that the U.S. economy will still continue to add jobs over the next year.\n\nWhat the nation's top economists are saying about the job market\n\nU.S. job growth is expected to remain in a lower gear over the next 12 months as restrictive monetary policy continues to put downward pressure on consumer and business spending.\n\n-- Scott Anderson, Chief Economist at BMO Capital Markets\n\nAs long as even a moderate expansion continues, and we let in foreign workers at recent rates, the labor market should continue its expansion for the next year.\n\n-- Robert Frick, Corporate Economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union\n\nInflation could stay hot through 2025 -- or longer\n\nPrices aren't rising as quickly as they once were, with inflation most recently hitting 3.3 percent in May after rising as fast as 9.1 percent in June 2022. Still, cooling inflation has been stuck near 3 percent for the past 12 months, flatlining amid a pop in volatile energy prices. Economists are also still waiting for stickier housing and services inflation to slow.\n\nInflation could stay stuck for a while longer, the nation's top economists say. Most are stuck between thinking inflation will hit the Fed's desired 2 percent level by the end of 2025 (41 percent) or by the end of 2025 or later (41 percent). A smaller share (12 percent) say prices could hit 2 percent by the end of 2024, while 6 percent said \"other/don't know.\"\n\nEconomists aren't as upbeat about inflation as they were in the prior-quarter period. In polling from last March, the largest share of experts (35 percent) said inflation could reach the Fed's 2 percent goalpost by the end of 2024, even if those odds only slightly trailed the percentage of economists who expected 2 percent inflation by the end of 2025 (29 percent) or the end of 2026 (29 percent).\n\nEven so, economists are considerably more hopeful than they were at the beginning of 2024, when most experts (60 percent) thought inflation wouldn't hit 2 percent until the end of 2025. The recent optimism could be because prices slowed more than expected in May, after topping expectations for three straight months at the start of the year.\n\nWhat the nation's top economists are saying about inflation\n\nMore disinflation is in the pipeline, as lower goods and energy prices, combined with cooling housing costs that show up in the inflation indices with a lag, will help bring overall inflation closer to the Fed's 2 percent target by the end of 2024.\n\n-- Yelena Maleyev, Senior Economist at KPMG\n\nHousing disinflation should show up in the third quarter, significantly impacting the topline inflation number. That said, it will take more time for inflation to get back to 2 percent due to the structural changes of the economy in the post-pandemic era.\n\n-- Tuan Nguyen, Economist at RSM\n\nFed most likely to cut interest rates at September meeting\n\nEven with some not-so-good news on inflation at the start of the year, most economists (88 percent) still expect that the Fed will cut interest rates at some point in 2024. About half (53 percent) say the Fed will cut interest rates at its September meeting, 12 percent say the Fed will cut interest rates in November and 24 percent say the first rate cut could happen in December.\n\nThe Fed, however, likely won't cut borrowing costs as much as they initially thought they would this year. Part of that is because of the calendar. Fed officials, who once penciled in three rate cuts for 2024, have four meetings left this year. Another reason is policymakers would prefer not to cut interest rates at back-to-back meetings. It may exacerbate inflation, but economists admit it might look like they're in a rush and worried about the economy, too.\n\nEven so, the message remains clear. Whether the Fed cuts interest rates once or twice in 2024 will largely be inconsequential to consumers hard-hit by historically high borrowing costs and benefited by hot savings yields. The Fed raised interest rates 11 times by a whopping 5.25 percentage points, the fastest pace since the 1980s as it rushed to slow the economy and defeat boiling inflation.\n\n\"The timing of the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut remains in question, suggesting rates will indeed remain somewhat higher for somewhat longer,\" Hamrick says. \"On the other side of the interest rate coin, the opportunity to benefit from higher yields for savers is also persisting.\"\n\nWhat the nation's top economists are saying about interest rate cuts\n\nThe next rate cut is likely to occur in either September or December, though the Fed's official forecasts from the June FOMC now show that a slight majority of policymakers see December as the better choice.\n\n-- Mike Englund, Chief Economist at Action Economics\n\nWe continue to believe a July onset of the easing cycle would have been optimal given easing inflation and softening labor market conditions, but a September onset is now more likely given policymakers' backward-looking hawkish bias.\n\n-- Gregory Daco, Chief Economist at EY\n\nThe Fed has forcefully communicated the need to see a definitive slowdown in inflation, even though it may contain lagging housing shelter data, and therefore, to maintain its verbal credibility, it will hold back on a rate cut.\n\n-- Lawrence Yun, Chief Economist, National Association of Realtors\n\nUS economy has a 33% chance of being in a recession by this time next year\n\nMost economists seem to indicate that the long-feared recession spurred by higher interest rates likely isn't around the corner, even as the job market is expected to cool. Economists say the odds of a recession within the next 12 months are slightly less than 1-in-3 (32 percent), hitting the lowest level since Bankrate first started polling economists on their recession odds. Last quarter, those odds had fallen from 45 percent to a two-year low of 33 percent as the U.S. economy continued to stand its ground against higher interest rates.\n\nThe lowest odds among any economist hit 10 percent, on the grounds that forward-looking indicators of the economy are still pointing to growth ahead. Yet, one economist penciled in 100 percent odds, noting concerns about federal debts and spending.\n\nWhat the nation's top economists are saying about the chances of a US recession\n\nRecession fears are overdone and premature. The economic data has generally come in weaker than expected, but this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that this occurs without the economy falling into a recession. Not all economic data surprises are equal and the hard data, which matters, has held up.\n\n-- Ryan Sweet, Chief Economist at Oxford Economics\n\nThe risk of a recession occurring through the next year has fallen precipitously since early 2023. The economy has proved resilient to the current high interest rate environment, and with rates likely to start coming in by the end of the year, some additional weight will be removed.\n\n-- Dante DeAntonio, Senior Director of Economic Research at Moody's Analytics\n\nI have been slow to let go of the forecast of a mild recession in coming quarters. At this point, I can no longer deny the resilience of the U.S. economy, aided by the infusion of federal spending on infrastructure, chip manufacturing, and other such programs. At the same time, I believe that high interest rates are still acting as a drag on economic activity.\n\n-- Bernard Markstein, President and Chief Economist at Markstein Advisors\n\nMortgage rates to stay at decade-plus high by end of year\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was never expected to fall back to the level it held in the years since the 2008 financial crisis -- let alone the lows of the pandemic era. But one consequence of higher interest rates for even longer is that the key home financing rate is bound to close out the year even higher than initially expected, too.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is expected to hit 6.6 percent by the end of the year, according to the average forecast among economists in Bankrate's poll. Throughout all of 2025, meanwhile, it's projected to average a slightly lower 6.14 percent.\n\nIf it comes to fruition, that would be higher than most experts expected earlier this year. Bankrate's annual interest rate forecast for 2024, for example, penciled in a 5.75 percent mortgage rate by the end of the year.\n\nThe Fed doesn't influence mortgage rates as directly as credit card rates or deposit yields, but both borrowing costs tend to follow the same trends. Case in point: The benchmark for the 30-year fixed rate -- the 10-year Treasury yield -- has been holding among the highest levels in over a decade, as inflation stays hot, growth remains resilient and interest rates stay high. That key rate is expected to hit 3.96 percent by June 2025, according to the average forecast among the nation's top economists.\n\nMortgage rates have been stubbornly stuck above 7 percent since February, and they've been above 6 percent since the fall of 2022 after not previously reaching levels that high since 2008, according to Bankrate's historic mortgage rate data.\n\nWhat the nation's top economists are saying about mortgage rates\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve does not directly impact mortgage rates, longer-term rates including mortgage rates do price in the expected path of future Fed rate moves. Once the Fed kicks off a rate cutting cycle, we do expect that mortgage rates will move somewhat lower. However, we expect that this cutting cycle will be relatively brief, and if markets agree with that expectation, long-term rates will not drop that far.\n\n-- Mike Fratantoni, Chief Economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association\n\nPersistent inflation and the Fed's commitment to maintaining higher rates for an extended period are expected to keep mortgage rates elevated and within a narrow range in the near term.\n\n-- Odeta Kushi, Deputy Chief Economist at First American Financial Corporation\n\nMethodology\n\nThe Second-Quarter 2024 Bankrate Economic Indicator Survey of economists was conducted Dec. 11-18.

It does not include Qatari nationals or residents who were outside the State boundaries on June 30, 2024.\n\nGiving a breakdown of the population during April 2024, NPC statistics showed 25-64-year-olds make up 73.2 percent of the population, while those above 65 years were merely 1.4 percent. Those below 15 years made up 14.3 percent of the population, while the 15-24 age group constituted 11.1 percent of the country's population.\n\nThe country saw 2,496 babies born in April 2024 and registered 221 deaths.\n\nThe rise in population comes even as the country registers an ever-increasing number of visitors for tourism, leisure and business purposes.\n\nThe total number of inbound visitors reached about 382,000 in April 2024, recording a monthly increase of 16.3 percent (compared to March 2024) and an annual increase of 17.9 percent (compared to April 2023).\n\nThe highest number of visitors was from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries at 42 percent, followed by 22.9 percent from countries in Asia and Oceania other than Arab and GCC states, 19.2 percent from Europe, 8 percent from Arab countries other than GCC, and 6.2 percent from Americas. As for visitors by type of port, the visitors via air made up the highest percentage with 55 percent of the total number of visitors, said the National Planning Council.", "source": {"uri": "thepeninsulaqatar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peninsula"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Cooperation_Council", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Cooperation Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oceania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://thepeninsulaqatar.com/get/maximage/20240613_1718273367-517.jpg?1718273367", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719648", "eventUri": "eng-9719648", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2008-10-", "textStart": 307, "textEnd": 319}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

They have thus accumulated a year and a half with a downward trend, but in 2024 the contraction accentuated to double-digit rates. The June drop was the second most severe of the year, partly affected by fewer business days and Father's Day not being able to offset the losses. In the first semester, the accumulated loss in retail sales was 17.2 percent and compared to May 2024, they increased 1.2 percent.\n\nCAME's SME retail sales index fell 21.9 percent year-on-year in the sixth month, thus marking the second most severe contraction so far this year. No sales item escaped the general downward trend, highlighting the losses in perfumery (42 percent), pharmacy (32.8 percent) and food and beverages (26.6 percent).\n\nFrom the CAME they warned that \"although businesses are more relieved by the greater stability in the price lists they receive, the dynamics of sales, which are not rising, are worrying.\" The drop in consumption is a direct consequence of the loss of purchasing power associated with the deregulations promoted by the Government and which in its view are a way to clean up the economy.\n\nSpecifically regarding Father's Day, CAME noted that \"it helped to boost sales of products linked to that date, but this only occurred in the previous days, there was no subsequent sale, as usually happens.\" That is, it allowed a slight change in the monthly downward trend but did not reverse the deterioration in comparative terms with 2023. In June, retail sales grew 1.2 percent compared to May.\n\nThey also noticed that people sought to buy in installments, \"with a lot of demand for the Cuota Simple program.\" And specifically in the area of food and beverages, merchants said that \"the drop in consumption was due to the fact that many people turned to wholesale markets in search of better prices,\" this despite the fact that the Government makes an effort to point out that inflation is going down. In the accumulated year, SME sales recorded a drop of 17.2 percent year-on-year.\n\nItem by item\n\nThe seven sales segments that make up the CAME retail sales index recorded year-on-year declines in June. The most notable was perfumery, 42 percent and 32.5 percent cumulatively, this is because \"they are expensive and can be dispensed with,\" the entity maintains. \"Perfume shops consulted affirm that people are buying many products in the category in supermarkets or stores, regardless of the lower quality they receive.\"\n\nIn second place, the pharmacy segment stood out, 32.8 percent year-on-year and 29.6 percent in the first six months of the year: \"pharmacies are going through a very uneven situation, among purely pharmaceutical products sales fall more moderately than In perfumery and medicines, people ask for the cheapest brand,\" they indicated.\n\nThird place goes to the drop in food and beverage sales in the order of 26.6 percent year-on-year in June, with a cumulative loss of 21.8 percent. In this regard, CAME warned that \"people buy fewer quantities, very selectively, they refer to the necessary products, they change first brands for second and third ones, and they take advantage of the offers as much as possible: the general opinion of the businesses consulted is that they are going through a critical situation, with more stable prices, but with the financial situation being very delicate.\"\n\nSales in bazaars, decoration, home textiles and furniture fell 24.7 percent year-on-year and 17.8 percent in the first half, in this area \"sales had one of the worst months of the year, with few people consulting, even During the week of Father's Day, inexpensive products were sold and in stores that made quotas available.\"\n\nHardware, electrical materials and construction materials is another segment that fell 23.3 percent year-on-year in the sixth month of the year and 20.4 percent accumulated. \"Although sales linked to public works rose, the same did not happen with residential. People continue to postpone more expensive purchasing decisions, even when there are installment options,\" the entity warns.\n\nIn footwear and leather goods, sales fell 20.7 percent in June and 12.1 percent in the first semester: \"Father's Day generated better sales than in previous months, but sales did not reactivate compared to June of last year \".\n\nFinally, in textiles and clothing, sales fell 0.9 percent year-on-year in June but have accumulated an increase of 4.9 percent in the first six months: \"Businesses resorted to liquidations and great offers to get rid of stock and obtain liquidity. Father's Day helped, especially when it came to sports and casual wear.

Despite slow deployment though manufacturers reported above-average cost benefits (48 percent).\n\nConcerns around security, response accuracy, and costs have forced most businesses to slow down their planned initiatives and be more strategic about the balance between cost and benefit. Security worries have tripled, accuracy concerns have grown fivefold, and transparency issues have quadrupled since 2023. Manufacturers have some of the most concerns around response accuracy (44 percent) and some of the least concerns around job displacement (three percent) compared to other industries.\n\n\"While many manufacturers see the potential benefits of generative AI, challenges such as response accuracy and cost are causing them to take a more cautious approach. This is reflected in spending plans, with significantly fewer planning to increase AI investments compared to last year,\" says Mike Sinoway, CEO of Lucidworks. \"However, above-average reported cost benefits in 2024 could make them more bullish in the coming year. B2B companies and manufacturers have much to gain if they can balance cost and risk to improve efficiency, enhance the buyer experience, and reduce operational costs using generative AI.\"\n\nAmong other findings global AI spending plans are down sharply, with only 63 percent planning increases compared to 93 percent last year.

If you want to know what business leaders and owners think about the economy, just ask them. Based on what they're seeing in running their operations, their opinions could contradict some of the other indicators tracking business conditions.\n\nTo a degree, that's the situation with the latest results of the Leeds Business Confidence Index, which tracks the expectations of business leaders across Colorado and industry sectors. Despite economic indicators signaling continued growth, business leaders remain wary heading into the third quarter.\n\nThe index dropped 3.1 points between the second and third quarters to 50.6, barely above the level that reflects more positive than negative responses to the survey upon which the index is based. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the reading was slightly lower at 49.9.\n\nOf the business leaders who responded to the third quarter survey and provided explanations, 26 percent attributed their expectations to higher interest rates, 21 percent blamed uncertainty over the upcoming election and 17 percent cited their more general sentiments.\n\nAccording to other indicators, the Colorado economy continues to grow. Gross domestic product, the broad measure of goods and services produced in the state, grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.3 percent during the first quarter. Nonfarm payrolls increased 55,400 between May 2023 and May 2024. Inflation for the Denver, Aurora and Lakewood area dropped below 3 percent in May.\n\nHere in Mesa County, the seasonally unadjusted unemployment rate rose a half point between April and May to 4.1 percent as payrolls decreased and the number of people counted among those unsuccessfully looking for work increased.\n\nReal estate sales, yet another important economic indicator, continue to lag behind last year. For June, transactions were down 25.1 percent and dollar volume fell 24.4 percent compared to the same month last year. Higher interest rates on mortgages continue to affect the market. So does uncertainty over those rates, inflation and the impending election.\n\nOn a national level, small business owners remain more pessimistic than optimistic, according to an index based on monthly surveys of members of the National Federation of Independent Business.\n\nThe NFIB Small Business Optimism Index climbed to highest level of the year in June. But at 91.5, the index remained well below its 50-year average of 98 for a 30th consecutive month.\n\nAsked to identify their single most important problem, 21 percent of NFIB members who responded to the June survey cited inflation, 19 percent the quality of labor and 11 percent the cost of labor.\n\nThere's also some good news, though.

For income deciles 2-4, the fall in living standards is on average 8 percent. In their previous Winter 2024 UK Economic Outlook, the NIESR explained how living standards had fallen most sharply for the poorest tenth of UK families since the beginning of the inflationary crisis.\n\n\"Living Standards since the last election\", published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), reports that household income fell for all income deciles except the top two between 2021-22 and 2022-23. After housing costs, the measured fall in median income was 1.5 percent.\n\nThe IFS notes that declines across the previous 2019-2024 parliament were \"mainly driven by a fall in workers' real earnings\". Average pay, adjusted for inflation, is less than it was in 2007. The total growth in average pre-tax pay \"between 2009/10 and 2023/24 is equivalent to what we previously might have expected in about 17 months\".\n\nThis is an indictment of the trade union bureaucracy, which has for decades worked with the employers and successive Conservative and Labour governments to suppress wage demands and the struggle to improve employment terms and working conditions.\n\nAccording to the IFS, stagnating and falling wages were particularly marked in the middle of the income distribution, i.e. the most unionised section of the working class -- skilled trades and white-collar workers. The number of people in working households with incomes that fall beneath the poverty line now exceeds one million and in-work poverty continues to grow.\n\nApproximately 12 million people are in absolute poverty -- a quarter of all children and nearly 15 percent of all those in work. There has been a notable increase in absolute poverty among private renters -- approximately 200,000 more people. The overall figures are a 0.8 percent increase, but, as the IFS notes, this masks the disproportionate impact higher rates of inflation for basic goods have on poorer households. Figures for actual material deprivation, food insecurity and inability to warm one's home are all up significantly.\n\nAgain according to the IFS, the rate of material deprivation rose from 15 percent to 19 percent between 2019-20 and 2022-23, corresponding to an extra 2.8 million people -- returning child and pensioner deprivation rates to the same level they were back in 2010-11. The rate of food insecurity increased from 8 percent to 11 percent over the same period, approximately 2.1 million additional people.\n\nAmong working-age adults, the proportion reporting themselves unable to afford to keep their home warm enough close to tripled from 4 percent in 2019-20 to 11 percent in 2022-23. Those unable to pay to keep their home in a decent state of decoration increased by a third (from 10 percent to 13 percent) and those unable to save just \u00a310 a month by roughly a fifth (from 19 percent to 23 percent).\n\nThis rise in material deprivation finds expression across all age groups, housing tenures, work statuses, household compositions and regions but is especially acute among those with mortgage payments and pensioners.\n\nThe NIESR predicts that the living standards of households in the bottom 40 percent of the population, earning up to \u00a334,000 per year, will not return to pre-pandemic levels for another four years. This is despite an optimistic assumption of a rise of 6 percent in 2024-25 relative to 2023-24.\n\nEven this rise would be distributed unequally: households in the bottom decile are forecast to experience no increase but instead a further 2 percent fall and those in the second decile only a 5 percent increase.\n\nSuch sharp falls in working class living standards over the past five years follow on from the already calamitous decline experienced in the decade-plus since 2008. The attack on living standards was begun by Gordon Brown's Labour government with austerity measures imposed to offset Labour's \u00a31 trillion bailout of the banks and big business after the global financial crash. In 2010, the David Cameron-led Conservative/Liberal Democrats coalition took over where Brown left off, inaugurating the \"age of austerity\".\n\nSuccessive Conservative governments led by May, Johnson, Truss and Sunak deepened this brutal assault, especially to pay for Johnson's billions in subsidies handed to big business during the height of the pandemic.\n\nIn a briefing paper titled \"Seven Key Facts about UK Living Standards\", the IFS write how the poor performance of living standards since the recession after the 2008 global financial crash means that the UK has fallen down the league table relative to other comparable European and North American economies.\n\nIn the 12 years prior to 2008, median working-age incomes rose by over 40 percent in the UK, one of the best-performing countries. In the 12 years post-2007 (up to 2019), income growth was just 6 percent, versus 12 percent for the United States and 16 percent for Germany.\n\nThe collapse in living standards driven by cuts to wages and welfare will continue under the Labour government, the party of big business, \"iron discipline\" on public spending, and total commitment to war and an increase in military budgets.\n\nRead

The polling by Emerson College shows Trump leading among independents with 42 percent of the vote, compared to Biden's 38 percent. This is an inversion from last month when Biden led 43 percent to Trump's 41 percent.\n\nIn addition, Biden's impaired debate performance appears to be dampening Democrat enthusiasm ahead of November's election. Nearly 80 percent of Republican respondents said they were extremely motivated to vote. Meanwhile, just 65 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of independent voters said the same.\n\nThe Emerson poll is one of the most stark data points showing the impact that Biden's public display of cognitive impairment has had on his campaign. In the wake of the June 27 debate, several leading Democratic lawmakers have pushed for Biden to step aside, ostensibly making Kamala Harris the nominee.

However, food prices continued to rise, impacting indices. Retail inflation for agricultural and rural workers remained steady. The annual retail inflation hit a 12-month low.\n\nThe All-India Consumer Price Index-Industrial Workers (CPI-IW) for May rose by 0.5 points, reaching 139.9, according to official data released on Wednesday. Wholesale food prices underwent a month-on-month increase in May, with the Whole Price Index for food climbing from 5.52 percent in April to 7.40 percent in May.\n\nDespite this, year-on-year inflation for May decreased to 3.86 percent, down from 4.42 percent the previous year. In April of the current year, the All-India CPI-IW increased by 0.5 points to 139.4.\n\nYear-over-year inflation for April 2024 was 3.87 percent, a decline from 5.09 percent in April 2023, per official data from the ministry. Pan, Supari, Tobacco, and Intoxicants groups exerted the maximum upward pressure on the current index, contributing 161.2 points, the ministry reported.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers is compiled monthly by the Labour Bureau, a division of the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The data is based on retail prices collected from 317 markets across 88 industrially significant centres in the country. According to the official data, retail inflation for agricultural labourers (CPI-AL) and rural workers (CPI-RL) remained almost unchanged at 7 percent and 7.02 percent, respectively, in May 2024. In the previous month, CPI-AL and CPI-RL were 7.03 percent and 6.96 percent, respectively.\n\nThe data indicated that both food and non-food items -- including vegetables, pulses, wheat, onion, milk, turmeric, ginger, fish, jowar, pan leaf, medications, shirting cloth, sarees, and leather chappals -- drove the indices for May. Additionally, India's retail inflation rate marginally softened in May, even as food prices remained a significant burden. Annual retail inflation reached a 12-month low of 4.75 percent in May.

Another 41 percent say the American dream was once possible for people to achieve - but is not anymore - while the remaining 6 percent say it was never possible.\n\nYounger generations seem to be particularly dismayed by the idea. The majority of people over 50 believed the dream was still possible, but just 43 percent of people aged 30 to 49 thought so. The most pessimistic group was young people aged 18 to 29, just 39 percent of whom believed the dream was still alive. Around 36 percent of the youngest age bracket also felt the American Dream was out of reach for them.\n\nIn a brilliant instance of bias, richer Americans are most likely to buy into the idea. While 64 percent of upper-income Americans say the American dream still exists, only 39 percent of lower-income Americans say the same.\n\nRace is another important variable. A total of 11 percent of Black Americans believe the American Dream was never a reality, while 33 percent believe it's out of reach for them. White people were the most confident in the national ethos, with 55 percent saying it's still possible and just 4 percent saying it was never possible.\n\nThe trends in the new survey, especially in regard to age, could be taken as a reflection of how the US has changed in the past 50 years.\n\nSocial mobility in the US shot up between 1950 and 1980, but has drastically declined since then. Another major blow came in 2007 with the worst global economic meltdown since the Great Depression, leading to widespread job losses and increased wealth inequality.\n\nRecovery was slow and the financial crash's impact continued to linger in the 2010s, a period that the New York Times called the \"Decade of Disillusionment\". This decade was followed by the COVID-19 pandemic and more economic uncertainty in the early 2020s.\n\nThe end result of all this has been a growing gulf between the rich and poor. The US has the highest level of wealth inequality of almost every developed country - and the imbalance is rising. In 1971, 61 percent of Americans lived in middle-class households, but that figure had fallen to 51 percent by 2023. Simultaneously, the number of billionaires in the US has skyrocketed from 66 in 1990 to 748 in 2023.\n\nFaced with these gloomy trends, it's perhaps no surprise that younger Americans have become more disillusioned than their parents and grandparents.", "source": {"uri": "iflscience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFLScience"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rights_and_legal_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural rights and legal rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Truslow_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Truslow Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_Liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_Happiness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All men are created equal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Declaration of Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pew Research Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Distribution of wealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social mobility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Voluntary_Simplicity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Voluntary Simplicity", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/75040/aImg/77400/liberty-meta.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719648", "eventUri": "eng-9719648", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

How Does It Work?\n\nBetween 2018 and 2024, the average principal and interest payment for homes purchased in Alaska increased by 52 percent, the study released on June 19 found. Newsweek contacted AHFC for comment by phone on Wednesday morning.\n\nHigher mortgage rates are likely to be another factor in making homes unaffordable for many aspiring buyers in the state, on top of relatively high home prices.\n\nAccording to the latest Redfin data, the median sale price of a home in Alaska was $388,400 in May, up 2.2 percent compared to a year earlier. In May 2022, it was $363,000.

But the average month of supply is only two months -- far from the six months that is considered enough for the market to turn in favor of buyers.\n\nThe situation isn't any easier for people renting in the state. Since 2018, average rents have increased by 24 percent, reaching an average of $1,325 statewide in 2024, up from $1,250 a year earlier.\n\nAll seven communities analyzed by the AHFC experts saw rents increases, including the Municipality of Anchorage (+7.84 percent), Fairbanks North Star Borough (+4.17 percent), Juneau (+3.85 percent), Kenai Peninsula Borough (+4.71 percent), Ketchikan Gateway Borough (+8.41 percent), Kodiak (+20.83 percent), and Matanuska Susitna Borough (+6.38 percent).\n\nDaniel Delfino, the director of planning and program development for AHFC, told Alaska News Source that the housing situation in Alaska is complicated, with \"a lot of things moving at the same time.\"\n\n\"We don't have a 'it's this' or 'it's that' answer anymore to some of the housing challenges that people are facing,\" Delfino said. \"It's an expensive place to build, Alaska.

The growth is driven primarily by intra-regional travel -- up 10 percent compared to 2023 -- and a significant influx of visitors from long-haul markets in Asia Pacific (+11 percent) and the United States (+21 percent).\n\n\"Increases in flight searches and ticket bookings indicate a robust interest in European destinations, despite the lingering effects of global economic challenges -- due in part to major events taking place during the summer season,\" an announcement by ForwardKeys notes.\n\nCities like Munich (+37 percent), which benefits from key sporting events this summer, are seeing significant growth. The pattern is balanced across European subregions, with substantial increases throughout the continent including Vienna (+23 percent), Edinburgh (+19 percent), Madrid (+16 percent) and Venice (+16 percent).\n\nWhile medium-length stays continue to represent the largest share of intra-regional arrivals (63 percent), short trips of one to three nights show the highest growth over 2023 at 23 percent, accounting for 16 percent of all stays. Long trips -- over two weeks -- see more modest growth at 5 percent.\n\n\"These granular shifts -- closely tied to specific event dates -- reveal the importance of major events in powering growth even amidst economic downturns, as demand remains high for 'once-in-a-lifetime' experiences,\" ForwardKeys says.\n\n\"As the season unfolds, European destinations are well-positioned to capitalise on these trends,\" says ForwardKeys.", "source": {"uri": "news.gtp.gr", "dataType": "news", "title": "GTP Headlines"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gtp_editing_team@news.gtp.gr", "name": "Gtp Editing Team", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Image Galleries", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://news.gtp.gr/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ForwardKeys_20240705-Europe-summer-trends_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719648", "eventUri": "eng-9719648", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

The unemployment rate rose slightly from four percent to 4.1 percent, the highest since November 2021, largely due to 277,000 new job seekers entering the market.\n\nMany did not find employment immediately. Additionally, job growth estimates for April and May were revised down by 111,000 combined, and average hourly pay only increased by 0.3 percent from May, marking the smallest annual rise since June 2021 at 3.9 percent. This modest pay growth aligns with the Federal Reserve's efforts to curb inflation, with many economists predicting a rate cut in September.\n\nNotably, the job gains were concentrated in government roles and healthcare and social assistance, sectors that do not fully reflect the economy's core strength. Job growth from April to June averaged 177,000 per month, the lowest since January 2021, but still a solid figure.\n\n\"Both May and June hiring was above 200,000 even after revisions, and the trajectory looks stable,\" said Eric Winograd, U.S. economist at AllianceBernstein. \"The best available evidence is that the labor market remains strong and that any deceleration remains modest.\"\n\nThe state of the economy is a significant concern for voters as the presidential campaign heats up. Despite consistent hiring, minimal layoffs, and cooling inflation, many Americans remain frustrated by high prices, often blaming President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's series of rate hikes aimed at controlling inflation have shown mixed results. The U.S. GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.4 percent from January to March, the slowest in nearly two years, and consumer spending, which drives 70 percent of economic activity, rose by only 1.5 percent last quarter. Job openings have also declined since peaking in March 2022.\n\nDespite the slowdown in hiring, layoffs remain low, providing workers with a sense of job security. Hal Lawton, CEO of Tractor Supply, highlighted ongoing pressure to increase wages due to high living costs. His company, based in Brentwood, Tennessee, pays workers over US$16 per hour on average and continues to feel the pinch of the tight labor market.\n\n\"You have got a tight labor market, and frontline workers are feeling the pinch of their budgets,\" Lawton said. \"They are still out there looking for those wage increases.\"\n\nThe Fed's interest rate hikes over the past two years, the most aggressive in decades, have not led to the expected recession. Instead, the economy and job market have shown remarkable resilience.\n\nInflation has decreased from a peak of 9.1 percent in 2022 to 3.3 percent, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting recent slowdowns in price increases. However, he emphasized that further evidence of progress toward the Fed's two percent inflation target is needed before considering rate cuts.\n\nChris Thomas, an engineering manager in Christiansburg, Virginia, experienced the changed job market firsthand. After being laid off from a tech startup in April, his job search took nearly three months, compared to just one month in 2021 when the tech industry was booming. \"This is a very, very different job market than the one we had three years ago,'' he said.", "source": {"uri": "europesun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "europesun.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While the index for non-oil activities increased by 12.8 percent, supported by an increase in all non-oil economic activities except for water activities,\" said GASTAT in the report.\n\nThe analysis revealed that manufacturing activities in the Kingdom witnessed a growth of 8.2 percent in May compared to the same month of the previous year, while electricity, gas, steam, and air conditioning supply operations rose by 6.6 percent during the same period.", "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secondary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Vision_2030", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Vision 2030"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manufacturing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coke (fuel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barrel (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Specialties", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Specialties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2024/07/10/4459786-1679026342.jpg?itok=pEBIf55g", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719648", "eventUri": "eng-9719648", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

An impressive 93 percent of those recently surveyed say they are concerned about forms of online identity fraud. The Dutch are the most concerned, although they are also less likely to be victims of cybercrime due to a more vigilant attitude.\n\nAccording to research among 4,000 consumers in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the Netherlands commissioned by identity and access specialist Okta, more than half of those surveyed have changed their online behaviour in the past year. The main reason being increasing cyber attacks and the growing role of AI. In the Netherlands, 65 percent of consumers are concerned that AI is making the online environment less secure, the highest percentage among the countries surveyed.\n\nIn addition, 60 percent of the Dutch think that AI increases the likelihood of identity theft. This makes them more reluctant to embrace AI for online security than other Europeans. While in Germany, France and the UK 'only' a quarter of consumers feel uncomfortable when companies deploy AI for login security, this percentage is much higher for the Netherlands, at 41 percent.\n\nStolen bank credentials as the biggest fear\n\nPlundered online bank accounts remain the biggest source of cyber anxiety for European consumers. In the UK, this is the biggest fear for 60 percent of consumers, compared to 59 percent in France and Germany and 49 percent in the Netherlands. In terms of attractive targets for criminals, Brits are particularly concerned about the security of their social media accounts. The Dutch, on the other hand, are more concerned about the security of DigiD, the government's login system. Europeans are considerably less concerned about work accounts: only 2 percent consider this a favourable target for criminals.\n\nThe Dutch' worries about their digital security shows in their handling of passwords. Only 8 percent use the same password for all accounts. This is considerably lower than in France, for example, where this number sits at 16 percent. Almost half (49 percent) of the Dutch use unique passwords or a password manager. This care seems to be paying off. Only 33 percent of Dutch people say they have ever been hacked, compared with the UK (38 percent), France (39 percent) and Germany (41 percent).\n\nSecurity as a shared responsibility\n\nIt is also striking that 31 percent of Dutch people think digital security is a shared responsibility for consumers, businesses, and the government. This view is slightly less widespread in the rest of Europe.\n\nMark van Leeuwen, Regional Vice President Benelux at Okta, emphasizes the need for a robust security strategy: \"With the ever-changing landscape - and with it changing threats -, and the rise of AI, it has never been more important to get cyber security right. Companies must move quickly to ensure they have the security strategy and robust culture in place to protect their data.\"\n\nThe survey was commissioned by Okta and conducted by market research firm Cint. 4,054 consumers were surveyed. These include 1,019 in the United Kingdom, 1,021 in Germany, 1,012 in France and 1,001 in the Netherlands.\n\nAlso read: Okta CEO: \"We've been at cyber war for some time\"", "source": {"uri": "techzine.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Techzine Europe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Login"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okta,_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Okta, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Identity theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dutch people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benelux", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benelux"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyberwarfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Password manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products and Tools", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.techzine.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1577071933.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719648", "eventUri": "eng-9719648", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Moreover, the slowdown has been attributed to the authorities' shift towards an inflation targeting model and a flexible exchange rate regime.\n\nHowever, analysts have warned of potential risks that could disrupt this downward trajectory. These include increases in administered prices such as fuel, medicine, fertilizers, and natural gas.\n\n\"Egypt is going through 30 months of intensive economic reforms that are expected to include repricing of subsidized electricity and fuel, which poses major challenges to taming inflation,\" said Mona Bedeir, analyst, Al Baraka bank.\n\nFood and beverage prices rose by 30.8 percent year-on-year in June and 3 percent month-on-month. This was driven in part by a 300 percent increase in the price of subsidized bread that took effect on June 1. However, the impact was limited by bread's relatively light weight in the index, accounting for around 1 percent of the food basket, and offset by disinflation of other food items and a favorable base effect.\n\nRead more: Egypt approves $200 million in energy projects with foreign, national companies\n\nWhile the base-year effect is still strong enough to absorb some of the expected price hikes, Bedeir warned that unexpected problems could still surprise policymakers.

But they are still negotiating for raises across the board.\n\nDuring their 12th negotiation session with the district this week, the CSEA requested a 10 percent salary increase this year and a 5 percent increase next year -- a proposal that matches the recent tentative agreement reached with the Santa Barbara Teachers Association (SBTA).\n\nThe district countered with 10 percent this year, 3 percent next year (with the potential for an additional increase if property tax revenue is more than 5 percent), and another 2 percent in 2026.\n\nCSEA also requested longevity pay for employees -- meaning a 4 percent raise at 20 years, 5 percent at 25 years, and 6 percent at 30 years -- but the district rejected it.\n\nThe CSEA's next negotiation sessions are July 15 and 19.\n\nAs for teachers, the school community is waiting with bated breath to hear whether union membership will accept the tentative agreement on wages or reject it outright. As of July 2, SBTA President Hozby Galindo said the vote was still \"underway.\"\n\nBecause that agreement has not been ratified, it was not included in the district's 2024-25 budget, which was approved on June 25.\n\nMuch of the district's funding comes from local property taxes, which, on average, has provided the district with a 4-5 percent increase in funds in past years. However, according to the district, the Santa Barbara County Tax Assessor has projected a decrease to 3.75 percent in the coming year.\n\nLeaving out any potential wage agreements with either union, the budget still includes a projected deficit due to \"increasing costs and a slower rise than usual in revenues from local and state funds,\" according to the district.\n\nThe full budget is available on the agenda.\n\nTo view all past negotiations updates from the district, visit the district's website here.", "source": {"uri": "independent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Santa Barbara Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "callie_fausey@independent.com", "name": "Callie Fausey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_School_Employees_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California School Employees Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara_Unified_School_District", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara Unified School District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Service_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Service Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/school-district-sign.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719648", "eventUri": "eng-9719648", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "dateEnd": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 1411, "textEnd": 1425}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 1602, "textEnd": 1608}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 1798, "textEnd": 1805}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

(WECT) - The Brunswick County Board of Education on July 9 approved the 2024-2029 strategic plan for the district.\n\nStrategic priorities for the plan are student success, student services, community engagement, talent development and effective and efficient operations.\n\nStudent Success\n\nBy 2029, the district wants all of its schools to meet or exceed growth, compared to about 42 percent of schools that meet or exceed growth as of the most recent measure. To make this happen, the district plans on adopting core curricula for all state-tested subjects in K-12, provide professional development for new curricula, implement systematic classroom walkthroughs to monitor the quality of instruction and give feedback and more.\n\nIn the next five years, the district also wants 100 percent of its students to have access to work-based learning opportunities. For this, the district plans to audit current Career and Technical Education program enrollment, require professional development for counselors and teachers on teaching students about CTE pathways, maximizing the use of academic career planning tools and increasing the number of work-based learning opportunities available.\n\nStudent Services\n\nThe district wants every student to have access to a multi-tiered system of support by 2029. BCS' plan says it plans to provide professional development on Mental Health First Aid and connecting every student to a caring adult and make sure mental health needs are met with support. Leaders also want less instructional time lost due to disciplinary issues and for each school counseling program to implement best practices with a BCS-developed rubric by the end of the 2028-2029 school year.\n\nThe plan aims to decrease chronic absenteeism from 32 percent to 5 percent, decrease threat assessment and discipline threats from 118 to around 81 and decreasing the short-term suspensions from 7897 to around 5804.\n\nCommunity Engagement\n\nOn this point, the district aims to get more internships, apprenticeships and partnerships with Brunswick Community College and the UNC System.\n\nMetrics for this include increasing the number of internships, pre-apprenticeships and apprenticeships from six to 26 by 2029, increasing businesses offering internship from 0 to 30 and increasing College and Career Promise participation from 37 percent to 48 percent.\n\nTalent Development\n\nTo help gain and keep talented staff, BCS wants to implement a formal annual recruitment and retention plan, providing a competitive salary, develop a grow-your-own program to promote a local employee pipeline and conducting a salary study to find a competitive pay plan. The district wants to make a program to support beginning teachers and offer quarterly professional development sessions to new teachers.\n\nMetrics include increasing the percent of certified positions filled from 89 percent to 100 percent, increasing the number of positions filled from 93 percent to 100 percent and increase the grow-your-own program hires from none at all to 10. As for the beginning teacher program, the district hopes to bring retention rates for beginning teachers from 96 percent to 100 percent.\n\nAdditionally, BCS wants to implement a program to recognize and reward high-performing staff via professional development, a supportive workplace culture and working conditions, making a growth track for classified employees and implementing a local working conditions survey. The plan outlines a hope to implement practices that protect employees' personal time and planning periods.\n\nFor metrics, the school wants to increase retention rates from 86 percent to 100 percent and local survey completions from none at all to around 70 percent.\n\nEffective and Efficient Operations\n\nThe district wants to make sure all schools are secure and welcoming environments by implementing modern financial systems to support efficient reporting, developing facility plans for development and new construction, ensure operations functions with cost-effective measures and making all areas of facilities meet requirements like fire codes, state insurance inspections and safety and handicap requirements.\n\nMetrics include keeping the number of financial audits with findings at 0 and increasing the school's transportation efficiency rating from 88 to 94.", "source": {"uri": "wect.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.wect.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick_County,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brunswick County, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brunswick County, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vocational education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u201312", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K\u201312"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WECT", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WECT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apprenticeship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Threat assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(punishment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (punishment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Best practice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_counselor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "School counselor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absenteeism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Absenteeism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fire safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Organizational culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://gray-wect-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/SEPCBRHD4NBOTGM3YIBTVFVDGE.bmp?auth=2efd2bd574898b06b946f6baac9e50118395559f0eb2e1c9e2bae8f4c0c3375d&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719648", "eventUri": "eng-9719648", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brunswick County, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 75, "textEnd": 81}], "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

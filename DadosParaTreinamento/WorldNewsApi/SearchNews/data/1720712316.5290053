{"id": 231982200, "title": "Today&#8217;s weather: Cloudy and muggy, with a chance of isolated showers", "text": "Sunday is looking like a nice day for many events. The morning will start out with a couple of clouds, and the cloud cover will increase throughout the day. It does get a little bit muggier due to the building moisture ahead of our next cold front. A weak cold front will pass us by which will bring some isolated showers and storms later in the evening. It will be warmer with highs near 90. Despite the dewpoints starting to creep up a bit, it will still be on the comfortable side. Expect comfortable conditions on Monday. Skies will turn partly cloudy with highs in the low 80s. Much milder air arrives to the area on Tuesday. You can expect highs in the upper 70s and low 80s. Humidity will be on the rise Thursday and so will temperatures. Highs will warm to the mid 80s under partly cloudy skies. Scattered storms will be possible to end the work week. Highs will be back in the upper 80s.", "summary": "Sunday morning will start out with a couple of clouds, and the cloud cover will increase throughout the day.", "url": "https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/06/09/todays-weather-cloudy-and-muggy-with-a-chance-of-isolated-showers/", "image": "https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/16x9weathercardfog2-e1713274945100.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:43:21", "author": "April Loveland", "authors": ["April Loveland"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.041}

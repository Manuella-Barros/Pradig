THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean KilpatrickOTTAWA - Jewish leaders in Canada are warning of a national crisis as the number of hateful incidents targeting Jews doubled in one year. B'Nai Brith Canada says it documented nearly 5,800 incidents of antisemitism in 2023, including acts of violence, harassment and vandalism. In 2022 there were fewer than 2,800 such incidents. There were 77 violent incidents reported in 2023, more than three times the 25 that were recorded in 2022. Richard Robertson, the group's director of research, says it is the largest number of antisemitic incidents in this country since his organization began tracking the problem in 1982. And he says it has left Jewish Canadians feeling alone, ostracized and unwelcome in their own country.

That included firebombings and shootings at Jewish schools, synagogues and community centres.\n\n\"This means that on average, a Jewish Canadian was threatened or assaulted every fourth day in 2023,\" he said. \"These figures are horrifying and warrant an immediate action in response from all societal stakeholders, both governmental and non governmental.\"\n\nThere were 462 acts of vandalism in 2023.\n\nThe vast majority of recorded incidents -- 4,847 -- took the form of online harassment. Messages included threats that \"you and your family are going to die,\" expressing glee at the deaths caused by Hamas on Oct. 7, and declaring an intention to eradicate Israel or Jews.\n\nMore than half of the incidents happened in the three months after Oct. 7, when Hamas terrorists invaded Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostage. Israel responded with force, launching a relentless air attack on the Gaza Strip that has displaced more than a million people, killed an estimated 35,000 people, and inflicted a humanitarian crisis with shortages of food, medicine and water.\n\nThe events have had an effect in Jewish and Muslim communities around the world.\n\nThe total number of antisemitic incidents in Canada last year was the largest recorded in a single year since B'nai Brith began producing an annual tally in 1982. The numbers parallel reports from several municipal police forces, including Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver, about an exponential increase in hate-motivated incidents targeting Jews last year.\n\nRobertson said the \"aggressive rise in antisemitism\" has left Canadian Jews feeling dehumanized, \"ostracized and abandoned.\"\n\n\"The systemic nature of the antisemitism has forced Canadian Jews to question the continued vitality of the nation's Jewish communities,\" he said. \"For perhaps the first time there was a genuine concern that the Jewish Canadian narrative ... is at risk of being subject to erasure.\"\n\nPoilievre said Monday that given how long it has been since the Holocaust, some memories have started to fade and some of the same \"totalitarian ideologies\" that drove the Nazis in Germany, have returned \"with the same hateful rhetoric, and in some cases, the same precursor actions playing themselves out today.\"\n\nPoilievre pointed to antisemitic rhetoric on university campuses and the targeting of Jewish buildings and homes and said the result is that Jewish Canadians are \"making the heart-wrenching decision\" not to wear a star of David symbol or a kippah, or to take down the mezuzah on their door frame.\n\n\"In Canada it is absolutely unacceptable that you should be faced with this dilemma,\" he said.\n\nPoilievre said Jewish Canadians must be allowed to live \"fearlessly and proudly\" and that \"it is the responsibility of every Canadian, Jewish or otherwise, to stand with your right to do that.\"\n\nTrudeau said in his speech that the Oct. 7 attack on Israel was the largest mass killing of Jews since the Holocaust, and took aim at those who use \"Zionism\" to express their hatred.\n\n\"In a country like Canada, it should be and it must be safe to declare oneself a Zionist, Jewish or not,\" he said.\n\n\"Zionism is not a dirty word or something anyone should be targeted for agreeing with. It is the belief at its simplest that Jewish people, like all peoples, have the right to determine their own future.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 6, 2024.", "source":

It is an attack on Canadian values and a threat to our multicultural, diverse society,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"We urge people to think seriously about what this spike in antisemitic incidents says about the direction in which our society is heading.\"\n\nRobertson called the figures \"horrifying\" and \"warrant an immediate action and response\" from both government and non-governmental \"societal stakeholders.\"\n\nHe said underlies the numbers was concerning.\n\n\"It is what cannot be directly extrapolated from the numbers that is perhaps most ominous,\" he said.\n\n\"The result of the aggressive rise in antisemitism is that Jews from coast to coast after being subjected to dehumanizing levels of hate over the course of the previous year, have been left feeling ostracized and abandoned,\" he told a press gallery.\n\n\"The systemic nature of the antisemitism has forced Canadian Jews to question the continued vitality of the nation's Jewish communities... perhaps for the first time, there is a genuine concern that the Jewish Canadian narrative, a proud history inextricably linked to modern Canada and the betterment and advancement of our society, is at risk of being subject to erasure.\"\n\nHorrifying \"notable examples\" mentioned by B'nai Brith in a press release about the 2023 audit include that \"a Jewish student in the Lower Mainland (Langley) of B.C. was physically assaulted by classmates while being taunted by antisemitic epithets\" and that a Manitoba Jewish student \"was confronted by classmates doing the 'Sieg Heil.'\"\n\nIn the audit, B'nai Brith says it took care to show the impacts on Canadian Jews from a confrontation between Israel and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terrorists, in May of 2023.\n\n\"When Israel is attacked, the repercussions extend far beyond its borders. Twice in 2023, due to a foreign conflict, Canada's Jewish community was unduly subjected to scapegoating and hostility. The actions of a foreign government were used to justify the targeting of Jewish schools, houses of worship, institutions, businesses, and persons.\"\n\nRobertson said it was alarming how \"the pervasiveness with which antisemitism permeated into the fabric of our society\" in the past year.\n\n\"But just as troubling is that the dramatic increase in antisemitism cannot solely be attributed to one factor or incident,\" he said.\n\n\"Antisemitism was omnipresent in Canada in 2023. Separate conflicts in Israel, first in May and June, and then Oct. 7 to end of year, did produce an increase in the number of antisemitic incidents.\n\n\"When there is unrest in Israel, Jewish Canadians suffer unduly,\" he said, though he noted foreign conflicts are \"not solely responsible for the surge in antisemitism in 2023.\"\n\nIn September, he noted, antisemitism had spiked following the celebration in the House of Commons of Yaroslav Hunka, a 98-year-old Ukrainian-Canadian who served in the Nazi SS Galizien division during the Second World War. (The 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, sometimes called SS Galizien and SS Galichina or Galicia, was founded by Heinrich Himmler in 1943, and soldiers swore an oath to Hitler.)\n\nRobertson said that the 2023 report also found there's an increasing use of Artificial Intelligence to \"produce and promote\" antisemitic incidents, and noted that university campuses had become places Jewish students and staff were being \"forced to cope\" with the impacts of anti-Israel rhetoric on their academic environments.\n\n\"What is clear is that the situation is untenable and requires urgent intervention,\" he said.\n\n\"As Canadians we must collectively act to ensure that the dramatic rise in antisemitism witnessed in 2023 does not intensify in 2024. We are on a precipice, and cannot allow our society to fall into the abyss. The absurd rise in antisemitism is not reflective of our shared morals and values.\n\n\"Canada, we can do better.\"\n\nSpeaking at a ceremony Monday to commemorate Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day, at the National Holocaust Monument in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called out rising antisemitism in Canada.\n\nAfter he thanked the Holocaust survivors present at the ceremony for their strength and commitment to sharing their stories with future generations, Trudeau said there had been a \"disturbing increase\" in antisemitism \"to a scale we had not witnessed for generations.\"\n\n\"Windows of synagogues have been broken and shot at... Jewish stores vandalized ... all of these acts open wounds of painful chapters in our collective history,\" said Trudeau to the crowd at the Holocaust Memorial.\n\n\"There are people out there who are still denying the Holocaust. There are people out there who deny what happened on Oct. 7. And I know that too often over the past months, Jewish Canadians have felt and have been isolated and unsafe in their communities. People have felt unsafe to live openly Jewish lives in Canada. And that's not right.\"\n\nHe called behaviour targeting Jews, including Zionist Jews, unacceptable.\n\n\"In a country like Canada, it should be and it must be safe to declare oneself a Zionist, Jewish or not,\" said the prime minister.\n\n\"Zionism is not a dirty word or something anyone should be targeted for agreeing with. It is the belief, at its simplest, that Jewish people, like all peoples, have the right to determine their own future.\n\n\"Threatening, harassing, or excluding Canadians, because of their faith, their identity, or because they support the Jewish people's right to self determination in their ancestral homeland is absolutely unacceptable,\" said Trudeau.\n\n\"You can be a Zionist and strongly support the creation of a Palestinian state living in peace and security alongside Israel, a view I know is shared by many in the Jewish community, and across Canada,\" he said. \"It's my belief, too.\"\n\nWith a nod to some of the tense demonstrations taking place in Canadian cities, and around the many encampments at Canadian universities like McGill, University of Toronto, University of British Columbia and University of Ottawa, (among others in BC and Ontario), Trudeau addressed popular rhetoric in pro-Palestinian protests that can veer or may be veering into antisemitic rhetoric.\n\n\"Antisemitism in any form, whether it's on the internet or in certain chants we've been hearing is unacceptable,\" he said. A current popular chants characterizes all Zionists as \"racists\" and \"terrorists.\"\n\n\"We all know that antisemitism wasn't new 80 years ago and it didn't stop in 1945,\" said Trudeau.\n\nBefore he concluded, followed by remarks from Debra Lyons, the current special envoy on Holocaust remembrance and combating antisemitism, Trudeau referenced the former envoy, Irwin Cotler.\n\nCotler taught him that \"antisemitism in the canary in the coal mine of global hatred,\" Trudeau said.\n\n\"The work of combating antisemitism should not fall to Jewish community to solve alone. It is up to everyone to take on this challenge, all Canadians together.\"", "source": {"uri": "thecjn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Canadian Jewish News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This represents a 109 per cent increase over 2022, when there were 2,769 incidents.\n\n\"The absolute number and the increasing number of antisemitic incidents in 2023 are astonishing,\" B'nai Brith legal counsel David Matas said at an Ottawa press conference.\n\n\"Whatever one thinks of the Israeli responses to (the Hamas) terrorist attacks, Jews in Canada have had nothing to do with them. To attack Jews in Canada for these responses is straight bigotry.\"\n\nThe bulk of the reported incidents -- 4,847 -- took place online in the form of harassment. B'nai Brith links much of the increase in online antisemitism to the proliferation of images and videos created with artificial intelligence.\n\nFor offline incidents, B'nai Brith says it tracked 77 reports of physical violence compared with 25 the year prior. In-person harassment and vandalism - ranging from instances of graffiti to arson - all saw increases over 2022 at 405 and 462 incidents reported, respectively.\n\nAccording to B'nai Brith, in-person harassment is up 42 per cent and vandalism saw a 14 per cent increase.\n\nAll of these real-world incidents reported through the audit saw significant increases after October, following the Hamas attack on Israel and Israel's military campaign in Gaza, which has been the focus of rallies and protests in the months since.\n\nFor example, the report noted, a Montreal Jewish school was shot at twice in November and two Jewish institutions in the same city were firebombed.\n\n\"The result of the aggressive rise in antisemitism is that Jews from coast to coast, after being subjected to dehumanizing levels of hate over the course of the previous year, have been left feeling ostracized and abandoned,\" Robert Richardson, B'nai Brith director of research and advocacy, said.\n\nThis goes in line with data collected by Statistics Canada in its annual look at police-reported hate crimes. Since 2019, Jews have been the most targeted religious group based on police data, with 502 incidents in 2022.\n\nMuslims are the second most targeted group, with 108 police-reported hate crimes in 2022. According to a November 2023 Senate report on Islamophobia, an additional 1,723 crimes were motivated by racial or ethnic hatred involving Muslim people in 2021.\n\nThe B'nai Brith audit uses the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism when logging incidents. This broad definition includes elements like calling for the harm or death of Jews, denying or downplaying the Holocaust, holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the Israeli state and claiming the existence of Israel is a racist endeavour.\n\nTo gather figures for its audit, B'nai Brith gathers information on police-reported incidents collected from 29 contacted police agencies in Canada, and reports submitted through their online platforms and anti-hate hotline.\n\nB'nai Brith tracked fluctuating reports of online hate, with June being the most active month last year.\n\n\"It's definitely a problem. One of the causes of this acceleration of antisemitism. But we have to realize artificial intelligence ... like a lot of technology, is both a benefit and a harm,\" Matas said.\n\n\"With each new technology, as we come to appreciate the benefit, we have to put in the safeguards against the harm. And we have not done that yet.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence can create content rapidly and cheaply, and has been increasingly identified by security officials as a growing challenge when it comes to tackling misinformation and online hate.\n\nMatas said he would like to see the Liberals' Online Harms Act adopted \"with improvements\" as soon as possible. He added that B'nai Brith will be making submissions to the government on what they would like to see in the bill.\n\nBroadly, the Online Harms Act looks to create an internet complaint mechanism, bring in steep penalties for hate crimes and protect children from potentially harmful content.\n\nOntario Liberal MP Marco Mendicino appeared alongside B'nai Brith and said the Online Harms Act isn't the only tool that should be looked at to address virtual antisemitism.\n\n\"I think that it is equally important, if not more important, to ensure that we are educating young Canadians about the Holocaust and what antisemitism looks like today in the 21st century,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, deputy Conservative leader Melissa Lantsman, who is Jewish, argued the bill is not the appropriate mechanism.\n\n\"We are not going to solve this by criminalizing speech, particularly having a government decide what you can say and see on the internet,\" Lantsman said.\n\n\"Where the focus needs to be after this report must be in making sure that the physical security of institutions, of synagogues, of schools, of businesses, of people in the streets, who find themselves in the middle of vile, hateful demonstrations are kept safe. We do not have a law problem in this country. We have an enforcement problem.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

{"id": 231287566, "title": "YouTuber who helped ID first 'Son of Sam' victim pushing \u2018very interested\u2019 cops to find more bodies", "text": "There may be others. The citizen sleuth who recently helped police identify the Son of Sam\u2019s first true victim is now telling \u201cvery interested\u201d cops to look for additional bodies around two key dates \u2014 Dec. 14, 1976 and Feb. 25, 1977, he told The Post this week. That\u2019s when serial killer David Berkowitz authored and dated two twisted letters \u2014 part of the \u201capartment writings\u201d found by police in Berkowitz\u2019s Yonkers digs following his Aug. 10, 1977 arrest \u2014 according to YouTuber Manny Grossman. It was Grossman\u2019s dogged detective work that led to the stunning revelation splashed across The Post front page last week that the 44.-caliber killer had one more victim than previously known, his first, and that his deadly spree had begun three months earlier than believed. NYPD cold-case detectives concluded last week that Wendy Savino, now 87, was the first official victim of the \u201cSon of Sam.\u201d \u201cI identified a pattern where Berkowitz would go crazy about dogs barking, he would write a letter and go absolutely nuts,\u201d Grossman told The Post. The 51-year-old Bronx resident added chillingly, \u201cThere\u2019s two letters in there. Both say \u2018Today\u2019s the day I will go and spill blood for Sam Carr.\u201d Berkowitz believed a demon lived in and spoke through a black Labrador retriever owned by his neighbor, Sam Carr. Grossman believes there is an \u201cestablished pattern\u201d of Berkowitz \u201cwriting these letters, dating these letters and then going out and shooting.\u201d The YouTuber \u201cpresented the letters\u201d to Bronx homicide detectives on May 28, the day before investigators interviewed Berkowitz at Shawangunk Correctional Facility in upstate Ulster County. \u201cThey were very interested in the theory. They wrote down the dates for sure. What they did afterwards I do not know,\u201d Grossman said. The NYPD did not respond to questions from The Post regarding additional Berkowitz victims. Berkowitz previously left clues to his carnage in his letters. Virginia Voskerichian \u2014 victim No. 9 and fatality No. 3 \u2014 was 20 years old when she was shot and killed by Berkowitz around 7:30 p.m. on March 8, 1977 on a quiet street in Forest Hills, Queens. In a letter dated that same day at 9:15 a.m., Berkowitz wrote, \u201cThe dog is screaming for fresh blood and meat to quench his thirst and pangs of fresh blood\u201d and later rages, \u201cToday the demon has not stopped for a moment. How much blood does he want me to spill for him?\u201d Grossman pored over online files at thepeoplevsdavidberkowitz.com, which claims to be the \u201clargest public repository of investigatory files and documents\u201d relating to the \u201cSon of Sam\u201d case. The treasure trove of information was obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and public records, the website says. Grossman cold-called a retired Berkowitz detective in Yonkers and subsequently teamed up with the lawman\u2019s son, Mike Lorenzo, also a retired Yonkers investigator. \u201cHe started showing me his dad\u2019s files and we just established a great working relationship and friendship and it led to a new analysis of the case,\u201d Grossman explained. \u201cIt was really Mike Lorenzo who came up with the philosophical framework that Wendy Savino fit. That Berkowitz was a stalking sniper who had other victims.\u201d The Manhattan-born, Riverdale-bred Grossman said he \u201cgrew up in a journalistic household.\u201d His dad, Jim, was a \u201cbig New York City PR guy\u201d who had reporting stints with the Wall Street Journal, Charlotte Observer and San Juan Star. \u201cAll I ever wanted to be was a rock drummer,\u201d Grossman laughed. The landscaper confessed he only started looking into the unsolved Savino shooting because he had time on his hands during COVID. Grossman is content with his 15 minutes of fame. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to be part of their investigation, nor do I particularly want to,\u201d he said of NYPD probers. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the way they handled the Savino case.\u201d In today\u2019s high-tech world, the Son of Sam would have had a limited body count, Grossman theorized. \u201cIt could never happen today because he might be able to do one, maybe two, but he would get photographed everywhere . . . especially crossing the bridges of New York City.\u201d", "summary": "The citizen sleuth who recently help police identify the \"Son of Sam\" David Berkowitz's first true victim is now telling \u201cvery interested\u201d cops to look for additional bodies around two key dates.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/youtuber-who-helped-id-son-of-sams-first-victim-helping-very-interested-cops-find-more-victims/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/240605-manny-grossman-bronx-ny-83411047.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:53:02", "author": "Dean Balsamini,Tina Moore", "authors": ["Dean Balsamini", "Tina Moore"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.207}

It is believed she may have been there for two days\n\nA 50 year old woman, found chained to a tree in a dense forest in Maharashtra's Sindhudurg district, was carrying a photocopy of a US passport among her possessions. Identified as Lalita Kayi, the woman also had an Aadhaar card indicating an address in Tamil Nadu.\n\nHowever, her passport is no longer valid, leading authorities to verify these documents to confirm her nationality.\n\nThe chilling discovery was made by a shepherd from the Sonurli hamlet, who heard the woman's cries for help on Saturday night and quickly alerted the police.

Due to her mental and physical conditions, she was later moved to Goa Medical College for specialised treatment.\n\nThe officials have stated that the woman is not in immediate danger, but her treating physicians have identified mental health issues. During their investigation, it was revealed that she had prescription drugs in her possession.\n\nIn the meantime, the Foreigners Regional Registration office is working closely with the police on this matter. Initial information suggests that the woman has been living in India for the past ten years.\n\nSadly, due to her weakened condition, worsened by recent heavy rainfall in the area, she is currently unable to give a statement. It's also unclear how long she was tied to the tree, but suspicions are rising that her husband, who hails from Tamil Nadu, may have played a part in the incident.\n\nFollowing these developments, police teams have been sent to Tamil Nadu, Goa, and other places as part of the ongoing investigation to find her family. \"When we found her, she was severely dehydrated.

The motive behind her Mumbai visit is still unclear, with police investigating her past, including her marriage to an Indian man in Tamil Nadu. The Sindhudurg police are probing into the case for further details.\n\nA 50-year-old American woman, identified as Lalita Kayi, was discovered tied to a tree with an iron chain in a forest in Maharashtra's Sindhudurg district. The woman had recently visited Mumbai in June, but the motive behind her visit remains unclear, according to police reports on Wednesday.\n\nSindhudurg police have gathered information regarding Kayi, including her origin in the U.S. Various police teams are currently verifying these details. Kayi reportedly came to Tamil Nadu a decade ago for yoga and meditation, eventually marrying an Indian man, staying with him for several years, and obtaining an Aadhaar card. After a dispute with her husband, she resided in Goa before traveling to Mumbai in June.\n\nPolice are still verifying the details of Kayi's Mumbai visit and her activities there.

Concurrently, the police have filed a case of attempted murder against the former husband of the American woman.

She was later referred to a more advanced medical facility in Sindhudurg's Oros after the primary treatment was taken care of.\n\nThe doctors treating her said that the woman seemed to be suffering from psychiatric problems and communicated with them by writing about her health problems on a piece of paper. She has ended up in a terrible state physically and mentally due to the past circumstances that have unfolded with her. A video from inside the hospital showed the woman writing about her condition, highlighting that she was without food for 40 days. In her written message, she explicitly claimed that her husband had tied her in the forest after a quarrel.\n\nSpeaking to the media, a Maharashtra Police official said that no FIR has been registered in connection with the matter yet, but a probe had been launched.\"The woman is not yet in a position to give her statement. The woman is weak as she has not eaten anything for a couple of days and also as the area experienced heavy rains. We don't know for how long she was tied to that tree.

Identified as Lalita Kayi, the woman also had an Aadhaar card indicating an address in Tamil Nadu.\n\nHowever, her passport is no longer valid, leading authorities to verify these documents to confirm her nationality.\n\nThe chilling discovery was made by a shepherd from the Sonurli hamlet, who heard the woman's cries for help on Saturday night and quickly alerted the police. The circumstances surrounding her confinement and her current condition are being investigated by l ocal law enforcement.\n\nREAD MORE: Farming neighbours ordered to have no contact with each other as 'once good friends' leave 'legacy of hatred'\n\nREAD MORE: Irish holidaymakers injured in Portugal mass stabbing\n\nIn other news, bones discovered in Tokyo could be linked to Japan's horrifying human germ warfare experiments, while a US woman allegedly poisoned herself and five others in a Bangkok hotel due to overwhelming debt, according to police reports.\n\nAn official stated that the woman was initially taken to Oros in Sindhudurg before being transferred to a hospital in Sawantwadi, in the Konkan region of the state. Due to her mental and physical conditions, she was later moved to Goa Medical College for specialised treatment.\n\nThe officials have stated that the woman is not in immediate danger, but her treating physicians have identified mental health issues. During their investigation, it was revealed that she had prescription drugs in her possession.\n\nIn the meantime, the Foreigners Regional Registration office is working closely with the police on this matter. Initial information suggests that the woman has been living in India for the past ten years.\n\nSadly, due to her weakened condition, worsened by recent heavy rainfall in the area, she is currently unable to give a statement. It's also unclear how long she was tied to the tree, but suspicions are rising that her husband, who hails from Tamil Nadu, may have played a part in the incident.\n\nFollowing these developments, police teams have been sent to Tamil Nadu, Goa, and other places as part of the ongoing investigation to find her family. \"When we found her, she was severely dehydrated. It seems like she was stuck there for at least 48 hours. Even though she couldn't speak,\" said Amol Chavan, an inspector at Sawantwadi Police station and member of the team who found her.\n\nChavan added that she was \"responsive\". The police also found a purse and a laptop in her possession.\n\nChavan revealed that the police had to resort to cutting down the tree and breaking the lock as the woman's legs were chained to the tree. The case has now been transferred to Banda police station in Sindhudurg for further investigation, according to recent reports.\n\nA police official confirmed that the victim's Aadhaar card listed an address in Tamil Nadu. A note referencing her \"former husband\" was also found, leading to speculation that he may be located in Tamil Nadu.\n\n\"She is still very weak, so we haven't been able to record her statement yet,\" a police official informed local media.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

The FIR was registered after the woman claimed that her husband had taken her to the forest and chained her to the tree.\n\nWhile in hospital, the woman, who was unable to speak, wrote a note giving information about herself to the police. She claimed that her husband had shackled her to the tree and that she had been living without food and water in the forest for 40 days. 'Injection for extreme psychosis which caused severe locked jaw and inability to drink any water. Need intravenous food...40 days without food in the forest -- husband tied me to a tree in a forest and said I would die there,' said her note.\n\nBased on the revelations, the Banda police in Sindhudurg have registered an FIR under Sections 109 (attempt to murder) 125 (act endangering human life or personal safety of others) 127 (2) (wrongful confinement) and 127 (6) (wrongful confinement in secret) of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita. A police team has been trying to verify the woman's accusations.\n\n\"Different teams have been dispatched to various states to investigate the crime, and a separate team is undertaking the technical investigation,\" said a senior IPS officer.\n\nThe incident came to light on July 27 after a local from Sawantwadi taluka, who had taken his sheep and cows into a forested area, met with an alarming sight -- a woman chained to a tree with an iron shackle. The panicky man immediately informed the Banda police, which rushed to the spot to rescue her.\n\nThe woman was a United States citizen identified as Lalita Kai who claimed to be married to a man from Tamil Nadu and said she was living in India for around a decade. \"Her bag was with her, and it contained all her personal identification documents like a photocopy of her US passport and her Aadhar card,\" said a police official who is part of the investigating team. \"It also contained a raincoat and foodstuff.\"\n\nA police team has gone to Tamil Nadu to verify the address which is mentioned on the US citizen's Aadhar card as well as to verify her allegations against her husband.\n\nThe woman was given basic treatment in the Primary Health Centre, Sawantwadi and then admitted to the District Hospital, Sindhudurg. After that, she was shifted to a government hospital in Goa and then to the Institute of Psychiatry and Human Behaviour (IPHB) at Bambolim in Goa since she appeared to be suffering from a mental health condition, said Dr Shivanand Bandekar, the dean of Goa Medical College, who is also in charge of IPHB.\n\n\"A board is meeting on Tuesday to assess her mental health and check if there is any past history of mental illness,\" he said. \"On the medical side, she is stable as of now. She is not in a position to speak or give a statement and is only communicating through writing.\"\n\nThe spot where the woman was found is almost four km from the nearest villages, Ronapal and Sonurli, which fall in Sawantwadi taluka of Sindhudurg district. Locals often take their cows and cattle to the forest during the day.

She was later shifted to Goa for further treatment.\n\nPer the doctors treating the rescued woman, she has psychiatric issues and communicated by jotting down on a piece of paper. According to media reports, the woman claimed to have survived without food for 40 days in the jungle amidst rain. She alleged her ex-husband left her in the jungle to die. The cops informed that she was found with an expired visa and has been in India for 10 years. The woman was found by a shepherd in the forest of the Sonurli village of the coastal Sindhudurg district. The shepherd heard the woman's distress cry.

The panicky man immediately informed the Banda police, which rushed to the spot to rescue her.\n\nA police officer said that the woman was a 50-year-old United States citizen called Lalita Kai who claimed to be married to a man from Tamil Nadu and said she was living in India for around a decade. \"Her bag was with her and it contained all her personal identification documents like a photocopy of her US passport and her Aadhar card,\" said a police official who is part of the investigating team. \"It also contained a raincoat and foodstuff.\"\n\nThe Sindhudurg police have formed five teams to find out how the woman reached the forested area and who shackled her leg to a tree and abandoned her. While in hospital, the woman wrote a note giving information about herself to the police, and claimed that her husband had shackled her to the tree and that she had been living without food and water in the forest for 40 days. 'Injection for extreme psychosis which caused severe locked jaw and inability to drink any water. Need intravenous food...40 days without food in the forest -- husband tied me to a tree in a forest and said I would die there,' said her note.\n\nA police officer from Banda police station, however, said that this seemed impossible. \"A police team has gone to Tamil Nadu to verify the address which is mentioned on her Aadhar card as well as to verify what she told us about her husband,\" he said.\n\n\"There were no injury marks on her person. However, we could not record her statement, as she was not in a position to speak due to starvation and dehydration,\" said police inspector Hemchandra Khopade of the local crime branch.\n\nSanjay Darade, inspector-general of police for the Konkan range, said that after giving the woman basic medical treatment at the local hospital, taking into account her severely weakened state she was shifted to the Institute of Psychiatry and Human Behaviour (IPHB) at Bambolim in Goa.\n\nDean of the Goa Medical College who is also incharge of the IPHB said, \"On the medical side she is stable as of now. She is not in a position to speak or give a statement, she is only communicating through writing. The Maharashtra police are investigating the case.\"\n\nThe spot where the woman was found is almost four km from the nearest villages, Ronapal and Sonurli, which fall in Sawantwadi taluka of Sindhudurg district. The local people often take their cows and cattle to the forest during the day. The man who spotted the woman heard her faint cries from a distance. As soon as she espied him, she began screaming for help.\n\nThe Banda police have registered a diary entry and no case has been filed against anyone till now.

We haven't been able to record the woman's statement yet, as she is still very weak.\"\n\n(Edited by Tikli Basu)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "manasi_phadke@theprint.in", "name": "Manasi Phadke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Goa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThePrint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ThePrint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawantwadi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sawantwadi"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aadhaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindhudurg_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sindhudurg district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sindhudurg district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Tree_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Tree Climbing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Patches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Patches", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Mumbai-police-696x392-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771636", "eventUri": "eng-9771636", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

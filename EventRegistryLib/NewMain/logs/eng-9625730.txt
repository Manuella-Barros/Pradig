Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nSpaceX's Starship, the most powerful launch vehicle ever built, is set to lift off on its fourth flight test on Thursday. The highly anticipated event is the company's second uncrewed test of 2024.\n\nSpaceX is aiming to mark new milestones this time around, such as showcasing the reusability of the Starship vehicle.\n\nThe 120-minute launch window opens at 7 a.m. CT (8 a.m. ET), with launch expected at 7:50 a.m. CT (8:50 a.m. ET), and the company will stream live coverage on X, formerly known as Twitter, about 30 minutes prior to launch. Weather conditions are 95% favorable for the launch, according to SpaceX.\n\nThe Starship launch system, which includes the upper Starship spacecraft and a rocket booster known as the Super Heavy, will attempt to take flight from the private Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas.\n\nThe flight test comes two days after the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, gave SpaceX its approval. And the test is occurring one day after SpaceX's competitor under NASA's Commercial Crew Program, Boeing, successfully launched the first crewed mission of Starliner, which is carrying two veteran NASA astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nEach of Starship's test flights have different objectives that build on lessons learned and milestones achieved during the previous flight.\n\nSpaceX is now focusing on \"demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy. The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship,\" according to a company release.\n\nStarship is expected to splash down in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe Starship team made software and hardware upgrades to the launch system to incorporate lessons learned from the third flight.\n\n\"The fourth flight of Starship will aim to bring us closer to the rapidly reusable future on the horizon,\" according to SpaceX. \"We're continuing to rapidly develop Starship, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as quickly as possible as we build a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and beyond.\"\n\nThe first two attempts to get Starship to orbital speeds in 2023 ended in explosions, with the spacecraft and booster erupting into flames before reaching their intended landing sites.\n\nSpaceX is known to embrace fiery mishaps in the early stages of spacecraft development, saying these failures help the company rapidly implement design changes that lead to better results.\n\nSpaceX has said its approach to rocket development is geared toward speed. The company makes use of an engineering method called \"rapid spiral development.\" This process essentially boils down to a desire to build prototypes quickly and willingly blow them up to learn how to construct a better one -- faster than if the company solely relied on ground tests and simulations.\n\nAfter the explosive first and second Starship test flights, the company immediately sought to frame these mishaps as successes.\n\nThe nearly hour-long third test flight, conducted in March, achieved several milestones before breaking apart after reentry, rather than splashing down in the Indian Ocean.\n\nFirst, Starship reached speeds close to what would be required to put the vehicle in orbit. Typically, such a feat requires speeds topping 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kilometers per hour). Starship reached its orbital speeds goal and did not aim to enter orbit on the third flight.\n\nThe Starship's payload door -- a hatch that must open for the spacecraft to deploy satellites into space after reaching orbit -- swung open before resealing in a crucial test of that mechanism.\n\nSpaceX also carried out a \"propellant transfer demonstration,\" or moving some of the propellant on board the Starship vehicle from one tank to another. SpaceX engineers designed the demo to test how Starship will be refueled on future missions while it's in orbit.\n\nBut after a bright halo of red plasma, created by extreme heat and pressure as Starship reentered Earth's atmosphere, glowed around the vehicle, the team lost communication with the spacecraft.\n\nHowever, SpaceX never intended to recover Starship after this flight test.\n\nThe Super Heavy booster was also expected to make an autonomous, controlled landing in the ocean, but the booster was lost after all its engines failed to light.\n\nBut both the Starship spacecraft and booster made it farther into flight than the two previous tests in 2023.\n\nMuch is riding on Starship's eventual success. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly characterized the rocket as central to the company's founding mission: putting humans on Mars for the first time.\n\nNASA has selected the Starship spacecraft for a key role in its Artemis program to return humans to the moon for the first time in more than five decades. Under the federal space agency's current road map, Starship would complete the final leg of a crewed mission to the moon, taking the astronauts from a spacecraft in lunar orbit and ferrying them to the surface. The United States is in a race with China, vying to become first to develop a permanent lunar outpost and set the precedent for deep-space settlements.\n\nMilestones such as the propellant transfer from the third flight test objectives for the future. Topping off the spacecraft's fuel will be critical for Starship's high-profile missions down the road.\n\nWhen Starship makes a journey to the moon under Artemis -- it will have to sit in orbit close to Earth as SpaceX launches separate support vehicles that will transport fuel to the spacecraft.

NASA's Artemis program, for one, has selected Starship as the lander to carry Artemis 3 astronauts to the south pole of the moon in 2026.\n\nBut before Starship can fly to the moon, SpaceX has to prove the shiny, stainless steel rocket can reach orbit.\n\nThe company has flown three test flights to date: A failed debut in April 2023 that destroyed SpaceX's launch pad as well as the rocket; a second flight in November of that year that also failed to reach space; and the latest Starship Flight 3 launch on March 18 of this year, which reached space for the first time before the vehicle and its Super Heavy booster were lost prior to reaching their final splashdown targets.\n\nAfter each Starship launch test, the FAA conducted time-consuming failure investigations and made recommendations that SpaceX had to address before each subsequent launch attempt. For Starship Flight 4, SpaceX and the FAA have agreed on a different approach.\n\n\"As part of its request for license modification, SpaceX proposed three scenarios involving the Starship entry that would not require an investigation in the event of the loss of the vehicle. The FAA approved the scenarios as test induced damage exceptions after evaluating them as part of the flight safety and flight hazard analyses and confirming they met public safety requirements,\" FAA officials said in the statement. \"If a different anomaly occurs with the Starship vehicle an investigation may be warranted as well as if an anomaly occurs with the Super Heavy booster rocket.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n-- SpaceX launches giant Starship rocket into space on epic 3rd test flight (video)\n\n-- Starship and Super Heavy: SpaceX's Mars transportation system\n\n-- FAA to oversee investigation of SpaceX Starship's 3rd test flight\n\nThat agreement suggests SpaceX has identified three likely ways in which its Starship or Super Heavy could fail (such as loss during reentry) that the company and FAA agreed wouldn't need a lengthy investigation. The three scenarios did not appear to be detailed in the FAA's 6-page launch license.\n\nFor Flight 4, SpaceX aims to fly its Starship and Super Heavy booster on a similar trajectory as its Flight 3 test, a mission that would launch the Starship vehicle up to orbital velocity, then reenter the craft over the Indian Ocean. The Super Heavy booster, meanwhile, is expected to return toward South Texas and make a controlled \"landing\" in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,\" SpaceX wrote in a mission overview.\" The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, SpaceX has performed a series of fueling tests for both the Flight 4 Starship and its Super Heavy booster. Both vehicles apparently passed with flying colors.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Commercial_Space_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Office of Commercial Space Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alloy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artemis 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artemis program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_south_pole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lunar south pole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lander_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lander (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stainless steel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Xh8bkFdgqy4iNTK8fvDbvQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/space_311/8502dce6dc9fc2a8329cc3f1dae98444", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 122, "textEnd": 128}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 271, "textEnd": 277, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-18", "textStart": 1874, "textEnd": 1882}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Designed to be fully reusable, Starship is also meant to launch SpaceX's larger, upgraded Starlink satellites.\n\nFor this test flight, the company hopes to continue advancing Starship progress beyond its previous three tests. While the goal as usual is to send Starship to near orbital speeds in space, the company is now primarily focused on bringing the rocket back through Earth's atmosphere intact after the short trip is over. Such a capability will be key if SpaceX hopes to reuse the vehicle in the future.\n\nSpaceX doesn't plan to fully recover Starship on this flight, however. If the rocket survives the atmospheric plunge, it will splash down in the Indian Ocean.\n\nA successful completion of the maneuver would be an improvement from Starship's third test flight in March. During that launch, Starship reached near orbital speeds in space for the first time. But, during the return to Earth, the vehicle lost contact and disintegrated as it plunged through the atmosphere.\n\nSpaceX separately aims to have the Super Heavy booster -- the 33-engine lower portion that propels Starship toward orbit -- perform a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. During the previous flight, the booster failed to do a controlled landing and crashed hard into the ocean.\n\nSpaceX has been able to improve incrementally with each successive test launch of Starship. During the first two flights -- in April 2023 and in November -- the vehicle prematurely exploded before being able to perform the majority of the mission goals.\n\nFor SpaceX, these test flights are all part of Starship's development process, with the company not necessarily expecting fully successful launches but with hopes of pushing the envelope further with each new mission.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Testing_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Testing and Tools", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 14}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2081832!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/p-the-spacex-starship-rocket-ahead-of-its-fourth-flight-test-at-boca-chica-beach-texas-on-june-5-p.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Shortly after launch, the Super Heavy booster made an apparently successful \"soft landing\" in the Gulf of Mexico with a controlled splashdown. The Starship vehicle is in a 28-minute coast phase ahead of its own reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nSpaceX plans to launch its giant Starship rocket this morning (June 6), and you can watch the action live.\n\nStarship, the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built, is scheduled to launch from SpaceX's Starbase site in South Texas today, during a 100-minute window that opens at 8:50 a.m. EDT (1250 GMT; 7:50 a.m. local Texas time).\n\nUpdate for June 6, 7 am ET: SpaceX has a new launch time for today's Starship Flight 4. The launch is now targeted for 8:50 a.m. EDT (1250 GMT).\n\nToday's launch will kick off the fourth test flight for the 400-foot-tall (122-meter-tall) Starship, which consists of a first-stage booster called Super Heavy and an upper-stage spacecraft known as Starship, or simply \"Ship.\"\n\nThe first three Starship missions launched from Starbase in April 2023, November 2023 and March of this year; the debut flight ended just four minutes after liftoff because Starship's two stages failed to separate as planned, and SpaceX ordered a controlled detonation.\n\nStarship achieved stage separation on Flight 2, which lasted about eight minutes. Flight 3 saw an even bigger jump in performance; it ended about 50 minutes after launch with the breakup of Ship as it reentered Earth's atmosphere.\n\nShip was trying to come in for an Indian Ocean splashdown on Flight 3. That's the goal on Flight 4 as well. Super Heavy's target destination, meanwhile, will be the Gulf of Mexico, not far from Starbase.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n-- SpaceX launches giant Starship rocket into space on epic 3rd test flight (video)\n\n-- Starship and Super Heavy: SpaceX's Mars transportation system\n\n-- FAA to oversee investigation of SpaceX Starship's 3rd test flight\n\nSpaceX views the fully reusable Starship as a revolutionary advance in spaceflight and exploration.

Each of the test flights have achieved more milestones than the last, but each result destroyed the rocket before the flight's end.\n\nThe company's rocket flew the furthest in its third test flight, allowing SpaceX to test new capabilities including opening and closing the payload door once in space - which would be how the rocket deploys payloads such as a satellites on future missions - and transferring fuel during the flight in a NASA demonstration.\n\nSign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter.\n\nThe Starship system is designed to be fully reusable and aims to become a new method of flying cargo and people beyond Earth. The rocket is also critical to NASA's plan to return astronauts to the moon. SpaceX won a multibillion-dollar contract from the agency to use Starship as a crewed lunar lander as part of NASA's Artemis moon program.\n\nSpaceX heavily emphasizes an approach of building \"on what we've learned from previous flights\" in its approach to develop Starship. The company says its strategy focuses on \"recursive improvement\" to the rocket, where even test flights with fiery outcomes represent progress toward its goal of a fully reusable rocket that can deliver people to the moon and Mars.\n\nMusk last year said he expected the company to spend about $2 billion on Starship development in 2023.\n\nThere are no people on board this Starship spaceflight. The company's leadership has previously emphasized that SpaceX expects to fly hundreds of Starship missions before the rocket launches with any crew.\n\nSpaceX will be looking to surpass the third test flight's milestones. The company wrote in an update on its website that the fourth flight \"turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy.\"\n\n\"The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship,\" SpaceX wrote.\n\nThe company says it's completed a number of software and hardware changes to Starship, aimed at increasing the rocket's reliability.\n\nStarship is both the tallest and most powerful rocket ever launched. Fully stacked on the Super Heavy booster, Starship stands 397 feet tall and is about 30 feet in diameter.\n\nThe Super Heavy booster, which stands 232 feet tall, is what begins the rocket's journey to space. At its base are 33 Raptor engines, which together produce 16.7 million pounds of thrust - about double the 8.8 million pounds of thrust of NASA's Space Launch System rocket, which launched for the first time in 2022.\n\nStarship itself, at 165 feet tall, has six Raptor engines - three for use while in the Earth's atmosphere and three for operating in the vacuum of space.\n\nThe rocket is powered by liquid oxygen and liquid methane. The full system requires more than 10 million pounds of propellant for launch.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_lander", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lunar lander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Payload"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Launch System"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2024/03/107387627-17104340252024-03-14t155746z_988141539_rc2pl6antaw5_rtrmadp_0_space-exploration-starship.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

It is the latest trial mission in the test-to-failure rocket development campaign of Elon Musk's company.\n\nThe rocket system's first stage, called Super Heavy, detached from the Starship upper stage three minutes into flight dozens of miles above ground, sending the Starship on its way toward space.\n\nSuper Heavy headed back toward land and appeared to achieve a soft landing in the Gulf of Mexico. Starship, meanwhile, blasted its own engines to begin its trek around the globe toward the Indian Ocean, a roughly 70-minute trip.\n\nThere, it began its free-fall back to Earth where it endured the intense heat of atmospheric reentry - the crucial point at which it failed in March.\n\nDesigned to be cheaper and more powerful than SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, Starship - standing nearly 400 feet (122 meters) tall - represents the future of the company's dominant satellite launch and astronaut business. It is due to be used by NASA in the next few years to land the first astronauts on the moon since 1972.\n\nEach Starship rocket has made it farther in its testing objectives than previous tests before failing, either by blowing up or disintegrating in the atmosphere.\n\nThe rocket's first launch in April 2023 exploded minutes after liftoff some 25 miles (40 km) above ground. During the next attempt in November, Starship reached space for the first time but exploded soon after.\n\nIn its most recent flight in March, Starship made it much farther and broke apart in Earth's atmosphere as it attempted to return from space halfway around the globe.\n\nThe rocket's flight on Thursday was a repeat of its previous test but with the aim to get farther.\n\nThe rocket is covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds. \"The main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during reentry, ideally through max heating,\" Musk, CEO of SpaceX, wrote on social media on Saturday.\n\nMuch is riding on SpaceX's development of Starship, relied upon by NASA as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026 in a rivalry with China, which plans to send its astronauts there by 2030. China has made several recent advances in its lunar program, including a second landing on the moon's far side in a sample retrieval mission.\n\nDespite Starship's development appearing quicker than other rocket programs, it has been slower than Musk originally envisioned. A Japanese billionaire who initially paid to fly Starship around the moon canceled his flight last week, citing schedule uncertainties.\n\nAnd Musk's drive to rapidly build Starship has endangered SpaceX workers in Texas and California, a Reuters investigation found.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Weather conditions look favourable, and the Federal Aviation Administration has given its green light.\n\nThree previous attempts have ended in Starship's fiery destruction, all part of what the company says is an acceptable cost in its rapid trial-and-error approach to development.\n\n'The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,' SpaceX said in a statement.\n\nSuper Heavy is the booster, while Starship refers to both the upper stage and the two stages combined.\n\nThe flight path will be similar to the third test, which took place in March and saw Starship fly halfway around the globe before it was eventually lost as it re-entered the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean, 49 minutes into the mission.\n\nSince then SpaceX says it has made several software and hardware upgrades and hopes to achieve a soft splashdown for the booster stage in the Gulf of Mexico, and a 'controlled entry' for the upper stage.\n\nDesigned to eventually be fully reusable, Starship stands 397 feet tall with both stages combined -- 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty.\n\nIts Super Heavy booster produces 16.7 million pounds of thrust, almost double that of the world's second most powerful rocket, NASA's Space Launch System -- though the latter is now certified, while Starship is still under development.\n\nSpaceX's strategy of carrying out tests in the real world rather than in labs has paid off in the past.\n\nIts Falcon 9 rockets have come to be workhorses for NASA and the commercial sector, its Dragon capsule sends astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, and its Starlink internet satellite constellation now covers dozens of countries.\n\nBut the clock is ticking for SpaceX to be ready for NASA's planned return of astronauts to the Moon in 2026, using a modified Starship as the lander vehicle.\n\nTo accomplish this, SpaceX will need to first place a Starship in orbit, then refuel it with multiple Starship tankers for its onward journey -- a complex engineering feat that has never before been accomplished.\n\nAt least one SpaceX fan has grown tired of waiting.

It can be viewed, starting at 7:30 a.m. EDT on Thursday, on a free live webcast offered by SpaceX, which is targeting a launch time of 8 a.m. EDT.\n\nTo date, SpaceX has flown three test flights, with its most recent launch on March 14. While the Starship rocket flew farther and faster than the previous two tests, the company confirmed it had \"lost\" the ship as it was re-entering the Earth's atmosphere despite reaching orbital velocity. The rocket failed to complete splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nLast year, SpaceX conducted two Starship rocket test flights, with each test ending in failure and the destruction of the rocket.\n\nThe first test of 2023 launched April 20, and ended with the rocket's two stages failing to separate. SpaceX blamed leaking fuel and other malfunctions as the 33 Raptor engines powering the Super Heavy booster failed to ignite. The rocket system was intentionally destroyed as the launch also caused significant damage to the Texas launch pad and nearby Boca Chica State Park.\n\nThe FAA grounded the Starship and ordered SpaceX to conduct 63 corrective actions that included redesigning hardware to prevent leaks and fires, fortifying the launch pad, testing safety systems and applying other charge-control practices.\n\nLast year's second test flight launched Nov. 18 from Texas. While the 33 Raptor rocket engines on the Super Heavy booster ignited and completed a full-duration burn with a successful hot-stage separation, the Super Heavy booster experienced a \"rapid unscheduled disassembly\" following a flip maneuver about 3.5 minutes into the flight. Once SpaceX lost communications with the rocket, it automatically destructed.\n\nThursday's fourth Starship test flight comes after the FAA conducted exhaustive failure investigations of the three previous launches and made recommendations to fix the problems.\n\n\"As part of its request for license modification, SpaceX proposed three scenarios involving Starship entry that would not require an investigation in the event of the loss of the vehicle. The FAA approved the scenarios as test-induced damage exceptions after evaluating them as part of the flight safety and flight hazard analyses and confirming they met public safety requirements,\" the FAA said in a statement.\n\n\"If a different anomaly occurs with the Starship vehicle, an investigation may be warranted as well as if an anomaly occurs with the Super Heavy booster rocket,\" the FAA added.\n\nFor Thursday's fourth test flight, SpaceX plans to send Starship and the Super Heavy booster on a similar path as its Flight 3 test, with Starship reaching orbital velocity and re-entering over the Indian Ocean as the Super Heavy booster makes a controlled landing in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"The fourth flight test turns our focus to achieving orbit and to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,\" according to SpaceX. \"The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship.\"\n\nThe company said it hopes Flight 4 will build on the progress and lessons learned from the previous three test flights.\n\n\"We're continuing to rapidly develop Starship, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as quickly as possible as we build a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, Mars and beyond,\" SpaceX said.\n\nEarlier this week, SpaceX founder Elon Musk declared in a post on X, \"Starship is ready to fly.\"", "source": {"uri": "spacedaily.com", "dataType":

The main objective for today's test flight is to recover both the Starship rocket and its Super Heavy booster to prove its reusability.\n\nSpaceX received all the necessary regulatory approval for the launch, and restrictions are already in place for road and marine traffic.\n\nA 120-minute launch window opened at 7am local time (1pm BST), with lift-off taking place at 7.50am CT. You can watch a live stream of the Starship launch below.\n\nYou can watch the Starship launch live stream right here:\n\nStarship is somehow still holding together, though it's hard to tell from the live stream what is actually happening.\n\nThere should be a flip manoeuvre right about now but the camera is so broken that it's impossible to tell. The team at SpaceX is cheering as it passes through 10km altitude.\n\n\"It's probably hanging on by a couple of bolts and threads,\" one of SpaceX's live stream commentator says.\n\nDebris is flying off Starship now, and even the camera lens has cracked. Remarkably, the craft has made it to an altitude of 45km and we still have live views.\n\n\"We can't really tell how much of the ship is left,\" SpaceX says.\n\nWe're at 52km altitude and one of the flaps appears to be on fire.\n\nSpaceX reminds us that the data is the payload on today's test flight.\n\nIf Starship survives reentry - which it didn't last time - then it will need to perform a flip manoeuvre before splashing down in the Indian Ocean.\n\nPlasma is really building up now as it approaches \"peak-heating\".\n\nStarship is now making its way back to Earth, with its altitude dropping back below 100 kilometres.\n\nTravelling at more than five times the speed of sound, the plasma around the ship is beginning to build as it approaches the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nWhile we wait for the live stream to return, here's the moment Starship separated from its Super Heavy booster:\n\nWatch the moment the Super Heavy booster returned to Earth\n\n14:15 , Anthony Cuthbertson\n\nHere's the moment Starship's Super Heavy booster successfully splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico, before toppling over.\n\nThere's going to be a 20 minute break on the live stream while Starship coasts across the Atlantic and Indian Ocean.\n\nThere's currently no signal in these parts of planetary orbit, but SpaceX hopes to equip future versions of the rocket with its Starlink satellite internet that will provide non-stop coverage.\n\nWhen the stream starts up again we can expect an attempt at a flip manouvre, reentry and hopefully a soft splash down in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn the mean time we're treated to Johann Strauss's The Blue Danube, a waltz that was used by Stabley Kubrick in his epic 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nInterest doesn't appear to be dropping off, with 2 million people now tuned into the live stream.\n\nWe've just had the first ever successful splashdown of the Super Heavy booster. The typically enthusiastic SpaceX team are suitably excited by the giant rocket firing up its landing burn and reaching the water without exploding.\n\nAnother major milestone is passed, as Starship separates from its Super Heavy booster.\n\nThe booster will now return to Earth for a water landing in the Gulf of Mexico, while the main Starship rocket will continue now for another 40 minutes before attempting its own return to Earth.\n\nStarship has passed Max Q, which is the moment the maximum stress is put on the rocket.\n\nOne of the Raptor rockets on the Super Heavy booster appears to not be working, but this should not be critical. The next big test is hot stage separation, which is where the whole system exploded in an earlier test.\n\nThe official live stream for this Starship launch has just passed 1 million viewers, showing just how popular this rocket is.\n\nAll the propellant is loaded now, meaning we're into the final stages of the countdown. There may be a hold at 40 seconds, where it can stay for up to 30 minutes.\n\nSpaceX announces plans for Starship launch towers\n\n13:45 , Anthony Cuthbertson\n\nSpaceX has said that it is planning to build another launch tower at its Starbase facility in Texas, as well as two additional launch towers in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nIt also wants to ramp up its production targets to eventually build one Starship per day. SpaceX boss wants a fleet of thousands to establish a self-sustaining human colony on Mars.\n\nSpaceX has shared an animation showing the route its Starship rocket should take if all goes well today. After lifting off from the Starbase facility in Texas, the Super Heavy Booster will drop away into the Gulf of Mexico before the main rocket continues on over the Atlantic Ocean, across the southern part of Africa dn then down into the Indian Ocean just before reaching Australia.\n\nUsually in the build-up to these Starship flight tests, Elon Musk gives his odds for how likely it is to succeed. I haven't seen any such forecasts this time (comment if you've seen anything), but SpaceX has one prediction for today. In its official countdown for the lift-off, SpaceX notes at 00:00:00: \"Excitement guaranteed.\"\n\nMore than half a million people are already tuned into the Starship launch live stream, which is way more than the last launch at this stage. That may be because it's streaming exclusively on X, so all viewers are concentrated in one place.\n\nWith no crew or cargo onboard today, SpaceX says \"the payload for this mission is data\".\n\nLiquid oxygen and liquid methane propellent are still being loaded to the Starship rocket and its Super Heavy booster, with just over 20 minutes to go until launch.\n\nThere are currently no vehicle or weather issues, but SpaceX says a backup launch window will most likely be in 48 hours, just in case.\n\n\"Building upon what we achieved during Starship's third flight test, our primary goal today is to get through the extreme heat of reentry,\" SpaceX said.\n\n\"We're continuing to rapidly develop Starship, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as quickly as possible as we build a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and beyond.\"\n\nSpaceX says propellant load for Starship is now underway.\n\nThis should take another 15 minutes or so. Once this stage is complete, it is up to the SpaceX flight director to verify whether or not the rocket is go for launch.\n\nIf successful, today will be the 60th orbital launch of 2024 for SpaceX - one short of the total number of orbital rocket launches the company achieved in 2022.\n\nWith more than half of 2024 still to go, SpaceX is well on track to hit three figures for the first time in its 22 year history.\n\nIf today's launch is scrubbed, SpaceX has backup launch windows for the Starship flight attempt in place.\n\nBeach closure advisories to the public have been issued for 7 June and 8 June by officials at Cameron County where SpaceX's Starbase facility is located. They list times of 12am local time to 2pm on both days.\n\nSpaceX says the launch is now scheduled for 7.50am local time (1.50pm BST), which is 50 minutes into the two hour launch window. That still gives plenty of time for any minor delays that might arise during the countdown, as they have done in the past.\n\nWeather conditions for the launch are reportedly 95 per cent favourable, which is about as high as it gets for a launch like this.\n\nWe'll have a live stream in about 50 minutes.\n\nSpaceX hoping to build on 'phenomenal' Starship progress\n\n12:13 , Anthony Cuthbertson\n\nSpaceX described the last Starship flight test in March as \"phenomenal\", despite both parts of the rocket being ultimately lost. It is a view that appears to be shared by those financing the endeavour, acoording to those we spoke to following the launch.\n\nChad Anderson, a managing partner at SpaceX investor Space Capital, told The Independent that he believed it was a \"hugely successful\" mission and an \"incredible breakthrough\" for the company.\n\n\"The engineering challenges are immense for a vehicle of this size and complexity,\" he said. \"Starship is a revolutionary launch vehicle that promises to shake up all the givens of space: that it's expensive, difficult, and dangerous to get there.\"\n\nYou can read more about Starship Test Flight 3 here:\n\nElon Musk's Starship rocket made it to space - is the mission to Mars really on?\n\nSpaceX has helpfully given a full rundown of what to expect from today's launch, revealing what each stage of the lift-off, flight and landing should look like - to the nearest second.\n\nThere's also an illustration to give a vague idea of what it all should look like:\n\nOn 14 March, which coincidentally is SpaceX's birthday, Starship lifted off from the Starbase facility and travelled for nearly an hour through space before eventually breaking up upon reentry to the Earth's atmosphere above the Indian Ocean.\n\nToday's flight should take a similar trajectory, with the estimated time projected to be one hour and five minutes.\n\nYou can watch the launch, flight, and eventual demise of the last Starship spacecraft to attempt it here (skip to around 38 minutes for the lift off):\n\nThe two-hour launch window will open in just a couple of hours, with Starship fully stacked and waiting to be fuelled on the launchpad at SpaceX's Starbase facility.\n\nHere's what the company has said it hopes to achieve with today's launch:\n\nMeasuring 120 metres tall, Starship is the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built - but SpaceX boss Elon Musk says it will soon be even bigger.\n\nResponding to a post to X (formerly Twitter) last month, Mr Musk wrote that Starship \"will probably approach ~140m (currently ~120m) over time\".\n\nFor comparison, the Great Pyramid of Giza - the largest Egyptian pyramid - stands at 137m. It is not clear whether this additional height will result in more power, with the current version capable of producing 7.5 million kilograms of thrust - roughly double that of the world's second most powerful rocket, Nasa's Space Launch System (SLS).\n\nToday's attempt comes just three months after SpaceX last sent a Starship rocket into space, and while it successfully reached orbit, not all went to plan.\n\nBoth the Super Heavy booster and the main Starship rocket were destroyed before they could make it back to Earth, making today's attempt a critical test of SpaceX's hopes of using the spacecraft for missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond in the coming years. Proving that both parts of its massive rocket are reusable is the main aim for SpaceX today, so we will hope to see them splash down in the Gulf of Mexico and Indian Ocean respectively. And no more explosions.\n\nWe've got a round-up of SpaceX's explosive Starship history. You can watch it here:\n\nto The Independent's live coverage of today's Starship launch attempt. The rocket is stacked, the roads are cleared, and approval has been granted by the necessary authorities for lift off to go ahead.\n\nWe'll be bringing you all the latest updates, analysis and even a live stream of the launch itself as soon as it's ready.", "source": {"uri": "au.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!7 News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It is the latest trial mission in the test-to-failure rocket development campaign of Elon Musk's company.\n\nThe rocket system's first stage, called Super Heavy, detached from the Starship upper stage three minutes into flight dozens of miles above ground, sending the Starship on its way toward space.\n\nSuper Heavy headed back toward land and appeared to achieve a soft landing in the Gulf of Mexico. Starship, meanwhile, blasted its own engines to begin its trek around the globe toward the Indian Ocean, a roughly 70-minute trip.\n\nThere, it began its free fall back to Earth, where it endured the intense heat of atmospheric reentry -- the crucial point at which it failed in March.\n\nDesigned to be cheaper and more powerful than SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, Starship -- standing nearly 400 feet (122 meters) tall -- represents the future of the company's dominant satellite launch and astronaut business. It is due to be used by NASA in the next few years to land the first astronauts on the moon since 1972.\n\nEach Starship rocket has made it farther in its testing objectives than previous tests before failing, either by blowing up or disintegrating in the atmosphere.\n\nThe rocket's first launch, in April 2023, exploded minutes after liftoff some 25 miles (40 km) above ground. During the next attempt, in November, Starship reached space for the first time but exploded soon after.\n\nIn its most recent flight, in March, Starship made it much farther and broke apart in Earth's atmosphere as it attempted to return from space halfway around the globe.\n\nThe rocket's flight on Thursday was a repeat of its previous test but with the aim to get farther.\n\nThe rocket is covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.\n\n\"The main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during reentry, ideally through max heating,\" Musk, CEO of SpaceX, wrote on social media on Saturday.\n\nMuch is riding on SpaceX's development of Starship, relied upon by NASA as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026 in a rivalry with China, which plans to send its astronauts there by 2030. China has made several recent advances in its lunar program, including a second landing on the moon's far side in a sample retrieval mission.\n\nDespite Starship's development appearing quicker than other rocket programs, it has been slower than Musk originally envisioned.

It can be viewed, starting at 7:30 a.m. EDT on Thursday, on a free live webcast offered by SpaceX, which is targeting a launch time of 8 a.m. EDT.\n\nTo date, SpaceX has flown three test flights, with its most recent launch on March 14. While the Starship rocket flew farther and faster than the previous two tests, the company confirmed it had \"lost\" the ship as it was re-entering the Earth's atmosphere despite reaching orbital velocity. The rocket failed to complete splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nLast year, SpaceX conducted two Starship rocket test flights, with each test ending in failure and the destruction of the rocket.\n\nThe first test of 2023 launched April 20, and ended with the rocket's two stages failing to separate. SpaceX blamed leaking fuel and other malfunctions as the 33 Raptor engines powering the Super Heavy booster failed to ignite. The rocket system was intentionally destroyed as the launch also caused significant damage to the Texas launch pad and nearby Boca Chica State Park.\n\nThe FAA grounded the Starship and ordered SpaceX to conduct 63 corrective actions that included redesigning hardware to prevent leaks and fires, fortifying the launch pad, testing safety systems and applying other charge-control practices.\n\nLast year's second test flight launched Nov. 18 from Texas. While the 33 Raptor rocket engines on the Super Heavy booster ignited and completed a full-duration burn with a successful hot-stage separation, the Super Heavy booster experienced a \"rapid unscheduled disassembly\" following a flip maneuver about 3.5 minutes into the flight. Once SpaceX lost communications with the rocket, it automatically destructed.\n\nThursday's fourth Starship test flight comes after the FAA conducted exhaustive failure investigations of the three previous launches and made recommendations to fix the problems.\n\n\"As part of its request for license modification, SpaceX proposed three scenarios involving Starship entry that would not require an investigation in the event of the loss of the vehicle. The FAA approved the scenarios as test-induced damage exceptions after evaluating them as part of the flight safety and flight hazard analyses and confirming they met public safety requirements,\" the FAA said in a statement.\n\n\"If a different anomaly occurs with the Starship vehicle, an investigation may be warranted as well as if an anomaly occurs with the Super Heavy booster rocket,\" the FAA added.\n\nFor Thursday's fourth test flight, SpaceX plans to send Starship and the Super Heavy booster on a similar path as its Flight 3 test, with Starship reaching orbital velocity and re-entering over the Indian Ocean as the Super Heavy booster makes a controlled landing in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"The fourth flight test turns our focus to achieving orbit and to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,\" according to SpaceX. \"The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship.\"\n\nThe company said it hopes Flight 4 will build on the progress and lessons learned from the previous three test flights.\n\n\"We're continuing to rapidly develop Starship, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as quickly as possible as we build a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, Mars and beyond,\" SpaceX said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship",

(Image credit: CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSpaceX launched its massive Starship vehicle on a fourth flight test today (June 6), once again leading to some breathtaking photography.\n\nStarship consists of a first-stage booster rocket known as Super Heavy and the upper-stage spacecraft known as Starship (sometimes referred to as \"Ship\"). Together, the pair makes up the largest and most powerful rocket ever built by humans.\n\nOn this fourth flight test, Starship took off once more from SpaceX's Starbase facility along the shores of south Texas at at 8:50 a.m. EDT (1250 GMT) on Thursday (June 6). The vehicle made it through booster separation before Super Heavy made a successful soft \"landing,\" splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico. After a fiery reentry, Starship made a successful landing burn before making its own splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nAs with previous Starship flight tests, scores of cameras were pointed at SpaceX's megarocket to capture the spectacle. SpaceX posted a picture of Starship just before liftoff, with the early morning sun rising above the massive rocket.\n\nThe sheer power of Super Heavy's 33 Raptor engines can be seen in SpaceX's drone shot below.\n\nWhile clouds and haze blocked many cameras, SpaceX was able to capture the following shot of Starship rocketing past the early morning sun.\n\nThe scale of the 400-foot-tall (122-meter-tall) Starship vehicle can be seen in this photo from SpaceX.\n\nPhotographer Chandan Khanna caught this fiery image of Super Heavy's Raptor engines igniting at liftoff.\n\nDespite the haze, Starship made for an impressive sight when it cleared the launch pad.\n\nAstrophotographer Andrew McCarthy caught a breathtaking shot of Starship as it made its way toward space, capturing 32 of the vehicle's 33 Raptor engines firing during liftoff. \"A glorious ascent. Starship doesn't disappoint,\" McCarthy posted on X alongside the photo.\n\nOne of the milestones SpaceX achieved on this fourth flight test was a successful splashdown of Starship's Super Heavy booster. In the future, the company plans to catch the rocket using massive \"chopstick\" arms on the vehicle's launch tower.\n\nSpaceX provided live views of Starship's reentry through Earth's atmosphere during the flight test as the vehicle was sheathed in plasma.\n\nStarship's reentry was a nail-biter, as pieces of the vehicle could be seen burning away as the spacecraft made its way through Earth's atmosphere. Despite the visible damage Starship suffered, it was able to perform a landing burn above the Indian Ocean northwest of Australia.\n\nWhile neither Super Heavy nor Starship were recovered during this test flight, SpaceX commentators during the launch coverage stressed that the \"data was the payload\" for this mission, meaning the data the company receives from the flight will help in the further development of the Starship vehicle as the company aims further test flights this year.\n\nNow that Starship has (mostly) survived reentry, SpaceX will work towards catching the Super Heavy booster with the massive chopstick arms on its launch tower following reentry on the next test launch. \"I think we should try to catch the booster with the mechazilla arms next flight!, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk posted on X following the test flight.", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brett_tingley@space.com", "name": "Brett Tingley", "type":

Working toward an ultimate goal of delivering astronauts back and forth between the Earth, moon and even Mars, SpaceX has called each previous test flight an improvement on the last.\n\nSpaceX provided live coverage of the launch on the SpaceX website and X, formerly Twitter, account. The company has been provided millions in funding from NASA in hopes of producing a commercial rocket that can safely take astronauts to the moon by 2026.\n\nSpaceX launch livestream: How to watch Starship's fourth test flight\n\nHere are updates from the launch and what to know about the previous test flights.\n\nStarship test launches: Here's what happened in first 3 SpaceX Starship test launches\n\nSpaceX Starship takes off\n\nThe SpaceX Starship spacecraft lifted off from SpaceX's private Starbase site in Boca Chica, Texas at 8:50 a.m. E.T. on Thursday.\n\nThis time, 32 of 33 engines lit as the craft launched. Roughly three minutes into the flight, the ship successfully began traveling on its own without the assistance of the booster.\n\nAround 7 minutes and 30 seconds into the flight, the booster successfully re-entered Earth's atmosphere and splash down into the Indian Ocean.\n\nThis is the fourth such unmanned test launch of the Starship, which hopes to one day bring NASA astronauts to the moon and even as far as Mars.\n\n\"We're continuing to rapidly develop Starship, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as quickly as possible as we build a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and beyond,\" said the space company in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nWhat is the goal of the Starship test launch?\n\nThe successful launch is a positive sign for SpaceX and NASA, which awarded the company a $2.9 billion contract in 2021 to develop the first commercial human lander for its upcoming Artemis III mission to the moon slated for 2026.\n\nNASA agreed to pay Elon Musk's company the hefty sum in hopes SpaceX will develop a spacecraft able to transport astronauts to the moon's surface.\n\nNASA originally intended to launch this mission and its Artemis II astronauts into orbit by the end of the year on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon. The space agency then planned a moon landing for one year later, part of the Artemis III mission. However, the program missions have since been delayed by at least a year after NASA encountered a slew of issues.\n\nNASA intends to eventually send a crew to the moon's unexplored south-polar region in a mission that would be the first of its kind in American history since the Apollo program ended in 1972.\n\nWhat happened during previous Starship test launches?\n\nSpaceX's Starship has had three previous test launches since April 2023. While all three ended in explosions, each one \"made tremendous strides\" toward the ultimate goal of developing rapidly reliable reusable rockets.\n\nStarship got off to a rough start when it exploded just four minutes into its inaugural test flight on April 20, 2023.\n\nThe craft launched from the Starbase site, but several of the craft's engines failed to ignite, triggering an explosion before the booster and spacecraft were able to separate. The rocket's flight termination system was activated to destroy the tumbling vehicle, which reached a total height of about 24 miles above the ground.\n\nThe second launch attempt on Nov. 18 2023 saw the craft survive longer and reach new milestones.\n\nThis time, the booster was able to successfully separate from the rocket, which reached space before the ground crew lost communication with it after nine minutes. Three minutes later, SpaceX lost both the booster and the spacecraft in two explosions.\n\nAll 33 booster engines fired as designed in this launch, and the ship reached an altitude of 92 miles.\n\nThe third test launch, which took place on March 14, saw Starship successfully separating from the booster and making it to orbit shortly after launch.\n\nA series of in-flight tests were conducted until Starship began to make its way back into the Earth's atmosphere, at which point signal to the craft was lost and about an hour into the mission and it was concluded the craft likely broke apart.\n\nSpaceX said this flight reached several more milestones, including the first reentry from space, first opening and closing of the craft/s payload door in space and a successful propellant transfer demonstration.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type":

the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship.\"\n\nBuilding off of the third flight's shortcomings, the company made upgrades to both software and hardware as well as changes to launch operations to up the ship's reliability, the company stated.\n\nThe flight path will be similar to launch No. 3 aiming for the upper stage to splash down in the Indian Ocean, without the need for a deorbit burn, \"maximizing public safety while still providing the opportunity to meet our primary objective of a controlled Starship reentry.\"\n\n\"The fourth flight of Starship will aim to bring us closer to the rapidly reusable future on the horizon,\" the company stated. \"We're continuing to rapidly develop Starship, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as

Working toward an ultimate goal of delivering astronauts back and forth between the Earth, moon and even Mars, SpaceX has called each previous test flight an improvement on the last.\n\nSpaceX provided live coverage of the launch on the SpaceX website and X, formerly Twitter, account. The company has been provided millions in funding from NASA in hopes of producing a commercial rocket that can safely take astronauts to the moon by 2026.\n\nSpaceX launch livestream: How to watch Starship's fourth test flight\n\nHere are updates from the launch and what to know about the previous test flights.\n\nStarship test launches: Here's what happened in first 3 SpaceX Starship test launches\n\nSpaceX Starship takes off\n\nThe SpaceX Starship spacecraft lifted off from SpaceX's private Starbase site in Boca Chica, Texas at 8:50 a.m. E.T. on Thursday for what appears to be its most successful run yet.\n\nThis time, 32 of 33 booster engines lit as the craft launched. Roughly three minutes into the flight, the ship successfully began traveling on its own without the assistance of the booster.\n\nAround 7 minutes and 20 seconds into the flight, the craft's booster successfully separated and splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico. All six of Starship's engines powered it into successful orbital insertion.\n\nThis is the fourth such unmanned test launch of the Starship, which hopes to one day bring NASA astronauts to the moon and even as far as Mars.\n\n\"We're continuing to rapidly develop Starship, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as quickly as possible as we build a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and beyond,\" said the space company in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nWhat is the goal of the Starship test launch?\n\nThe successful launch is a positive sign for SpaceX and NASA, which awarded the company a $2.9 billion contract in 2021 to develop the first commercial human lander for its upcoming Artemis III mission to the moon slated for 2026.\n\nNASA agreed to pay Elon Musk's company the hefty sum in hopes SpaceX will develop a spacecraft able to transport astronauts to the moon's surface.\n\nNASA originally intended to launch this mission and its Artemis II astronauts into orbit by the end of the year on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon. The space agency then planned a moon landing for one year later, part of the Artemis III mission. However, the program missions have since been delayed by at least a year after NASA encountered a slew of issues.\n\nNASA intends to eventually send a crew to the moon's unexplored south-polar region in a mission that would be the first of its kind in American history since the Apollo program ended in 1972.\n\nWhat happened during previous Starship test launches?\n\nSpaceX's Starship has had three previous test launches since April 2023. While all three ended in explosions, each one \"made tremendous strides\" toward the ultimate goal of developing rapidly reliable reusable rockets.\n\nStarship got off to a rough start when it exploded just four minutes into its inaugural test flight on April 20, 2023.\n\nThe craft launched from the Starbase site, but several of the craft's engines failed to ignite, triggering an explosion before the booster and spacecraft were able to separate. The rocket's flight termination system was activated to destroy the tumbling vehicle, which reached a total height of about 24 miles above the ground.\n\nThe second launch attempt on Nov. 18 2023 saw the craft survive longer and reach new milestones.\n\nThis time, the booster was able to successfully separate from the rocket, which reached space before the ground crew lost communication with it after nine minutes. Three minutes later, SpaceX lost both the booster and the spacecraft in two explosions.\n\nAll 33 booster engines fired as designed in this launch, and the ship reached an altitude of 92 miles.\n\nThe third test launch, which took place on March 14, saw Starship successfully separating from the booster and making it to orbit shortly after launch.\n\nA series of in-flight tests were conducted until Starship began to make its way back into the Earth's atmosphere, at which point signal to the craft was lost and about an hour into the mission and it was concluded the craft likely broke apart.\n\nSpaceX said this flight reached several more milestones, including the first reentry from space, first opening and closing of the craft/s payload door in space and a successful propellant

It is the latest trial mission in the test-to-failure rocket development campaign of Elon Musk's company.\n\nThe rocket system's first stage, called Super Heavy, detached from the Starship upper stage three minutes into flight dozens of kilometres above ground, sending the Starship on its way toward space.\n\nSuper Heavy headed back toward land and appeared to achieve a soft landing in the Gulf of Mexico. Starship, meanwhile, blasted its own engines to begin its trek around the globe toward the Indian Ocean, a roughly 70-minute trip.\n\nThere, it began its free-fall back to Earth where it endured the intense heat of atmospheric reentry - the crucial point at which it failed in March.\n\nDesigned to be cheaper and more powerful than SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, Starship - standing nearly 122 metres tall - represents the future of the company's dominant satellite launch and astronaut business. It is due to be used by Nasa in the next few years to land the first astronauts on the moon since 1972.\n\nEach Starship rocket has made it farther in its testing objectives than previous tests before failing, either by blowing up or disintegrating in the atmosphere.\n\nThe rocket's first launch in April 2023 exploded minutes after liftoff some 40 kilometres above ground. During the next attempt in November, Starship reached space for the first time but exploded soon after.\n\nIn its most recent flight in March, Starship made it much farther and broke apart in Earth's atmosphere as it attempted to return from space halfway around the globe.\n\nThe rocket's flight on Thursday was a repeat of its previous test but with the aim to get farther.\n\nThe rocket is covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.\n\n\"The main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during reentry, ideally through max heating,\" Musk, CEO of SpaceX, wrote on social media on Saturday.\n\nMuch is riding on SpaceX's development of Starship, relied upon by Nasa as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026.\n\nDespite Starship's development appearing quicker than other rocket programmes, it has been slower than Musk originally envisioned. A Japanese billionaire who initially paid to fly Starship around the moon cancelled his flight last week, citing schedule uncertainties.

Choose the best entertainer in 15 categories for FREE.\n\nStarship, SpaceX's massive prototype rocket that may one day send humans to Mars, is poised for its next flight on Thursday.\n\nIt will be the fourth test for the most powerful launch system ever built, vital to NASA's plans for landing astronauts on the Moon later this decade and to SpaceX CEO's Elon Musk's hopes of one day colonizing the Red Planet.\n\nA two-hour liftoff window from the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas opens at 7:00 am local time (1200 GMT). Weather conditions look favorable, and the Federal Aviation Administration has given its green light.\n\nThree previous attempts have ended in Starship's fiery destruction, all part of what the company says is an acceptable cost in its rapid trial-and-error approach to development.\n\n\"The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said in a statement.\n\nSuper Heavy is the booster, while Starship refers to both the upper stage and the two stages combined.\n\nThe flight path will be similar to the third test, which took place in March and saw Starship fly halfway around the globe before it was eventually lost as it re-entered the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean, 49 minutes into the mission.\n\nSince then SpaceX says it has made several software and hardware upgrades and hopes to achieve a soft splashdown for the booster stage in the Gulf of Mexico, and a \"controlled entry\" for the upper stage.\n\nDesigned to eventually be fully reusable, Starship stands 397 feet (121 meters) tall with both stages combined -- 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty.\n\nIts Super Heavy booster produces 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, almost double that of the world's second most powerful rocket, NASA's Space Launch System -- though the latter is now certified, while Starship is still under development.\n\nSpaceX's strategy of carrying out tests in the real world rather than in labs has paid off in the past.\n\nIts Falcon 9 rockets have come to be workhorses for NASA and the commercial sector, its Dragon capsule sends astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, and its Starlink internet satellite constellation now covers dozens of countries.\n\nBut the clock is ticking for SpaceX to be ready for NASA's planned return of astronauts to the Moon in 2026, using a modified Starship as the lander vehicle.\n\nTo accomplish this, SpaceX will need to first place a Starship in orbit, then refuel it with multiple \"Starship tankers\" for its onward journey -- a complex engineering feat that has never before been accomplished.\n\nAt least one SpaceX fan has grown tired of waiting. Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa announced this week he has canceled a planned trip around the Moon on Starship with a crew of artists, because he has no idea when it might actually happen.", "source": {"uri": "legit.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Legit.ng - Nigeria news."}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@legit.ng", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusaku_Maezawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yusaku Maezawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ff85459e333d604a.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

In its latest launch, the company achieved a key milestone in its Starship flight test campaign: returning the booster and the upper stage back to Earth in controlled ocean splashdowns.\n\nBringing the two parts of the launch vehicle back -- the Super Heavy booster and the upper stage, which is also called Starship -- are essential to the company's long-term plans to make Starship the first-ever fully reusable rocket. But to reuse, you have to recover, and SpaceX is proving that it will be able to do just that with Starship.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to fly Super Heavy and the Starship upper stage back to Starbase, SpaceX's private Starship launch and development site in southeast Texas, where they'd make vertical landings on solid ground. A controlled ocean splashdown is the first step toward executing this plan. SpaceX was the first company to ever reuse a part of a rocket that's flown to space, but even its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket is only partially reusable (the second stage is expended in orbit).\n\nStarship lifted off from Starbase at 8:50 AM CT, the fourth launch in the rocket test campaign. SpaceX aims to use the rocket to launch heavier versions of its Starlink satellites, deliver astronauts to the moon for NASA, and eventually make life multi-planetary.\n\nAlthough this is only the fourth time that the mammoth Starship has ever launched to orbit, the test went remarkably smoothly. Only one of the 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy booster went out, and the company completed its novel \"hot-staging\" stage separation technique. (During hot staging, the engines on the upper stage ignite temporarily while it is still attached to the booster, essentially helping to 'push' the booster away.) SpaceX also successfully jettisoned the \"hot stage ring\" that sits in between Starship and Super Heavy for the first time, in order to reduce the weight of the booster as it returns to Earth.\n\nShortly after launch, the booster successfully splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico. A little over an hour after launch, Starship followed suit, surviving the extreme heat from traveling through the Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds and splashing down in the Indian Ocean.\n\nOf the 18,000 heat shield tiles on the ship, engineers intentionally replaced one with a thinner version and removed two tiles completely in order to \"measure how hot things get without tiles in those locations, while also testing some thermal protection options,\" the company said. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk later said on X that the ship successfully splashed down despite having a damaged flap and losing \"many tiles.\" Musk has said before that the heatshield system is \"the biggest remaining problem\" in Starship development.\n\nStarship has come a long way since its first orbital test flight in April 2023 -- that launch saw the mid-air explosion of both parts of the rocket and the dysfunction of many of the rocket engines. Each subsequent test has gone further, and Starship reached orbit for the first time in the third test this past March.

SpaceX also sent a command to Starship to reignite its engines just before splashing down in the ocean, a maneuver designed to slow it down and reorient it before impact. The engines appeared to reignite on the company's livestream, but it's unclear how smoothly that maneuver went.\n\nHaving Starship survive the plunge through the atmosphere was the biggest objective for SpaceX ahead of this test flight.\n\nElon Musk eventually plans to bring Starship it into regular commercial operation as a reusable rocket, but it still has a long way to go until people can take trips to deep space. This will require landing the spacecraft in one piece, life support systems and how to refuel in orbit.\n\nA few minutes into the flight, the Super Heavy booster, used to propel Starship toward orbit, separated as planned and fell back down to Earth. The booster then fired its engines a final time to slow its impact just before touching down softly in the Gulf of Mexico -- achieving a new milestone and igniting cheers inside SpaceX mission control.\n\nSpaceX's Starship - billed as the most powerful rocket ever created - will eventually be used to launch SpaceX's larger, upgraded Starlink satellites. Ultimately it is intended to further Musk's ambitions of sending cargo and people to destinations like the moon, and, eventually, Mars.\n\nDepending on how satisfied SpaceX is with Thursday's demonstration, it's possible the company may move forward with trying to land portions of Starship on land during the next test flight.\n\n\"If the landing on the virtual tower with the booster works, then we will actually try with flight five to come back and land on the tower,\" Musk told employees in April at its Starbase facility in Texas.\n\n\"That's very much a success oriented schedule, but it is in the realm of possibility,\" Musk said.\n\nStanding nearly 400 feet (122 meters) high, the Starship launch system is taller than the Saturn V that sent Neil Armstrong to the moon. SpaceX holds a multibillion-dollar NASA contract to land people on the surface of the moon with Starship. NASA is closely monitoring SpaceX's progress with each Starship launch, with the goal of landing astronauts on the moon as early as 2026. However, that timeline is likely to be delayed.\n\nSpaceX didn't plan to recover Starship or its Super Heavy booster on this flight. It wasn't immediately clear whether the Federal Aviation Administration would open up a mishap investigation into Thursday's mission, which the US agency has done in the past when Starship broke apart or caused damage. However, prior to the flight, the FAA laid out various possible outcomes that would not trigger a mishap investigation, and the flight seemed to meet that criteria.\n\nAn FAA spokesman said that the agency was assessing the operation, and would let the public know later whether an investigation is warranted.\n\nSpaceX has been able to improve incrementally with each successive test launch of Starship. During the first two flights -- in April 2023 and in November -- the vehicle prematurely exploded before being able to perform the majority of the mission goals.\n\nFor SpaceX, these test flights are all part of Starship's development process, with the company not necessarily expecting fully successful launches but with hopes of pushing the envelope further with each new mission.\n\nSubscribe to Business of Space: The inside stories of investments beyond Earth, from satellite networks to moon landings.

Its first two tries in 2023 both ended explosively before the partial success in February.\n\n\"Starship's third flight test made tremendous strides towards a future of rapidly reliable reusable rockets,\" the company posted on its website. \"The test completed several exciting firsts, including the first Starship reentry from space, the first-ever opening and closing of Starship's payload door in space, and a successful propellant transfer demonstration.\"\n\nThe propellant transfer is necessary for SpaceX's planned use in NASA's Artemis program so a version of Starship can act as the human landing system for the Artemis III mission as soon as 2026. After launch from Earth, the spacecraft will need to refuel in space to get to the moon. The same technology would enable deeper space travel as well, including SpaceX's ultimate goal of getting Starship to Mars.\n\n\"The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,\" the company posted. \"The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship.\"\n\nBuilding off of the third flight's shortcomings, the company made upgrades to both software and hardware as well as changes to launch operations to up the ship's reliability, the company stated.\n\nThe flight path will be similar to launch No. 3 aiming for the upper stage to splash down in the Indian Ocean, without the need for a deorbit burn, \"maximizing public safety while still providing the opportunity to meet our primary objective of a controlled Starship reentry.\"\n\n\"The fourth flight of Starship will aim to bring us closer to the rapidly reusable future on the horizon,\" the company stated. \"We're continuing to rapidly develop Starship, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as quickly as possible as we build a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, Mars and beyond.\"\n\nWhile test flights continue in Texas, SpaceX plans to potentially build out Starship launch sites at both Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of the Air Force are both heading up environmental impact studies to gauge the effect of launching what is the most powerful rocket to ever make it to orbit.\n\nThe powerful rocket nearly doubles the power of NASA's Space

This was deemed as a major milestone for the prototype system that may one day send humans to Mars.\n\nThe most powerful rocket ever built blasted off from the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas at 7:50 am (1250 GMT). It then entered the orbit, soaring halfway across the globe. The journey lasted around an hour and five minutes.\n\nThe rocket successfully survived the reentry through Earth's atmosphere and splashed down in the Indian Ocean as planned during its fourth test mission after launching from south Texas.\n\n\"Splashdown confirmed! Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting fourth flight test of Starship!,\" SpaceX posted in X on Thursday. Meanwhile, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk posted, \"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\"\n\nThe company had earlier said, \"If Starship manages to make it all the way to reentry, we'll collect valuable data on the vehicle at hypersonic speeds, or more than 5x the speed of sound.\"\n\nThursday's flight was a significant feat for SpaceX's Starship, as the three previous attempts ended in its fiery destruction. It was the fourth launch of the world's biggest and most powerful rocket, standing nearly 400 feet (121 meters) tall.\n\n\"This time, the rocket and the spacecraft managed to splash down in a controlled fashion, making the hourlong flight the longest and most successful yet,\" news agency Associated Press reported.\n\nSpaceX had earlier said the Starship, on its fourth test, will fly a similar trajectory as the previous flight test, with a targeted splashdown of the Ship in the Indian Ocean. \"The fourth flight of Starship will aim to bring us closer to the rapidly reusable future on the horizon,\" it added.\n\nSparks and debris flew off the spaceship as it came down over the Indian Ocean northwest of Australia, dramatic video captured by an onboard camera showed, even as it succeeded in its goal of surviving atmospheric re-entry, news agency AFP reported.\n\nDuring the last test in March, the spaceship managed to fly for 49 minutes before it was lost as it careened into the atmosphere at around 27,000 kilometers per hour (nearly 17,000 mph). Since then SpaceX made several software and hardware upgrades.\n\nOn Thursday it also succeeded in the first soft splashdown for the first stage booster called Super Heavy, in the Gulf of Mexico, to massive applause from engineers at mission control in Hawthorne in California.\n\n\"Congratulations SpaceX on Starship's successful test flight this morning!\" NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on X. \"We are another step closer to returning humanity to the Moon through #Artemis - then looking onward to Mars.\"\n\nDesigned to eventually be fully reusable, Starship stands 397 feet (121 meters) tall with both stages combined - 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty. Its Super Heavy booster produces 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rockets used during the Apollo missions - though later versions should be more powerful still..\n\nYou are on Mint!

The uncrewed test today was the fourth launch of the Starship to date, following a third test in March in which the Starship launched, but was lost during reentry.\n\nThe rocket launched from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Texas at around 9 a.m. ET this morning, Thursday January 6. The Starship lifted off from Texas and traveled through the atmosphere. It then flew over the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. It traveled for around 40 minutes. The ship then came back through the atmosphere for a reentry, splashing down in the Indian Ocean.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nLiftoff of Starship! pic.twitter.com/2Z1PdNPYPG\n\n&mdash; SpaceX (@SpaceX) June 6, 2024\n\nDuring the descent, debris was visible streaming off one of the Starship's flaps, which blocked camera views of the ship as it came through the atmosphere. \"It's potentially hanging on by a couple of bolts and threads,\" the commentators said, as the vehicle was clearly experiencing damage on the way down. However, SpaceX emphasized that the aim of the test was to collect data on the vehicle, and that was possible even though it was not fully intact.\n\n\"Ultimately, the data is the payload today,\" SpaceX commentators said. \"The goal was to get as far through this high heat reentry as possible.\"\n\nThe flip maneuver, in which the Starship flips itself into a vertical position, did appear to be executed as the vehicle came down in an upright position, at least at one point. The ship did perform a landing burn, which is the first time the Starship has gotten this far in its process.\n\nThe test also included the separation of the first stage, or booster, which provides propulsion to the Starship as it rises through Earth's atmosphere. Like on SpaceX's flagship rocket, the Falcon 9, the idea is for the Starship's booster to be ejected once it is no longer needed, and then to land either in the ocean or on land so it can be reused. Falcon 9 rockets now successfully land and reuse boosters on a routine basis, which helps to reduce costs in the long run. Today's test included the first successful splashdown of Starship's first stage, called the Super Heavy booster, which splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nOverall, the fourth test flight of the Starship will be hailed as a success, with the vehicle making it off the ground, into the air, and back down to Earth again, though more work will need to be done to make it safe for regular use. Still, the test shows significant progress from previous tests and will inspire hopes for the next round of testing.\n\n\"That was incredible!\" said SpaceX's Dan Huot as the Starship performed its landing maneuever. \"I can't wait for the next one.\"\n\nEditors' Recommendations How to watch SpaceX launch Starship megarocket on fourth test flight Elon Musk says Starship is ready to fly, but one thing stands in the way SpaceX reveals target date for next test of Starship megarocket Watch this SpaceX Raptor engine blow up during testing SpaceX's Starlink internet service reaches milestone", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "georgina_torbet@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Georgina Torbet", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Payload"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falcon 9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Testing_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Testing and Tools", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Software", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Software", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-06-145159.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 472, "textEnd": 481}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

(SpaceX via Reuters)\n\nSpaceX's Starship rocket survived a fiery, hypersonic return from space and achieved a breakthrough landing demonstration in the Indian Ocean on Thursday, completing a full test mission around the globe on the rocket's fourth try.\n\nStarship's controlled plunge into the Indian Ocean just 65 minutes after launching from Texas capped the latest advance in the company's test-to-failure rocket development campaign, a multibillion-dollar effort by Elon Musk's space company to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander.\n\nThe three previous test missions ended with Starship blowing up or disintegrating.\n\nThe two-stage, nearly 400-foot tall rocket system, consisting of the Starship vessel mounted atop its towering Super Heavy rocket booster, blasted off from the company's Starbase launch site near Boca Chica Village in South Texas, sending powerful shockwaves rippling through the Gulf Coast's morning fog.\n\nSuper Heavy detached from the Starship upper stage at an altitude of 74 km (46 miles), as Starship ignited its own engines to ascend further toward space. Meanwhile, Super Heavy returned to the Gulf of Mexico and nailed a soft splashdown, demonstrating a touchdown that would otherwise be on land.\n\nIn space, a SpaceX live stream showed Starship, outfitted with onboard cameras, coasting around 16,000 miles (25,750 km)per hour at roughly 200 km in altitude as it made its way toward the Indian Ocean for a return to Earth, setting up for a key demonstration in its reusable design.\n\nThe rocket's first launch in April 2023 exploded minutes after liftoff some 25 miles (40 km) above ground, while its second attempt in November blew up after reaching space. The rocket's third test flight in March made it much farther but broke apart during atmospheric reentry some 64 km (40 miles) over the Indian Ocean.\n\nOn Thursday, Starship appeared to have overcome those past technical challenges. Beginning at about 45 minutes into flight, onboard cameras showed a field of superhot plasma forming around Starship's exterior -- marking with hues of orange, red, bluish purple, and green the start of the spaceship's blazing hot plunge through Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAs Starship's descent was slowed by violent atmospheric friction, bits of metal and its hexagonal heat-shield tiles began flying off and parts of the rocket's steering flaps were stripped to a skeleton, though they remained functional.\n\nStarship reignited an engine to flip itself upright in mid-descent, as it would for a landing on ground or on the moon, then splashed into the Indian Ocean, as confirmed by waves of water seen through an onboard camera's broken, debris-covered lens.\n\n'Starship made it all the way'\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who had said Starship's reentry was the mission's biggest goal, posted on social media after the splashdown.\n\nThe rocket was partly covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.\n\nDesigned to be cheaper and more powerful than SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, Starship represents the future of the company's dominant satellite launch and astronaut business. It is due to be used by NASA in the next few years to land the first astronauts on the moon since 1972.\n\nMuch is riding on SpaceX's development of Starship, relied upon by NASA as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026 in a rivalry with China, which plans to send its astronauts there by 2030. China has made several recent advances in its lunar program, including a second landing on the moon's far side in a sample retrieval mission.\n\nDespite Starship's development appearing quicker than other rocket programs, it has been slower than Musk originally envisioned. A Japanese billionaire who in 2018 paid to fly Starship around the moon, at the time expected to occur last year, canceled his flight last week, citing schedule uncertainties.\n\nMusk's drive to rapidly build Starship has endangered SpaceX workers in Texas and California, a Reuters investigation found.\n\nMusk, who founded SpaceX in 2002, has said Starship must launch hundreds of times before it carries humans, suggesting it could be years before the rocket flies crews or lands astronauts on the lunar surface.\n\nSpaceX routinely flies astronauts to and from the International Space Station in low-Earth orbit for NASA using its Crew Dragon capsule, which launches atop the company's Falcon 9 rocket. No private company has ever sent humans to the moon.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Previous attempts have ended in explosions or disintegration. This mission's goal is to advance SpaceX's satellite and astronaut launch capabilities, crucial for NASA's lunar missions.\n\nSpaceX's giant Starship rocket launched from south Texas on Thursday for its fourth test toward space to execute a tricky primary objective: survive a blazingly hot re-entry through Earth's atmosphere, the violent phase where the rocket broke apart during its last attempt. The two-stage spacecraft, consisting of the Starship cruise vessel mounted atop its towering Super Heavy rocket booster, blasted off from the company's Starbase launch site near Boca Chica Village on the Gulf Coast of Texas. It is the latest trial mission in the test-to-failure rocket development campaign of Elon Musk's company.\n\nDesigned to be cheaper and more powerful than SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, Starship - standing nearly 400 feet (122 meters) tall - represents the future of the company's dominant satellite launch and astronaut business. It is due to be used by NASA in the next few years to land the first astronauts on the moon since 1972. Each Starship rocket has made it farther in its testing objectives than previous tests before failing, either by blowing up or disintegrating in the atmosphere.\n\nThe rocket's first launch in April 2023 exploded minutes after liftoff some 25 miles (40 km) above ground. During the next attempt in November, Starship reached space for the first time but exploded soon after. In its most recent flight in March, Starship made it much farther and broke apart in Earth's atmosphere as it attempted to return from space halfway around the globe.\n\nThe rocket's flight on Thursday is a repeat of its previous test but with the aim to get farther. The rocket system's first stage, called Super Heavy, ignited its 33 Raptor engines to lift off, then was due to separate from the Starship second stage, which would then blast further into space.\n\nSuper Heavy is expected to re-ignite some engines and return toward the Gulf of Mexico for a \"soft splash-down\" to simulate a landing that would otherwise be on land. Meanwhile in space, Starship is expected to trek around the globe heading for the Indian Ocean to make a second attempt to survive the intense heat of atmospheric re-entry - the crucial point at which it failed in March.\n\nThe rocket is covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds. \"The main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during reentry, ideally through max heating,\" Musk, CEO of SpaceX, wrote on social media on Saturday.\n\nMuch is riding on SpaceX's development of Starship, relied upon by NASA as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026 in a rivalry with China, which plans to send its astronauts there by 2030. China has made several recent advances in its lunar program, including a second landing on the moon's far side in a sample retrieval mission. Despite Starship's development appearing quicker than other rocket programs, it has been slower than Musk originally envisioned. A Japanese billionaire who initially paid to fly Starship around the moon canceled his flight last week, citing schedule uncertainties.\n\nAnd Musk's drive to rapidly build Starship has endangered SpaceX workers in Texas and California, a Reuters investigation found.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

Watch live on Thursday", "body": "SpaceX launched its colossal Starship rocket on its third major test flight, aiming to improve on past attempts that ended prematurely in explosions.\n\nSpaceX is gearing up for another Starship test flight on Thursday morning, marking the rocket's fourth time to deploy from the Lone Star State.\n\nThis attempt follows two failures and the somewhat successful flight earlier this year that stunned thousands of viewers after it completed nearly an entire test flight but failed during re-entry.\n\nThe fourth flight test will focus on the ability to return to Earth and reuse the spacecraft, according to the website.\n\n\"The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship,\" the website states.\n\nWhere in Texas is SpaceX launching from?\n\nStarship, SpaceX's most powerful rocket, is prepping its launch from the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, a beach town that sits off the Gulf of Mexico about 20 miles from the border.\n\nHow to watch SpaceX Starship launch\n\nThe fourth Starship flight test is scheduled to launch from Starbase around 7 a.m. local time. A live webcast will begin around 30 minutes before liftoff and will stream on X (formerly known as Twitter) and the SpaceX website.\n\nThe fourth flight test of Starship is targeted to launch Thursday, June 6, from Starbase in Texas. The 120-minute test window opens at 7:00 a.m. CT.\n\nA live webcast of the flight test will begin about 30 minutes before liftoff, which you can watch here and on X @SpaceX. The launch window will open as early as 7 a.m. CT. As is the case with all developmental testing, the schedule is dynamic and likely to change, so be sure to stay tuned to our X account for updates.\n\nWhat happened during the previous SpaceX launch in Texas?\n\nIn the most recent attempt on March 14, SpaceX employees cheered and clapped with excitement, praising the journey as \"phenomenal\" as it entered space and continued its flight for more than 45 minutes before crumbling upon its return to Earth.\n\nAs the spacecraft neared its planned splashdown in the Indian Ocean, about an hour after its launch from a South Texas beach, the live video feed showed a vibrant glow around the spacecraft. SpaceX later confirmed that the spacecraft had caught fire and incinerated during re-entry before plummeting into the ocean.\n\nStill, that was the furthest Starship had traveled, and employees deemed it a success. The eventual goal is for the spacecraft to carry astronauts to the moon and further.\n\n\"Starship's third flight test made tremendous strides towards a future of rapidly reliable reusable rockets,\" the SpaceX website states. \"The test completed several exciting firsts, including the first Starship reentry from space, the first ever opening and the closing of Starship's payload door in space, and a successful propellant transfer demonstration.\"\n\nSpaceX launched its first Starship test flight in April 2023, but the vehicle encountered issues only 24 miles above the Gulf of Mexico when leaking propellant caused a fire in the Super Heavy booster, according to a story in Florida Today. This caused SpaceX to lose communication and control of the vehicle, but the Autonomous Flight Safety System took over and it detonated in less than four minutes.\n\nIn November, the Starship took flight again, reaching space for the first time, according to the SpaceX website. However, it encountered issues with the liquid oxygen supply during the flight, resulting in the failure of one engine and causing the vehicle to ignite into flames.\n\nAccording to the SpaceX website, the failure was \"determined to be filter blockage where liquid oxygen is supplied to the engines, leading to a loss of inlet pressure in engine oxidizer pumps that eventually resulted in one engine failing in a way that resulted in the loss of the vehicle.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.statesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA TODAY"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_american_statesman@eu.statesman.com", "name": "Austin American-Statesman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_propellant_depot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbital propellant depot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Range safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidizing_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxidizing agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payload"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquid oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/03/25/NAAS/73088147007-starbase.jpg?auto=webp&crop=959,541,x0,y89&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1372, "textEnd": 1378}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 1865, "textEnd": 1873}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

And for that, dear space fans, we've got what you need.\n\nSpaceX is targeting an 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) launch for its Starship Flight 4 test flight of the Starship and Super Heavy megarocket from the company's Starbase facility in South Texas. While that time could change a bit ahead of launch, it's a great target to time your watch party.\n\nSpaceX will offer a free live webcast of the Starship Flight 4 launch beginning at about 7:30 a.m. EDT (1130 GMT). You can watch the livestream here at Space.com, courtesy of SpaceX. Here's a look at exactly when and how to watch Starship's next launch.\n\nStarship Die Cast Rocket Model Now $69.99 on Amazon.\n\nIf you can't see SpaceX's Starship in person, you can score a model of your own. Standing at 13.77 inches (35 cm), this is a 1:375 ratio of SpaceX's Starship as a desktop model. The materials here are alloy steel and it weighs just 225g.\n\nNote: Stock is low so you'll have to act quickly to get this. View Deal\n\nCurrently, SpaceX's Starship Flight 4 is scheduled to launch at 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT), or 7 a.m. CDT from the company's Starbase test site near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. However, SpaceX has a 120-minute window in which to launch the Flight 4 mission, so Starship could lift off anytime between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT).\n\n\"As is the case with all developmental testing, the schedule is dynamic and likely to change, so be sure to stay tuned to our X account for updates,\" SpaceX wrote in a mission description.\n\nStarship and its Super Heavy booster are the world's most powerful rocket. When stacked together, they stand nearly 400 feet tall (122 meters) tall, with the first stage powered by 33 Raptor engines and the Starship upper stage by six Raptors.\n\nThe Starship launch system is designed to be fully reusable and fly to deep-space destinations like the moon, Mars or beyond, SpaceX has said. NASA has picked Starship to land its Artemis 3 astronauts on the moon in late 2026. But before Starship can land on the moon, it has to reach space and prove it can reenter safely. That's what Flight 4 is about.\n\n\"The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said in the mission description. SpaceX has launched three test flights, so far, with the first two failing to reach space. Starship Flight 3 reached space, but both the Starship and Super Heavy stages broke apart while coming back to Earth.\n\nRelated: See our SpaceX Starship and Super Heavy guide for a detailed look\n\nYes, you will be able to watch SpaceX's Starship Flight 4 launch online, and you'll have your pick on where to watch.\n\nThe first and most obvious place to watch the launch will be on SpaceX's X account (formerly Twitter), starting 30 minutes before liftoff -- so, at about 7:30 a.m. EDT (1130 GMT).\n\nSpace.com will carry SpaceX's livestream live on our own VideoFromSpace YouTube channel, as well as on our homepage and at the top of this page.\n\nIf you're looking to check on SpaceX's Flight 4 status BEFORE SpaceX's livestream, consider tuning into to NASASpaceflight.com's YouTube channel, which offers live views of SpaceX's Starship, Starbase pads and other locations, and will likely offer live commentary during the fueling process.\n\nIf you happen to be in or near the Boca Chica, Texas area and are hoping to watch Starship launch in person, you have several locations you can choose from.\n\nSpaceX does not have an official viewing site, but you can visit several public beaches to see the launch. The nearby South Padre Island offers clear views of the rocket from the shoreline near the Cameron County Amphitheater and Isla Blanca Park. You can also find similar beachfront viewing spots along the nearby shore of Port Isabel.\n\nI actually watched Starship Flight 1's launch in April 2023 from South Padre Island's Cameron County Amphitheater, and I can assure you that it offers unobstructed views (aside from some boats in the harbor) to spectators on the beach. (There is also a public restroom, always a plus.) You'll want to bring a folding chair, water, sunscreen and other supplies. Traffic can be heavy to and from the site, so consider that in your travel planning.\n\nSpaceX's Starship Flight 4 is expected to last just over one hour, if all goes according to plan.\n\nFlight 4 will fly a similar trajectory to SpaceX's Starship Flight 3 launch on March 14, which aimed for a 65-minute mission from launch to Starship splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\n\"This flight path does not require a deorbit burn for reentry, maximizing public safety while still providing the opportunity to meet our primary objective of a controlled Starship reentry,\" SpaceX wrote in its mission description.\n\nThe Super Heavy booster, meanwhile, is expected to fly for nearly 7 minutes, with a landing burn scheduled for 6 minutes, 43 seconds after liftoff. SpaceX hopes it will make a controlled \"landing\" and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, miles offshore of Boca Chica Beach.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n-- SpaceX launches giant Starship rocket into space on epic 3rd test flight (video)\n\n-- Starship and Super Heavy: SpaceX's Mars transportation system\n\n-- SpaceX's Starship could help this start-up beam clean energy from space.

Those closures run from 12 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time, or about 1 a.m. to 3 p.m. EDT, on both days.\n\nOf course, any backup launch attempt would depend on how far SpaceX goes into the Starship and Super Heavy fueling process. In the past, SpaceX has said it takes several days to restock the more than 10 million pounds of super-cold liquid methane and liquid oxygen propellant needed for launch.\n\nIf a technical issue delays the launch of Starship Flight 4, then SpaceX would likely have to wait until it is solved to try again.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alloy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artemis 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Padre_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Padre Island"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameron County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cameron County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Isabel,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port Isabel, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Isabel, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KCO2yMdI.N26L4IavXC0WA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/space_311/5a018d3786b0b5a744ad83567a28b3bc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "dateEnd": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 5742, "textEnd": 5759}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 94, "textEnd": 100, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 4604, "textEnd": 4612}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Most notably, the spacecraft made a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean, a feat that it had yet to accomplish.\n\nThis was the first successful reentry for the Starship rocket. The first two test flights, which took place last year, resulted in the rocket exploding. A third flight, in March, was more fruitful, but the rocket eventually burned up over the ocean during its return to Earth. On Thursday, along with the rocket splashing down, the vehicle's booster similarly landed softly in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe Starship rocket is an important part of Musk's plans for SpaceX, as well as American space travel more broadly. NASA is planning to use the craft to return astronauts to the moon during its upcoming Artemis mission. Because of delays with developing Starship, though, that program has been pushed back until at least September 2026.\n\nPersonally, Musk is looking to use Starship to make SpaceX an even more productive company. He's hoping that the 400-foot-tall rocket will help SpaceX launch more satellites for its Starlink internet, send a space station and moon rovers into the cosmos, and even take people to Mars, the WSJ noted. Before any of that can happen, though, SpaceX needs to prove that Starship can carry out its most basic of functions.\n\nThis week's test flight is a reassuring move in that direction. Being able to safely return the spacecraft and the booster is key to making Starship reusable. On Thursday, despite the extreme heat and pressure that worked against the rocket upon reentry, Starship was able to make a controlled landing. Yet, some debris did come off the vehicle, the rocket lost many tiles, and a flap was damaged.\n\nEven still, it's clear that SpaceX is getting closer and closer to its final goal when it comes to Starship. In just a couple of years, we may get to see a group of astronauts -- decked out in their Prada spacesuits -- head to the moon via the rocket. And some years after that, perhaps we ourselves will be soaring toward Mars aboard the Starship craft.", "source": {"uri": "robbreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Robb Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tori_latham@robbreport.com", "name": "Tori Latham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artemis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_rover", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mars rover"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Pyrotechnics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Pyrotechnics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Paper", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Paper", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://robbreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SpaceX-Starship-Launch.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The US space agency plans to use Starship for its Artemis III mission to return humans to the Moon by 2026.\n\nMr Musk, meanwhile, believes the rocket system could be used to take humans to Mars and beyond.\n\nThe livestream has now ended but you can rewatch the launch below:\n\nThank you for joining us and we look forward to seeing you again for SpaceX's next Starship mission.\n\nSenator Bill Nelson, the administrator of NASA, has congratulated SpaceX on completing several crucial milestones for its mission to the Moon:\n\nStarship made it all the way to a soft landing in the sea, Elon Musk has said.\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\"\n\nWith that, it appears today's launch went almost totally as planned, a huge boost for SpaceX as it aims to take people to the Moon in less than two years.\n\nStill, the rocket appeared to suffer some substantial damage to its flaps on its final descent, suggesting there are still significant changes needed before its next flight.\n\nThe rocket was ultimately lost as planned at sea, but just getting that far represents a major leap forward.\n\nIn mission control, Musk celebrates the return of Starship\n\nDespite losing camera footage thanks to a cracked and damaged lens, Starship appeared to make it almost all the way back to Earth - returning to sub-sonic speeds and attempting its flip manoeuvre and landing burn.\n\nWhile the picture was almost totally lost for the last few minutes thanks to debris damaging the camera, the test looked like an almost total success for SpaceX.\n\nThe rocket splashed down as hoped in the Indian Ocean, firing up its engines and hitting the sea.\n\nWe thought we had lost her... Starship's cameras briefly stopped working but the livestream is back and the rocket still appears to be in one piece - for now!\n\nStarship is hurtling to Earth with plasma all around, although the rocket's flaps are beginning to disintegrate... suggesting it may not make it back in one piece...\n\nThe rocket will begin falling at five miles per second, creating a blanket of plasma around the ship that will lead to a communications blackout.\n\nSo while there are some updates now, the feed could soon lose signal again - the ship is currently travelling at more than 25,000 kilometres per hour.\n\nThe rocket is continuing to sail through space preparing for re-entry.\n\nThe billionaire seems happy with the progress of the mission so far after Starship's Superheavy engine returned to Earth.\n\nStarship blasted off as planned at 1.50pm, successfully reaching space on its fourth test flight:\n\nSuperheavy plunged back to Earth before its Raptor engines reignited and slowed its descent for a soft landing at sea:\n\nSpaceX's livestream is taking a break while the rocket coasts through space and we await its return to Earth's atmosphere.\n\nSpaceX's superheavy rocket has landed successfully in the Gulf of Mexico for the first time, conducting a \"soft\" splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWhile the rocket has now been lost, getting back to Earth more-or-less in one piece was crucial for SpaceX as it demonstrates the vehicle can be re-used.\n\nStarship's Superheavy booster has successfully disconnected and has begun falling back to Earth...\n\nThis moment is critcal for SpaceX, which is hoping it can guide the Superheavy rocket back to the planet and land it for re-use.\n\nFor now, the booster rocket will try to land \"softly\" in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe moment of maximum strain on the rocket... it is now flying faster than the speed of sound\n\nStarship just a few minutes from launch, SpaceX can hold the launch for up to 30 minutes in the event of any last minute concerns.\n\nSpaceX has a guide on how today's flight is expected to go - should things go to plan:\n\nSpaceX has begun its live coverage of the upcoming Starship launch:\n\nSpaceX has Tweeted that its rocket has been given the go-ahead to start loading propellant:\n\nSpaceX has designed Starship to be a reusable rocket, meaning the craft can return to Earth after completing its mission. Using its engines, the rocket should be able to land vertically after plummeting down from orbit.\n\nThe launch time for Starship has been pushed back until 1.50pm, SpaceX has said, eating into the two hour launch window which starts as 7.00 am local time.\n\nHowever, weather conditions appear fine in Texas, with SpaceX saying they are \"95pc favourable\".\n\n11:48 AM BST\n\nMore details on Musk's superheavy Starship rocket\n\nMade up of two stages, Starship is the tallest rocket ever built at nearly 400 ft and the heaviest launcher to reach space.\n\nThe lower booster section, which stands 232 ft tall, will separate after just over two minutes of flying time, and in theory should then be able to return to earth on its own power. The Super Heavy section has 33 Raptor engines, with 13 in the centre and 20 around the perimeter.\n\nThe upper Starship module is 165 ft tall and has its own engines and is designed to return to Earth's atmosphere after reaching space.\n\n11:20 AM BST\n\nBoeing successfully launches crewed Starliner\n\nWhile SpaceX is going to be making all the headlines, there was another landmark space launch this week worthy of note.\n\nOn Wednesday, Boeing and rocket business ULA completed a successful first launch of Boeing's Starliner rocket carrying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams on a mission to the International Space Station.\n\nThe launch had been long delayed after a series of technical hitches, but it marks a crucial moment in Boeing and ULA's effort to challenge SpaceX.\n\nThe Starliner craft is expected to reach the ISS later today. Elon Musk was quick to congratulate his rival's on their successful blast off.\n\nAfter three previous missions focused on getting Starship into space, today's flight will test out technologies aimed at getting it back in one piece.\n\nCritical to SpaceX's technology are reusable boosters and rocket modules, which can return to earth in their own power and land vertically using their engines.\n\nThe company has already demonstrated the system on its smaller Falcon 9 rockets, which can land back on earth or at sea.\n\nAnd welcome to our coverage of today's Starship launch.\n\nIt is bright and early in Boca Chica, Texas, and the giant rocket is on the launchpad ready for a two-hour launch window this afternoon - starting at 1pm British Summer Time.\n\nThis morning's test is critical for realising NASA's goal of returning mankind to the Moon for the first time in 50 years.

SpaceX lost contact with Starship 49 minutes into the flight test as it neared splashdown in the Indian Ocean, which was its ultimate goal. The launch vehicle's booster -- though it seamlessly separated from the spacecraft -- plummeted into the Gulf while Starship went on to reach an altitude of some 145 miles. The two previous flight tests ended in explosions, though SpaceX has said each endeavor completed major milestones and led to invaluable data.\n\nThursday's flight test is set to take a similar trajectory to the third, as SpaceX seeks to land Starship in the Indian Ocean via splashdown.\n\nFor the fourth flight test, SpaceX said in a statement that its focus will turn from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability for Starship and its Super Heavy booster to return to Earth and be reused. Primary objectives include executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf for the booster, as well as a controlled entry of Starship, according to SpaceX.\n\nTo accomplish this, several software and hardware upgrades have been made to increase overall reliability and address lessons learned from Flight 3.

But on Thursday, the California-based company is hoping for a full successful fourth test flight.\n\nCountdown to launch\n\nSpaceX confirmed that the launch time would be at 8 a.m. ET and it will happen at the company's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas.\n\nLearning about Starship\n\nThe purpose of Starship is to return humans to the moon and ultimately, to the red planet, Mars. In fact, it will be used for the Artemis III mission.\n\nIt is a two-stage heavy lift launch rocket that will be a fully reusable transportation system to carry humans and cargo into space.\n\nSuper Heavy is the rocket booster part of the vehicle while the spacecraft is called Starship. Collectively, they are known as Starship.\n\nBoth the Super Heavy rocket, with its 33 Raptor engines fueled by thousands of tons of sub-cooled liquid oxygen and liquid methane, and the Starship are designed to be reusable.\n\nStarship is designed to carry 100 people, plus cargo, to low Earth orbit, the moon and Mars, according to the ship's user guide.\n\n\"The crew configuration of Starship includes private cabins, large common areas, centralized storage, solar storm shelters and a viewing gallery,\" revealed the six-page guide.\n\nWhat to expect for the fourth-test flight\n\nFor the fourth test, SpaceX stated it will build on the three prior launches and plans to showoff a series of presentations.\n\n\"The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy. The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship,\" SpaceX explained.\n\nThe Starship spacecraft is expected to splash down in the Indian Ocean, which is a similar trajectory from the last mission.\n\nSince the last flight in March of this year, SpaceX stated it has made software and hardware upgrades to improve the reliability of the spacecraft.\n\n\"The SpaceX team will also implement operational changes, including the jettison of the Super Heavy's hot-stage following boostback to reduce booster mass for the final phase of flight,\" stated the company.\n\nStarship's flight history\n\nThe first launch attempt of Starship happened on April 2023, which saw a series of failures that caused the rocket to explode.\n\nThe FAA issued a series of conditions before the California-based company could try again, which included 63 corrective actions.\n\nFor the second test in November 2023, SpaceX was forced to blow up Starship.\n\nThe new stage separation, called hot stage separation, worked as constructed, but it caused the Super Heavy rocket's destruction.\n\n\"Following stage separation, Super Heavy initiated its boostback burn, which sends commands to 13 of the vehicle's 33 Raptor engines to propel the rocket toward its intended landing location. During this burn, several engines began shutting down before one engine failed energetically, quickly cascading to a rapid unscheduled disassembly of the booster,\" SpaceX described.\n\nSpaceX believed the likely cause of the booster blowing up was a filter blockage where liquid oxygen fuel goes to the engines.\n\nMinutes later after the hot stage separation, SpaceX could not retrieve a signal to the Starship spacecraft and was forced to terminate it.\n\n\"A leak in the aft section of the spacecraft that developed when the liquid oxygen vent was initiated resulted in a combustion event and subsequent fires that led to a loss of communication between the spacecraft's flight computers. This resulted in a commanded shut down of all six engines prior to completion of the ascent burn, followed by the Autonomous Flight Safety System detecting a mission rule violation and activating the flight termination system, leading to vehicle breakup,\" the company explained.\n\nSpaceX stated it fixed 17 corrective actions that took place during the second flight attempt.\n\nThe third test took place in March 2024, and while it was not 100% a successful mission, SpaceX checked off a number of accomplishments, such as:\n\nBut as stated, it was not a fully successful mission. While 13 of the 33 Raptor engines of the Super Heavy lit up as designed following a stage separation so it can head towards the landing zone, six of the lit ones shut down, which triggered an early boost back shutdown.\n\nSince 13 engines were needed for the landing of the Super Heavy booster and only six shut down, that left seven, but only two could reach mainstage ignition. The booster did not survive the landing.\n\nBut SpaceX believes the cause of the issue was the continued filter blockage of the liquid oxygen that goes to the engines, the same incident that happened in the first test flight.\n\nFor the Starship spacecraft itself, for the most part it was functioning until 49 minutes into its mission.\n\n\"Several minutes after Starship began its coast phase, the vehicle began losing the ability to control its attitude. Starship continued flying its nominal trajectory but given the loss of attitude control, the vehicle automatically triggered a pre-planned command to skip its planned on-orbit relight of a single Raptor engine,\" SpaceX explained.\n\nWhile Starship was finally in space for the first time and providing important data to the SpaceX team, the lack of attitude control resulted in its final destruction.\n\n\"The most likely root cause of the unplanned roll was determined to be clogging of the valves responsible for roll control. SpaceX has since added additional roll control thrusters on upcoming Starships to improve attitude control redundancy and upgraded hardware for improved resilience to blockage,\" stated SpaceX.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_leone@baynews9.com", "name": "Anthony Leone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquid oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artemis 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy-lift_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavy-lift launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Range safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/03-13-2024_Starship_Super_Heavy", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

China has made several recent advances in its lunar programme, including a second landing on the moon's far side in a sample retrieval mission. -- Joey Roulette, (c) 2024 Reuters", "source": {"uri": "techcentral.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechCentral"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_landing_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soft landing (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_Village,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica Village, Texas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falcon 9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_speed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hypersonic speed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far side of the Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Education", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://techcentral.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/spacex-starship-1500-800.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

And for that, dear space fans, we've got what you need.\n\nSpaceX is targeting an 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) launch for its Starship Flight 4 test flight of the Starship and Super Heavy megarocket from the company's Starbase facility in South Texas. While that time could change a bit ahead of launch, it's a great target to time your watch party.\n\nSpaceX will offer a free live webcast of the Starship Flight 4 launch beginning at about 7:30 a.m. EDT (1130 GMT). You can watch the livestream here at Space.com, courtesy of SpaceX. Here's a look at exactly when and how to watch Starship's next launch.\n\nCurrently, SpaceX's Starship Flight 4 is scheduled to launch at 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT), or 7 a.m. CDT from the company's Starbase test site near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. However, SpaceX has a 120-minute window in which to launch the Flight 4 mission, so Starship could lift off anytime between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT).\n\n\"As is the case with all developmental testing, the schedule is dynamic and likely to change, so be sure to stay tuned to our X account for updates,\" SpaceX wrote in a mission description.\n\nStarship and its Super Heavy booster are the world's most powerful rocket. When stacked together, they stand nearly 400 feet tall (122 meters) tall, with the first stage powered by 33 Raptor engines and the Starship upper stage by six Raptors.\n\nThe Starship launch system is designed to be fully reusable and fly to deep-space destinations like the moon, Mars or beyond, SpaceX has said. NASA has picked Starship to land its Artemis 3 astronauts on the moon in late 2026. But before Starship can land on the moon, it has to reach space and prove it can reenter safely. That's what Flight 4 is about.\n\n\"The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said in the mission description. SpaceX has launched three test flights, so far, with the first two failing to reach space. Starship Flight 3 reached space, but both the Starship and Super Heavy stages broke apart while coming back to Earth.\n\nRelated: See our SpaceX Starship and Super Heavy guide for a detailed look\n\nYes, you will be able to watch SpaceX's Starship Flight 4 launch online, and you'll have your pick on where to watch.\n\nThe first and most obvious place to watch the launch will be on SpaceX's X account (formerly Twitter), starting 30 minutes before liftoff -- so, at about 7:30 a.m. EDT (1130 GMT).\n\nSpace.com will carry SpaceX's livestream live on our own VideoFromSpace YouTube channel, as well as on our homepage and at the top of this page.\n\nIf you're looking to check on SpaceX's Flight 4 status BEFORE SpaceX's livestream, consider tuning into to NASASpaceflight.com's YouTube channel, which offers live views of SpaceX's Starship, Starbase pads and other locations, and will likely offer live commentary during the fueling process.\n\nIf you happen to be in or near the Boca Chica, Texas area and are hoping to watch Starship launch in person, you have several locations you can choose from.\n\nSpaceX does not have an official viewing site, but you can visit several public beaches to see the launch. The nearby South Padre Island offers clear views of the rocket from the shoreline near the Cameron County Amphitheater and Isla Blanca Park. You can also find similar beachfront viewing spots along the nearby shore of Port Isabel.\n\nI actually watched Starship Flight 1's launch in April 2023 from South Padre Island's Cameron County Amphitheater, and I can assure you that it offers unobstructed views (aside from some boats in the harbor) to spectators on the beach. (There is also a public restroom, always a plus.) You'll want to bring a folding chair, water, sunscreen and other supplies. Traffic can be heavy to and from the site, so consider that in your travel planning.\n\nSpaceX's Starship Flight 4 is expected to last just over one hour, if all goes according to plan.\n\nFlight 4 will fly a similar trajectory to SpaceX's Starship Flight 3 launch on March 14, which aimed for a 65-minute mission from launch to Starship splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\n\"This flight path does not require a deorbit burn for reentry, maximizing public safety while still providing the opportunity to meet our primary objective of a controlled Starship reentry,\" SpaceX wrote in its mission description.\n\nThe Super Heavy booster, meanwhile, is expected to fly for nearly 7 minutes, with a landing burn scheduled for 6 minutes, 43 seconds after liftoff. SpaceX hopes it will make a controlled \"landing\" and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, miles offshore of Boca Chica Beach.\n\nIf SpaceX is unable to launch Starship Flight 4 on June 6, it's likely that the company has at least one (if not more) backup days to fall back on.\n\nOfficials with Cameron County, the region of South Texas that includes SpaceX's Starbase facility, have listed June 7 and June 8 as backup days, according to a beach closure advisory to the public. Those closures run from 12 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time, or about 1 a.m. to 3 p.m. EDT, on both days.\n\nOf course, any backup launch attempt would depend on how far SpaceX goes into the Starship and Super Heavy fueling process. In the past, SpaceX has said it takes several days to restock the more than 10 million pounds of super-cold liquid methane and liquid oxygen propellant needed for launch.\n\nIf a technical issue delays the launch of Starship Flight 4, then SpaceX would likely have to wait until it is solved to try again.", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space.com"}, "authors":

The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship.\n\nFlight 4 will fly a similar trajectory as the previous flight test, with Starship targeted to splashdown in the Indian Ocean, according to SpaceX. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_propellant_depot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbital propellant depot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payload"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Software", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Software", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 318, "textEnd": 324}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 367, "textEnd": 373}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Starship, meanwhile, blasted its own engines to begin its trek around the globe toward the Indian Ocean, a roughly 90-minute trip.\n\nThere, it will attempt to return to Earth and survive the intense heat of atmospheric re-entry - the crucial point at which it failed in March.\n\nThursday's mission is the latest trial in the test-to-failure rocket development campaign of Elon Musk's company.\n\nDesigned to be cheaper and more powerful than SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, Starship - standing nearly 400 feet (122 meters) tall - represents the future of the company's dominant satellite launch and astronaut business. It is due to be used by NASA in the next few years to land the first astronauts on the moon since 1972.\n\nEach Starship rocket has made it farther in its testing objectives than previous tests before failing, either by blowing up or disintegrating in the atmosphere.\n\nThe rocket's first launch in April 2023 exploded minutes after liftoff some 25 miles (40 km) above ground. During the next attempt in November, Starship reached space for the first time but exploded soon after.\n\nIn its most recent flight in March, Starship made it much farther and broke apart in Earth's atmosphere as it attempted to return from space halfway around the globe.\n\nThe rocket's flight on Thursday was a repeat of its previous test but with the aim to get farther.\n\nThe rocket is covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.\n\n\"The main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during reentry, ideally through max heating,\" Musk, CEO of SpaceX, wrote on social media on Saturday.\n\nMuch is riding on SpaceX's development of Starship, relied upon by NASA as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026 in a rivalry with China, which plans to send its astronauts there by 2030. China has made several recent advances in its lunar program, including a second landing on the moon's far side in a sample retrieval mission.\n\nDespite Starship's development appearing quicker than other rocket programs, it has been slower than Musk originally envisioned. A Japanese billionaire who initially paid to fly Starship around the moon canceled his flight last week, citing schedule uncertainties.\n\nAnd Musk's drive to rapidly build Starship has endangered SpaceX workers in Texas and California, a Reuters investigation found.\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

More than 2 million people followed along on a live stream on X. Starship is vital to both NASA's plans for returning astronauts to the Moon later this decade, and for SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's hopes of one day colonizing Mars. Three previous attempts have ended in its fiery destruction, all part of what the company says is an acceptable cost in its rapid trial-and-error approach to development.\n\n\"The payload for these flight tests is data,\" SpaceX posted on X. \"Building upon what we achieved during Starship's third flight test, our primary goal today is to get through the extreme heat of reentry.\"\n\nThe flight path is similar to the third test, which took place in March and saw Starship fly for 49 minutes before it was eventually lost as it re-entered the atmosphere. Since then SpaceX says it has made several software and hardware upgrades - and for the first time ever on Thursday succeeded in a soft splashdown for the Super Heavy booster in the Gulf of Mexico, to massive applause from engineers at mission control in Hawthorne in California. Next, it hopes to achieve its first \"controlled entry\" for the upper stage, which will glow a fiery red as it careens into the atmosphere at around 27,000 kilometers per hour.\n\nDesigned to eventually be fully reusable, Starship stands 121 meters tall with both stages combined. Its Super Heavy booster produces 74.3 meganewtons of thrust, about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rockets used during the Apollo missions - though later versions should be more powerful still.\n\nSpaceX's strategy of carrying out tests in the real world rather than in labs has paid off in the past. Its Falcon 9 rockets have come to be workhorses for NASA and the commercial sector, its Dragon capsule sends astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, and its Starlink internet satellite constellation now covers dozens of countries. But the clock is ticking for SpaceX to be ready for NASA's planned return of astronauts to the Moon in 2026, using a modified Starship as the final vehicle to take astronauts from orbit down to the surface.\n\nTo accomplish this, SpaceX will need to first place a primary Starship in orbit, then use multiple \"Starship tankers\" to fill it up with supercooled fuel for the onward journey - a complex engineering feat that has never before been accomplished.\n\nAt least one SpaceX fan has grown tired of waiting.

The company embraces these failures as part of its \"rapid spiral development\" approach, which involves quickly building and testing prototypes to accelerate progress.\n\nThe swift development of Starship is not only vital for SpaceX's ambitions but also for NASA's lunar program, which faces competition from China's own moon ambitions.\n\nStarship's success could solidify SpaceX's position as a leading provider of space transportation services and pave the way for future missions to Mars and beyond.\n\nAs SpaceX prepares for this pivotal test flight, the company and its engineers will be closely monitoring every aspect of the launch and reentry, gathering data to refine the design and overcome the challenges that have plagued previous attempts.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stage-to-orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-stage-to-orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outer space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artemis program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Falcon 9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/starship-super-heavy-054433479-16x9_0.jpeg?VersionId=ymW3WVFGreeASGfwhfYItRpx2lQyB8wh", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

This marks a significant milestone for the reusable rocket system, which has faced multiple failed attempts. The breakthrough enhances SpaceX's plans for satellite launches and moon missions.\n\nSpaceX's Starship rocket survived a fiery, hypersonic return from space and achieved a breakthrough landing demonstration in the Indian Ocean on Thursday, completing a full test mission around the globe on the rocket's fourth try. Starship's controlled plunge into the Indian Ocean just 65 minutes after launching from Texas capped the latest advance in the company's test-to-failure rocket development campaign, a multibillion-dollar effort by Elon Musk's space company to build a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander.\n\nThe three previous test missions ended with Starship blowing up or disintegrating. The two-stage, nearly 400-foot (120-meter) tall rocket system, consisting of the Starship vessel mounted atop its towering Super Heavy rocket booster, blasted off from the company's Starbase launch site near Boca Chica Village in South Texas, sending powerful shockwaves rippling through the Gulf Coast's morning fog.\n\nSuper Heavy detached from the Starship upper stage at an altitude of 74 km (46 miles), as Starship ignited its own engines to ascend further toward space. Meanwhile, Super Heavy returned to the Gulf of Mexico and nailed a soft splashdown, demonstrating a touchdown that would otherwise be on land. In space, a SpaceX live stream showed Starship, outfitted with onboard cameras, coasting around 16,000 miles (25,750 km)per hour at roughly 200 km (125 miles) in altitude as it made its way toward the Indian Ocean for a return to Earth, setting up for a key demonstration in its reusable design.\n\nThe rocket's first launch in April 2023 exploded minutes after liftoff some 25 miles (40 km) above ground, while its second attempt in November blew up after reaching space. The rocket's third test flight in March made it much farther but broke apart during atmospheric reentry some 64 km (40 miles) over the Indian Ocean. On Thursday, Starship appeared to have overcome those past technical challenges. Beginning at about 45 minutes into flight, onboard cameras showed a field of superhot plasma forming around Starship's exterior - marking with hues of orange, red, bluish purple, and green the start of the spaceship's blazing hot plunge through Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAs Starship's descent was slowed by violent atmospheric friction, bits of metal and its hexagonal heat-shield tiles began flying off and parts of the rocket's steering flaps were stripped to a skeleton, though they remained functional. Starship reignited an engine to flip itself upright in mid-descent, as it would for a landing on ground or on the moon, then splashed into the Indian Ocean, as confirmed by waves of water seen through an onboard camera's broken, debris-covered lens.\n\n'STARSHIP MADE IT ALL THE WAY' \"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who had said Starship's reentry was the mission's biggest goal, posted on social media after the splashdown.\n\nThe rocket was partly covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds. Designed to be cheaper and more powerful than SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, Starship represents the future of the company's dominant satellite launch and astronaut business.

The rocket system's first stage, called Super Heavy, is set to ignite its 33 Raptor engines to lift off, then separate from the Starship second stage, which would then blast further into space.\n\nSuper Heavy is expected to reignite some engines and return towards the Gulf of Mexico for a \"soft splashdown\" to simulate a landing that would otherwise be on land.\n\nMeanwhile in space, Starship is expected to trek around the globe heading for the Indian Ocean to make a second attempt to survive the intense heat of atmospheric re-entry -- the crucial point at which it failed in March.\n\nThe rocket is covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.\n\n\"The main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during re-entry, ideally through max heating,\" Musk, CEO of SpaceX, wrote on social media on Saturday.\n\nMuch is riding on SpaceX's development of Starship, relied upon by NASA as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026 in a rivalry with China, which plans to send its astronauts there by 2030. China has made several recent advances in its lunar program, including a second landing on the moon's far side in a sample retrieval mission.\n\nDespite Starship's development appearing quicker than other rocket programs, it has been slower than Musk originally envisioned. A Japanese billionaire who initially paid to fly Starship around the moon cancelled his flight last week, citing schedule uncertainties.\n\nAnd Musk's drive to rapidly build Starship has endangered SpaceX workers in Texas and California, a Reuters investigation found.", "source": {"uri": "timeslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times LIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stage-to-orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-stage-to-orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falcon 9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_speed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hypersonic speed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far side of the Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_swvRzyMLY3HBrR0f5BVkly8lT2lXIEpFtmWtA4AxfISkULPj4KG9GqJ2-xapZJmVyiwDuiIbwJu9Mmsw5JjClKN4EpK93Vq8Q=s1000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Working toward an ultimate goal of delivering astronauts back and forth between the Earth, moon and even Mars, SpaceX has called each previous test flight an improvement on the last.\n\nSpaceX provided live coverage of the launch on the SpaceX website and X, formerly Twitter, account. The company has been provided millions in funding from NASA in hopes of producing a commercial rocket that can safely take astronauts to the moon by 2026.\n\nSpaceX launch livestream: How to watch Starship's fourth test flight\n\nHere are updates from the launch and what to know about the previous test flights.\n\nStarship test launches: Here's what happened in first 3 SpaceX Starship test launches\n\nThe SpaceX Starship spacecraft lifted off from SpaceX's private Starbase site in Boca Chica, Texas at 8:50 a.m. E.T. on Thursday.\n\nThis time, 32 of 33 engines lit as the craft launched. Roughly three minutes into the flight, the ship successfully began traveling on its own without the assistance of the booster.\n\nAround 7 minutes and 30 seconds into the flight, the booster successfully re-entered Earth's atmosphere and splash down into the Indian Ocean.\n\nThis is the fourth such unmanned test launch of the Starship, which hopes to one day bring NASA astronauts to the moon and even as far as Mars.\n\n\"We're continuing to rapidly develop Starship, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as quickly as possible as we build a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and beyond,\" said the space company in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe successful launch is a positive sign for SpaceX and NASA, which awarded the company a $2.9 billion contract in 2021 to develop the first commercial human lander for its upcoming Artemis III mission to the moon slated for 2026.\n\nNASA agreed to pay Elon Musk's company the hefty sum in hopes SpaceX will develop a spacecraft able to transport astronauts to the moon's surface.\n\nNASA originally intended to launch this mission and its Artemis II astronauts into orbit by the end of the year on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon. The space agency then planned a moon landing for one year later, part of the Artemis III mission. However, the program missions have since been delayed by at least a year after NASA encountered a slew of issues.\n\nNASA intends to eventually send a crew to the moon's unexplored south-polar region in a mission that would be the first of its kind in American history since the Apollo program ended in 1972.\n\nSpaceX's Starship has had three previous test launches since April 2023. While all three ended in explosions, each one \"made tremendous strides\" toward the ultimate goal of developing rapidly reliable reusable rockets.\n\nStarship got off to a rough start when it exploded just four minutes into its inaugural test flight on April 20, 2023.\n\nThe craft launched from the Starbase site, but several of the craft's engines failed to ignite, triggering an explosion before the booster and spacecraft were able to separate. The rocket's flight termination system was activated to destroy the tumbling vehicle, which reached a total height of about 24 miles above the ground.\n\nThe second launch attempt on Nov. 18 2023 saw the craft survive longer and reach new milestones.\n\nThis time, the booster was able to successfully separate from the rocket, which reached space before the ground crew lost communication with it after nine minutes. Three minutes later, SpaceX lost both the booster and the spacecraft in two explosions.\n\nAll 33 booster engines fired as designed in this launch, and the ship reached an altitude of 92 miles.\n\nThe third test launch, which took place on March 14, saw Starship successfully separating from the booster and making it to orbit shortly after launch.\n\nA series of in-flight tests were conducted until Starship began to make its way back into the Earth's atmosphere, at which point signal to the craft was lost and about an hour into the mission and it was concluded the craft likely broke apart.\n\nSpaceX said this flight reached several more milestones, including the first reentry from space, first opening and closing of the craft/s payload door in space and a successful propellant transfer demonstration.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artemis 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_heavy-lift_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super heavy-lift launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artemis 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geocentric orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lander_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lander (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_news_641/fbec6fa61fe3ce8b8faee583b9d8945f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 4011, "textEnd": 4019}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-04-", "textStart": 3167, "textEnd": 3175}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-11-", "textStart": 3542, "textEnd": 3549}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

This will be a suborbital flight, meaning that it won't go around Earth. Instead, it aims to have a soft water landing in the Indian Ocean about an hour after liftoff from the launch site in Boca Chica, Texas.\n\nGetting Starship to work as it should isn't just a flight of fancy for SpaceX: It's a critical component for NASA's return to the moon.\n\nA variation of Starship, called the Human Landing System, will dock with the space agency's Orion spacecraft for the planned 2026 Artemis III mission, then shuttle a pair of astronauts to the lunar surface.\n\nStarship is made up of two stages: the first stage is the Super Heavy rocket, while the second stage is also referred to as Starship.\n\nJust as with SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, the first stage is meant to be reusable and return to Earth shortly after launching. The second stage would house cargo -- or astronauts in the case of the Human Landing System -- and also be fully reusable.\n\nSpaceX has met many of its goals in testing this behemoth. The first, in April 2023, was a test to see if it would be capable of lifting off the pad, and it did. However, it severely damaged the launch pad in doing so, and blew up four minutes into its flight.\n\nIn the second launch, in November 2023, SpaceX tested its \"hot staging\" where the rocket of the second stage ignites just before the pair separate. While that was successful, the first stage was lost in an explosion, and the second stage made it to suborbit before it, too, exploded.\n\nThe third launch, on March 14, was a test of several more components, including a boostback burn where the first stage uses 13 of its 33 engines to guide it to where it would land (in this case, it would make a water landing in the Gulf of Mexico). However, it had engine issues and failed to achieve a soft water landing.\n\nStarship also reached its full ascent and began to re-enter the atmosphere -- which was a test of the tiles that protect the spacecraft as it heats up during re-entry -- but an unplanned roll caused it to break up. It also opened and closed its payload bay door.\n\nPerhaps most importantly for NASA , it tested a propellant transfer within the rocket. For the Artemis missions to the moon, SpaceX will have to prove that it can do this between two ships. This was just the first step.\n\nWhile not everything went as planned in the last launch, SpaceX regarded it as a successful testing of crucial components. That's SpaceX's modus operandi: Test things in the real world.\n\n\"SpaceX is doing what SpaceX is good at, which is getting the flight test off and running, and learning from the flight test, taking what they learned and get it into the next one,\" said Dan Dumbacher, an engineer and former NASA official who is now the CEO of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\n\nFor this test, SpaceX's primary goals are to successfully conduct the landing burn of the Super Heavy booster, once again, aiming to softly splash down in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAs well, it hopes to achieve a successful re-entry of Starship, where it will splash down in the Indian Ocean.\n\nCanadian Jordan Bimm, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago and a space historian, says there's a lot riding on SpaceX's latest uncrewed test flight of Starship.\n\n\"So far, the public has accepted the iterative design approach, and have tolerated the failure-as-progress-toward-success model,\" he said. \"A failure to push further towards a complete, successful flight than previous tests could erode public acceptance and tolerance of the iterative approach.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca",

More than two million people followed along on a live stream on X.\n\nStarship is vital to both NASA's plans for returning astronauts to the Moon later this decade, and for SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's hopes of one day colonizing Mars.\n\nThree previous attempts have ended in its fiery destruction, all part of what the company says is an acceptable cost in its rapid trial-and-error approach to development.\n\n\"The payload for these flight tests is data,\" SpaceX posted on X. \"Building upon what we achieved during Starship's third flight test, our primary goal today is to get through the extreme heat of reentry.\"\n\nOnlookers watch as Starship is prepared for the test flight Alamy Alamy\n\nThe flight path is similar to the third test, which took place in March and saw Starship fly for 49 minutes before it was eventually lost as it re-entered the atmosphere.\n\nSince then SpaceX says it has made several software and hardware upgrades - and for the first time ever on today succeeded in a soft splashdown for the Super Heavy booster in the Gulf of Mexico, to massive applause from engineers at mission control in Hawthorne in California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext, it hopes to achieve its first \"controlled entry\" for the upper stage, which will glow a fiery red as it careens into the atmosphere at around 27,000 kilometers per hour (nearly 17,000 mph).\n\nTwice as powerful as Saturn V\n\nDesigned to eventually be fully reusable, Starship stands 121 metres tall with both stages combined - 27 metres taller than the Statue of Liberty.\n\nIts Super Heavy booster produces 16.7 million pounds of thrust, about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rockets used during the Apollo missions - though later versions should be more powerful still.\n\nSpaceX's strategy of carrying out tests in the real world rather than in labs has paid off in the past.\n\nIts Falcon 9 rockets have come to be workhorses for NASA and the commercial sector, its Dragon capsule sends astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, and its Starlink internet satellite constellation now covers dozens of countries.\n\nBut the clock is ticking for SpaceX to be ready for NASA's planned return of astronauts to the Moon in 2026, using a modified Starship as the final vehicle to take astronauts from orbit down to the surface.\n\nTo accomplish this, SpaceX will need to first place a primary Starship in orbit, then use multiple \"Starship tankers\" to fill it up with supercooled fuel for the onward journey - a complex engineering feat that has never before been accomplished.\n\nAt least one SpaceX fan has grown tired of waiting.

Meanwhile, Super Heavy returned to the Gulf of Mexico and nailed a soft splashdown, demonstrating a touchdown that would otherwise be on land.\n\nIn space, a SpaceX live stream showed Starship, outfitted with onboard cameras, coasting around 16,000 miles (25,750 km)per hour at roughly 200 km (125 miles) in altitude as it made its way toward the Indian Ocean for a return to Earth, setting up for a key demonstration in its reusable design.\n\nThe rocket's first launch in April 2023 exploded minutes after liftoff some 25 miles (40 km) above ground, while its second attempt in November blew up after reaching space. The rocket's third test flight in March made it much farther but broke apart during atmospheric reentry some 64 km (40 miles) over the Indian Ocean.\n\nOn Thursday, Starship appeared to have overcome those past technical challenges. Beginning at about 45 minutes into flight, onboard cameras showed a field of superhot plasma forming around Starship's exterior - marking with hues of orange, red, bluish purple, and green the start of the spaceship's blazing hot plunge through Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAs Starship's descent was slowed by violent atmospheric friction, bits of metal and its hexagonal heat-shield tiles began flying off and parts of the rocket's steering flaps were stripped to a skeleton, though they remained functional.\n\nStarship reignited an engine to flip itself upright in mid-descent, as it would for a landing on ground or on the moon, then splashed into the Indian Ocean, as confirmed by waves of water seen through an onboard camera's broken, debris-covered lens.\n\n'STARSHIP MADE IT ALL THE WAY'\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who had said Starship's reentry was the mission's biggest goal, posted on social media after the splashdown.\n\nThe rocket was partly covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.\n\nDesigned to be cheaper and more powerful than SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, Starship represents the future of the company's dominant satellite launch and astronaut business.

"SpaceX's Starship survives return to earth, landsStaff WritersReutersThu, 6 June 2024 10:42PM\n\nSpaceX's giant Starship rocket has survived re-entry through earth's atmosphere and splashed down in the Indian Ocean as planned during its fourth test mission after launching from south Texas.\n\nThe two-stage spacecraft, consisting of the Starship cruise vessel mounted atop its towering Super Heavy rocket booster, broke apart during its last attempt in March to survive a blazingly hot re-entry through earth's atmosphere.\n\nBut the craft survived its re-entry on Thursday, a SpaceX livestream showed.\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk posted on social media after the splashdown.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nStarship, stacked atop its Super Heavy booster, blasted off on Thursday morning from the company's Starbase launch site near Boca Chica Village on the Gulf Coast of Texas.\n\nIt is the latest trial mission in the test-to-failure rocket development campaign of Musk's company.\n\nThe rocket system's first stage, called Super Heavy, detached from the Starship upper stage three minutes into flight dozens of miles above ground, sending the Starship on its way toward space.\n\nSuper Heavy headed back toward land and appeared to achieve a soft landing in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nStarship, meanwhile, blasted its own engines to begin its trek around the globe toward the Indian Ocean, a roughly 70-minute trip.\n\nThere, it began its free-fall back to earth where it endured the intense heat of atmospheric re-entry - the crucial point at which it failed in March.\n\nDesigned to be cheaper and more powerful than SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, Starship - standing nearly 122 metres tall - represents the future of the company's dominant satellite launch and astronaut business.\n\nIt is due to be used by NASA in the next few years to land the first astronauts on the moon since 1972.\n\nEach Starship rocket has made it farther in its testing objectives than previous tests before failing, either by blowing up or disintegrating in the atmosphere.\n\nThe rocket's first launch in April 2023 exploded minutes after lift-off 40km above ground.\n\nDuring the next attempt in November, Starship reached space for the first time but exploded soon after.\n\nIn its most recent flight in March, Starship made it much farther and broke apart in earth's atmosphere as it attempted to return from space halfway around the globe.\n\nThe rocket's flight on Thursday was a repeat of its previous test but with the aim to get farther.\n\nThe rocket is covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.\n\n\"The main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during re-entry, ideally through max heating,\" Musk wrote on social media on Saturday.\n\nMuch is riding on SpaceX's development of Starship, relied upon by NASA as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026 in a rivalry with China, which plans to send its astronauts there by 2030.\n\nChina has made several recent advances in its lunar program, including a second landing on the moon's far side in a sample retrieval mission.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for

Meanwhile, Super Heavy returned to the Gulf of Mexico and nailed a soft splashdown, demonstrating a touchdown that would otherwise be on land.\n\nIn space, a SpaceX live stream showed Starship, outfitted with onboard cameras, coasting around 16,000 miles (25,750 km)per hour at roughly 200 km (125 miles) in altitude as it made its way toward the Indian Ocean for a return to Earth, setting up for a key demonstration in its reusable design.\n\nThe rocket's first launch in April 2023 exploded minutes after liftoff some 25 miles (40 km) above ground, while its second attempt in November blew up after reaching space. The rocket's third test flight in March made it much farther but broke apart during atmospheric reentry some 64 km (40 miles) over the Indian Ocean.\n\nOn Thursday, Starship appeared to have overcome those past technical challenges. Beginning at about 45 minutes into flight, onboard cameras showed a field of superhot plasma forming around Starship's exterior - marking with hues of orange, red, bluish purple, and green the start of the spaceship's blazing hot plunge through Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAs Starship's descent was slowed by violent atmospheric friction, bits of metal and its hexagonal heat-shield tiles began flying off and parts of the rocket's steering flaps were stripped to a skeleton, though they remained functional.\n\nStarship reignited an engine to flip itself upright in mid-descent, as it would for a landing on ground or on the moon, then splashed into the Indian Ocean, as confirmed by waves of water seen through an onboard camera's broken, debris-covered lens.\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who had said Starship's reentry was the mission's biggest goal, posted on social media after the splashdown.\n\nThe rocket was partly covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.\n\nDesigned to be cheaper and more powerful than SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, Starship represents the future of the company's dominant satellite launch and astronaut business.

A Japanese billionaire who in 2018 paid to fly Starship around the moon, at the time expected to occur last year, canceled his flight last week, citing schedule uncertainties.\n\nMusk's drive to rapidly build Starship has endangered SpaceX workers in Texas and California, a Reuters investigation found.\n\nMusk, who founded SpaceX in 2002, has said Starship must launch hundreds of times before it carries humans, suggesting it could be years before the rocket flies crews or lands astronauts on the lunar surface.\n\nSpaceX routinely flies astronauts to and from the International Space Station in low-Earth orbit for NASA using its Crew Dragon capsule, which launches atop the company's Falcon 9 rocket.

Standing 233 feet (71 meters) tall, the rocket and its 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines roared to life, raising Starship -- the largest rocket in history -- into the sky over the Gulf of Mexico from the test site, called Starbase.\n\n\"Today's test was the clearest success to date,\" says Abhi Tripathi, a former mission director at SpaceX and now an aerospace engineer at the Space Science Laboratory at UC Berkeley. \"It was amazing.\"\n\nAlthough one of the engines failed (Starship is designed with redundancy in mind in case of engine failures), the rocket's journey to space passed smoothly. This was the third time a Starship vehicle had reached space and the second time it had reached suborbit, the other being the last test flight, IFT-3, in March.\n\nStarship is composed of two parts, a lower section known as the Super Heavy booster and the upper section, Starship itself, which will one day house as many as 100 humans on trips to the moon and Mars. Three minutes into today's flight, at an altitude of about 48 miles (78 kilometers), the two sections separated as planned, with Super Heavy then beginning its journey back to Earth.\n\nOnce Starship is fully operational, the goal is for each Super Heavy booster (and Starship) to land back at the launch site, where they will be caught by giant \"chopsticks\" on the launch tower, ready for another flight. Before SpaceX is comfortable attempting this, however, it wants to prove Super Heavy can return to Earth safely. So one of the key goals of today's test was for the booster to descend toward the Gulf of Mexico, relight 13 of its engines, and gently splash down.\n\nThat test was passed flawlessly for the first time, with the booster splashing down seven and a half minutes into the mission. \"That booster landing on the ocean was phenomenal,\" says Laura Forczyk, a space consultant and founder of the George-based firm Astralytical. \"That gives us confidence that SpaceX can make Starship reusable.\"\n\nStarship's journey into space continued, with the vehicle making its way over the Atlantic Ocean, southern Africa, and toward the Indian Ocean, reaching a peak altitude of 132 miles -- half the orbital height of the International Space Station -- about 24 minutes into the flight.\n\nFrom here it then began its own journey back into Earth's atmosphere, in an attempt to also perform a vertical test landing on the ocean. This task is much harder for Starship, however; traveling at some 17,000 miles per hour, the vehicle must contend with temperatures of 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit (1,400 degrees Celsius) when it hits the atmosphere.\n\nThe bottom of the spacecraft is coated in heat tiles to displace this heat, but on Starship's last test flight in March the vehicle broke apart at an altitude of about 40 miles because of the intensity of reentry. This time SpaceX was hoping to make it all the way to the ocean, with two of the tiles also removed to see how the vehicle itself coped with the high temperatures.", "source": {"uri": "wired.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wired"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@wired.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Berkeley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Altitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/6661e6f62c67d471c4eb68bf/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/SpaceX-Starship-Launch-Science-AP24158584363842.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Scheduled for Thursday, June 6, this flight aims to demonstrate further advancements toward a fully reusable space transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has granted SpaceX a launch license for this critical test mission, stating that SpaceX has \"met all safety and other licensing requirements.\" The test flight is expected to lift off from SpaceX's private Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, during a 120-minute window that opens at 8 a.m. ET. Space enthusiasts can watch the event live on SpaceX's website, with streaming beginning approximately 30 minutes before liftoff.\n\nRead More: SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches another Starlink mission\n\nThe primary objectives of this fourth test flight include executing a landing burn and achieving a soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, along with a controlled re-entry of the Starship vehicle. SpaceX aims to return and reuse both the Starship and the Super Heavy booster, aligning with their long-term goal of developing a fully reusable space transportation system.\n\nIn preparation for this flight, SpaceX has implemented several hardware and software upgrades based on lessons learned from previous tests. The third test flight, conducted in March, achieved multiple milestones before breaking apart after re-entry. This flight provided valuable data that has informed the modifications for the upcoming test.\n\nThe FAA and SpaceX have agreed on a new approach to handle potential anomalies during the test flight. The FAA has approved three specific scenarios involving the Starship's entry that would not require a detailed investigation if the vehicle is lost. These scenarios include the failure of a thermal shield, some loss of control of the vehicle in mid-flight, and the failure of an engine during a landing burn. This agreement allows for a more streamlined process in the event of test-induced damage, ensuring that SpaceX can continue its rapid development pace.\n\nSpaceX's Starship program is crucial not only for the company's ambitions but also for NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon. Starship has been selected as the lander for the Artemis 3 mission, set to carry astronauts to the Moon's south pole in 2026. The success of Starship is also central to Elon Musk's vision of enabling human settlement on Mars.\n\nThe journey of Starship has been marked by both spectacular achievements and fiery failures. The first two test flights in 2023 ended in explosions, with the rockets failing to reach their intended landing sites. SpaceX, however, views these failures as integral to its development process, using them to rapidly iterate and improve the design.\n\nRead More: Musk's SpaceX is building spy satellite network for US intelligence agency\n\nThe nearly hour-long third test flight managed to reach space before breaking apart after re-entry.

It is due to be used by NASA in the next few years to land the first astronauts on the moon since 1972.\n\nEach Starship rocket has made it farther in its testing objectives than previous tests before failing, either by blowing up or disintegrating in the atmosphere.\n\nThe rocket's first launch in April 2023 exploded minutes after liftoff some 25 miles (40 km) above ground. During the next attempt in November, Starship reached space for the first time but exploded soon after.\n\nIn its most recent flight in March, Starship made it much farther and broke apart in Earth's atmosphere as it attempted to return from space halfway around the globe.\n\nThe rocket's flight on Thursday will be a repeat of its previous test but with the aim to get farther. The rocket system's first stage, called Super Heavy, is set to ignite its 33 Raptor engines to lift off, then separate from the Starship second stage, which would then blast further into space.\n\nSuper Heavy is expected to re-ignite some engines and return toward the Gulf of Mexico for a \"soft splash-down\" to simulate a landing that would otherwise be on land.\n\nMeanwhile in space, Starship is expected to trek around the globe heading for the Indian Ocean to make a second attempt to survive the intense heat of atmospheric re-entry - the crucial point at which it failed in March.\n\nThe rocket is covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.\n\n\"The main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during reentry, ideally through max heating,\" Musk, CEO of SpaceX, wrote on social media on Saturday.\n\nMuch is riding on SpaceX's development of Starship, relied upon by NASA as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026 in a rivalry with China, which plans to send its astronauts there by 2030. China has made several recent advances in its lunar program, including a second landing on the moon's far side in a sample retrieval mission.\n\nDespite Starship's development appearing quicker than other rocket programs, it has been slower than Musk originally envisioned.

The test flight was the rocket system's fourth, broadcast on the company's website and X, the social platform acquired by the company's billionaire founder Elon Musk.\n\n\"It's safe to say she's getting a little beat up, but that's to be expected on a test flight,\" said Kate Tice, SpaceX's quality systems engineering manager, during Starship's descent. \"We are still learning how to improve the ship for total survival and recovery of the high heat reentry.\"\n\nThe test comes a day after Boeing's new Starliner spaceship launched a pair of NASA astronauts into space for its first crewed test flight to the International Space Station. The legacy aerospace company's launch lagged four years behind the one for SpaceX's competing Crew Dragon capsule, perhaps giving the American public a newfound appreciation for SpaceX's engineering style and prowess.\n\nStarship's one-hour test showed leaps in progress, achieving numerous objectives despite the atmosphere battering the ship before landing. The company has faced criticism for its previous test failures. Its executives insist that building fast, breaking expensive things, and learning from mistakes are all part of SpaceX's philosophy -- in stark contrast with NASA's slower pace.\n\n\"Flight tests like today are the fastest possible route for us to dramatically improve Starship's capabilities. The Starship flying today has already seen a number of changes based on what we learned from flight test three in March, which was only two-and-a-half months ago,\" Tice said. \"Development moves really fast here at SpaceX.\"\n\nThe primary goals of Thursday's test were for the spacecraft to survive the maximum heat of reentering Earth's atmosphere and to practice maneuvers for recovering the Super Heavy booster. SpaceX has incorporated a procedure called hot-staging, which involves reigniting engines while the craft is still attached to a partially lit booster, then returning the booster for a splashdown.\n\nAbout nine minutes into flight, SpaceX teams erupted in whoops and applause as the booster successfully performed its operation, plopping into the Gulf of Mexico. It was the first time the booster had accomplished a soft water landing.\n\nStarship then coasted for about 40 minutes in space at an altitude of 130 miles above Earth before trying a controlled reentry. The craft successfully flipped and initiated the engine burn before landing in the Indian Ocean, according to SpaceX's data, though camera views cut in and out during the descent.\n\nA torrent of debris fell off the vehicle, as it appeared engulfed in flames, and the lens even cracked in the process. It's not clear yet how much of the ship was intact by the time it hit the water.\n\nOverall, the test demonstrated enormous improvement over the third flight on March 14, when the extreme heat caused by air friction destroyed the ship early in its path back to Earth.\n\nNASA will depend on Musk's rocket company to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface on a modified Starship for the Artemis III and IV moon missions under a $4.2 billion contract. To do that, SpaceX first has to master how to refuel its spaceship after it has already left the planet.\n\nThree months ago, SpaceX flight controllers oversaw the transfer of several tons of liquid oxygen between tanks inside Starship. The demonstration was a preliminary test for in-space propellant transfers. In a news release, the company said the March demo was \"successful,\" though it didn't elaborate on how much fuel it was able to move.\n\nTo make the rest of the quarter-million-mile journey to the moon, Starship would need to top off its tank. SpaceX plans to send up tanker versions of Starship into low-Earth orbit, establishing a space gas station of sorts. The passenger version of Starship would dock at a tanker to fill up.\n\nNASA seemed satisfied with the outcome of Starship's flight on Thursday.\n\n\"Congratulations @SpaceX on Starship's successful test flight this morning!\" said administrator Bill Nelson on X. \"We are another step closer to returning humanity to the Moon through #Artemis -- then looking onward to Mars.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the anomalies that occurred during the test. It will then identify any changes SpaceX must make before it can fly Starship again.", "source": {"uri": "mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Systems engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Software", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Software", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01ytJOVXTbVZo6rFkfH6uoH/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1717680031.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 3330, "textEnd": 3338}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Today's test was the fourth flight of the fully integrated Starship stack, and it was the first time that the booster completed its flight without any major anomalies. SpaceX plans to catch the booster with its launch tower, but before the firm can attempt this, it has to ensure that the rocket is not a threat to the tower.\n\nSpaceX's Starship Super Heavy is the world's largest rocket booster courtesy of its 33 Raptor engines. These enable it to generate close to two million pounds of thrust, and these engines have proven tricky throughout the life of the Starship program. During the third Starship flight earlier this year, the booster nearly made it to a soft splashdown but its engines failed to ignite at the last moment. This left the rocket unable to reduce its speed, and as a result, it crashed into the ocean.\n\nAfter lift off today, 32 out of the 33 Raptor engines performed nominally and shut down as expected at the point of stage separation. A set of engines then successfully re-lit for the boost back burn, which propels the rocket back to the launch site while the second stage starts its journey. The key portion of the test for the Super Heavy was the ignition of its engines for the land burn since this was the point of failure during the previous flight.\n\nThis time around, the booster's engines re lit and successfully managed to slow it down for a soft landing. SpaceX's Elon Musk confirmed a soft splashdown on X, as his firm overcame a major hurdle in the Starship program.\n\nAfter this, the focus on the test shifted on the second stage Starship. The second stage provided great visuals during the last test attempt, as SpaceX was able to broadcast its atmospheric reentry in real time. Starship's reentry was also another primary test objective for today's test. Successful reentry is crucial for Starship since SpaceX plans to reuse the second stage spacecraft. This rapid re usability is at the heart of Starship's planned missions to Mars since it will enable SpaceX to significantly reduce launch costs.\n\nStarship re entered the atmosphere close to the 45 minute mark after lift off. The ship uses thousands of heat shield tiles assembled to make a single shield, and ahead of today's test, SpaceX had deliberately removed two tiles from the ship to evaluate its re entry by placing sensors in the area. This time around, the ship's flaps were more controlled in their movement in order to make sure that it was stable for the all important flip maneuver for landing.\n\nMission controllers confirmed at close to the 48 minute mark that the ship's flaps were performing normally. Soon after this, the second stage, Starship, started to glow purple as it was completely engulfed by plasma. Following this, the ship entered the atmosphere and entered the region where it experienced the highest reentry temperatures.\n\nStarship maintained its reentry trajectory after it cleared this region and appeared to be performing nominally seven minutes after its atmospheric reentry. At the 55 minute mark, green sparks engulfed the vehicle while mission controllers confirmed that the trajectory continued to remain normal. However, at this point, the forward flap (one on top of the rocket) caught fire and pieces continued to fly off of it. This also cracked the camera on the second stage Starship, but despite the flap damage, Starship continued to descend to Earth.\n\nThe second stage Starship also passed the region of maximum dynamic pressure, which is the point during reentry at which it experiences the greatest stress. Even though the camera lens had cracked, the ship crossed Mach 2 as it was roughly 30 kilometers above the ocean surface. Despite the fin damage, Starship started and ended its landing burn, which marked the end of today's test flight.\n\nAhead of the test, SpaceX had explained that the \"primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship,\" and at the flight's conclusion, it appears that all these objectives were met.", "source": {"uri": "wccftech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wccftech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ramish_zafar@wccftech.com", "name": "Ramish Zafar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thrust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flap (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_q", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max q"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stress (mechanics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mach number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Testing_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Testing and Tools", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SPACEX-STARSHIP-SUPER-HEAVY-IFT-4-728x403.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Its booster separated and splashed down in the ocean, and the spacecraft then flew around the Earth and completed a landing burn as it fell towards the water.\n\nThe spacecraft lost many of the tiles that keep it safe from heat, and one of the flaps intended to control its descent was damaged, but SpaceX maintained control of the spacecraft right into the ocean.\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" Mr Musk wrote on Twitter. \"Congratulations SpaceX team on an epic achievement!!\"\n\nSpaceX's previous Starship tests have seen the spacecraft destroyed at various - and increasingly late - parts of the mission.\n\nThe company said that it would be launching its next Starship test mission \"soon\".\n\nIt was the fourth test flight for the spacecraft, which Nasa and Mr Musk hope will eventually fly humans to the Moon and Mars.\n\nFor all of these initial trips, however, the spacecraft has been empty. The almost 400-foot tall spacecraft took off above the Gulf of Mexico and then headed to the east.\n\nThe first-stage booster that carried it up into the air then separated from the spacecraft as planned.\n\n\"And we have splashdown!\" SpaceX launch commentator Kate Tice announced from Mission Control at company headquarters in California.\n\nIt was a critical milestone in the company's plan to eventually return Starship's Super Heavy booster to its launch site for reuse.\n\nStarship then carried on, soaring on a half-lap of the Earth before splashing down in the Indian Ocean.\n\nSpaceX suggested that splash down had gone as planned, with Starship successfully undertaking a landing burn that was intended to ease its drop into the water.\n\nA previous version of Starship had come close to a success in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it flew out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter of a mile above the Gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one left a crater in the pad at Boca Chica Beach and threw debris for thousands of feet.\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration signed off on Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable, which is why SpaceX wanted to control the booster's entry into the Gulf and the spacecraft's descent into the Indian Ocean - it is intended as practice for planned future landings. Nothing will be recovered from Thursday's flight.\n\nNasa has ordered a pair of Starships for two moon-landing missions by astronauts later this decade.

One of the 33 engines on its \"super heavy\" booster failed to light as expected, but the rocket still rumbled off the pad and made a smooth ascent to space.\n\nAfter the booster separated from Starship, it turned around and used its engines to land gently in the Gulf of Mexico. The soft landing marks a major milestone for SpaceX, which hopes to be able to rapidly reuse both Starship and its booster on future missions..\n\nSpaceX is continuing to broadcast the launch live on X. You can watch it below\n\nHere's what else you need to know about this latest test flight.\n\nStanding nearly 400 feet tall when stacked on top of its \"Super Heavy\" booster, Starship is larger than even the Saturn V rockets that carried the Apollo astronauts to the moon. The spaceship is also unique in that it uses stainless steel instead of light-weight metals like aluminum and titanium.\n\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk wants Starship to one day carry astronauts to Mars. NASA has also given the company billions to develop it into a lunar lander, as part of its Artemis program to return astronauts to the moon. Finally, Starship is expected to play a pivotal role in the expansion of SpaceX's Starlink satellite network, by allowing the company to launch large numbers of internet-capable satellites all at once.\n\nTo achieve those lofty goals, Starship has to first prove it can work as intended. Its stainless steel body is supposed to make it rugged and rapidly reusable, and that is key to its many missions. The rocket's Raptor engines must also be able to fire and relight at different points in the flight.\n\nStarship's first test launch in April of 2023 ended with the entire rocket exploding over the Gulf of Mexico. Its second test flight ended after the spacecraft triggered its self-destruct system before reaching orbit.\n\nBut by test flight three, Starliner was behaving more like an actual spacecraft. It successfully reached its expected orbit, and cruised part way around the world.\n\nBut there were still plenty of problems. A cargo door didn't appear to open properly. And the Starship tumbled as it began to re-enter earth's atmosphere. SpaceX believes clogged valves prevented the roll-control thrusters from working properly. The superheated gasses around the vehicle eventually caused it to disintegrate somewhere over the Indian Ocean.\n\nMeanwhile the super-heavy booster also had issues. Its engines failed to re-light properly as it reentered the atmosphere and fell back towards earth. It broke apart above the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSpaceX says that it has made several modifications to the Starship in preparation for its fourth launch. They've added extra roll-control thrusters to keep it from tumbling. They've also made modifications to help the super-heavy booster more reliably relight its engines.\n\nAssuming those upgrades work, all eyes will be on Starship's heat shield. Heat tiles have been seen falling off during earlier launches, and on X, Elon Musk admitted that even a single missing tile could cause the ship to burn up in the atmosphere.\n\nIf the heat shield can work, the spacecraft will make a controlled re-entry and attempt a soft landing in the Indian Ocean.\n\nBut the spacecraft is still very much experimental. On its website, SpaceX promises only \"An exciting landing!\"", "source": {"uri": "kgou.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGOU 106.3"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stainless steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artemis program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_lander", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lunar lander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saturn V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Titanium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31b43ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6879x3869+0+645/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F6879x5159%20430%200%2Fresize%2F6879x5159%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F02%2F5d%2F2c911f8847d880e1f31ef9eaf586%2Fap24157475469369.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

A live webcast will begin around 30 minutes before liftoff and will stream on X (formerly known as Twitter) and the SpaceX website.\n\nThe fourth flight test of Starship is targeted to launch Thursday, June 6, from Starbase in Texas. The 120-minute test window opens at 7:00 a.m. CT.\n\nA live webcast of the flight test will begin about 30 minutes before liftoff, which you can watch here and on X @SpaceX. The launch window will open as early as 7 a.m. CT. As is the case with all developmental testing, the schedule is dynamic and likely to change, so be sure to stay tuned to our X account for updates.\n\nIn the most recent attempt on March 14, SpaceX employees cheered and clapped with excitement, praising the journey as \"phenomenal\" as it entered space and continued its flight for more than 45 minutes before crumbling upon its return to Earth.\n\nAs the spacecraft neared its planned splashdown in the Indian Ocean, about an hour after its launch from a South Texas beach, the live video feed showed a vibrant glow around the spacecraft. SpaceX later confirmed that the spacecraft had caught fire and incinerated during re-entry before plummeting into the ocean.\n\nStill, that was the furthest Starship had traveled, and employees deemed it a success. The eventual goal is for the spacecraft to carry astronauts to the moon and further.\n\n\"Starship's third flight test made tremendous strides towards a future of rapidly reliable reusable rockets,\" the SpaceX website states. \"The test completed several exciting firsts, including the first Starship reentry from space, the first ever opening and the closing of Starship's payload door in space, and a successful propellant transfer demonstration.\"\n\nOther attempts were not as successful, however.\n\nSpaceX launched its first Starship test flight in April 2023, but the vehicle encountered issues only 24 miles above the Gulf of Mexico when leaking propellant caused a fire in the Super Heavy booster, according to a story in Florida Today. This caused SpaceX to lose communication and control of the vehicle, but the Autonomous Flight Safety System took over and it detonated in less than four minutes.\n\nIn November, the Starship took flight again, reaching space for the first time, according to the SpaceX website. However, it encountered issues with the liquid oxygen supply during the flight, resulting in the failure of one engine and causing the vehicle to ignite into flames.\n\nAccording to the SpaceX website, the failure was \"determined to be filter blockage where liquid oxygen is supplied to the engines, leading to a loss of inlet pressure in engine oxidizer pumps that eventually resulted in one engine failing in a way that resulted in the loss of the vehicle.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_propellant_depot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbital propellant depot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Range safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidizing_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxidizing agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payload"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquid oxygen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1142, "textEnd": 1148}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 1576, "textEnd": 1584}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Both the Super Heavy booster and its Ship appeared to make their water landings, sending spectators at SpaceX's mission control at Starbase into a frenzy of cheers.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\n\"This whole building was going absolutely insane,\" SpaceX spokesperson Dan Huot said during live commentary from the company's headquarters in Hawthorne, California. \"When we saw the booster hit the water, I mean, wow.\"\n\nElon Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO, was thrilled.\n\n\"Successful soft landing of the Starship Super Heavy rocket booster!\" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter) after splashdown.\n\nThe Starship Ship vehicle, meanwhile, appeared to nail its landing burn despite one of its flaps clearly suffering burn-through damage during descent. Live camera views showed the flap's heat shield burn away, covering the the camera with debris, then ultimately cracking the lens.\n\nStill, the camera came back despite several signal drops, proving each time that Starship was alive. At landing, the Ship appeared to flip as planned and execute its landing burn, SpaceX said.\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" Elon Musk wrote on X later. \"Congratulations SpaceX team on an epic achievement!!\n\nThe crowd, as you'd expect, went wild.\n\n\"It was so loud here,\" Kate Tice, SpaceX quality systems engineering senior manager, said during live commentary. \"I haven't heard the crowd get that loud, probably, since Flight One.\"\n\nTice, Huot and SpaceX's Jessie Anderson celebrated the Starship landing by toasting a marshmallow with a Starship-shaped lighter.\n\nStarship views the fully reusable Starship as a revolutionary advance in spaceflight, one that could make human settlement of the moon and Mars economically feasible at long last.\n\nIndeed, the vehicle was designed with Mars in mind: Its next-gen Raptor engines (33 for Super Heavy and six for Ship) burn liquid oxygen and liquid methane, both of which can be sourced on the Red Planet.\n\nThe moon will likely be Starship's first far-flung stop, however. NASA selected the craft as the first crewed lander for its Artemis program of moon exploration, which aims to establish a research base in the ice-rich south polar region by the end of the 2020s. The current architecture calls for Starship to land NASA astronauts on the moon for the first time in September 2026, on the Artemis 3 mission.\n\nStarship will need to ace many more test flights before it's ready for that landmark mission, but the stainless-steel spacecraft is off to a good start: It has made significant progress on each of its four liftoffs to date.\n\nStarship's two stages failed to separate on its debut flight, which occurred in April 2023. That mission ended with a controlled detonation of the tumbling vehicle just four minutes after liftoff. (And that liftoff blasted a crater beneath Starbase's orbital launch mount, impelling SpaceX to install a water-spewing metal plate as heat-wicking reinforcement.)\n\nFlight 2, in November 2023, achieved stage separation but still ended early; both Ship and Super Heavy had been reduced to swirling bits in Earth's atmosphere by eight minutes after launch.\n\nStarship made a big leap on Flight 3, which launched on March 14 of this year. Stage separation occurred on time, and Super Heavy made it to within 1,650 feet (500 meters) of the Gulf of Mexico's wavetops before breaking apart. Ship, meanwhile, achieved orbital velocity and flew for nearly 50 minutes, finally succumbing to intense frictional heating as it reentered our atmosphere after an uncontrollable roll due to loss of its reaction control system, SpaceX said.\n\nFlight 4 saw yet more improvement, as the Super Heavy made it safely down to the water while the Ship appeared to maintain roll control during flight.\n\nDuring launch, the Super Heavy booster appeared to fire 32 of its 33 Raptor engines during liftoff, with one engine clearly out in video and telemetry. When the Super Heavy fired its 13-engine landing burn, only 12 engines fired, but the booster still appeared to make its \"soft landing\" splashdown, SpaceX said.\n\nIf you missed today's liftoff, don't worry: There will probably be many more Starship launches in the near future. SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has said the company aims to launch six test flights of the megarocket in 2024, which would work out to four more liftoffs in the next six months.\n\nThe timeline is not entirely up to SpaceX, of course; regulators such as the Federal Aviation Administration have a say. But, true to its fast-moving ways, SpaceX has already been gearing up for the coming Starship launches.

One of the 33 engines on its \"super heavy\" booster failed seconds after liftoff , but the rocket still rumbled off the pad and made a smooth ascent to space.\n\nAfter the booster separated from Starship, it turned around and used its engines to land gently in the Gulf of Mexico. The soft landing marks a major milestone for SpaceX, which hopes to be able to rapidly reuse both Starship and its booster on future missions.\n\nThe Starship spent about an hour cruising at the edge of space, all-the-while broadcasting views via SpaceX's Starlink satellite network. As it began its re-entry, a camera showed a bright purple plasma forming around one of the flaps used to control Starship's orientation.\n\nThe flap appeared to partially melt off in the intense heat of the upper atmosphere. Debris clouded the camera monitoring the spacecraft, and the lens eventually appeared to crack.\n\nNevertheless, the mammoth craft appeared to stay under control as it descended through the atmosphere. It's battered flaps shifted and put it into a vertical position. Cheers erupted from SpaceX headquarters at Hawthorne, Calif. as the craft appeared to touch down in the ocean as expected.\n\n\"From South Texas to the other side of the earth: Starship is in the water,\" said SpaceX communications manager Dan Huot.\n\nHere's what else you need to know about this latest test flight.\n\nStanding nearly 400 feet tall when stacked on top of its \"Super Heavy\" booster, Starship is larger than even the Saturn V rockets that carried the Apollo astronauts to the moon. The spaceship is also unique in that it uses stainless steel instead of light-weight metals like aluminum and titanium.\n\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk wants Starship to one day carry astronauts to Mars. NASA has also given the company billions to develop it into a lunar lander, as part of its Artemis program to return astronauts to the moon. Finally, Starship is expected to play a pivotal role in the expansion of SpaceX's Starlink satellite network, by allowing the company to launch large numbers of internet-capable satellites all at once.\n\nTo achieve those lofty goals, Starship has to first prove it can work as intended. Its stainless steel body is supposed to make it rugged and rapidly reusable, and that is key to its many missions. The rocket's Raptor engines must also be able to fire and relight at different points in the flight.\n\nOutside observers say that the fact both the spacecraft and its booster appeared to return to earth in one piece is a major milestone. This latest test flight puts the Starship program \"over the hump\" towards actually flying payloads to orbit around the earth, says Jonathan McDowell, a researcher at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory who tracks spaceflight.\n\n\"It surpassed my expectations, it was amazing,\" said Laura Forczyk, the executive director of Astralytical, a space consulting firm.\n\nStarship's first test launch in April of 2023 ended with the entire rocket exploding over the Gulf of Mexico. Its second test flight ended after the spacecraft triggered its self-destruct system before reaching orbit.\n\nBut by test flight three, Starship was behaving more like an actual spacecraft. It successfully reached its expected orbit, and cruised part way around the world.\n\nThere were still plenty of problems. A cargo door didn't appear to open properly. And the Starship tumbled as it began to re-enter earth's atmosphere. SpaceX believes clogged valves prevented the roll-control thrusters from working properly. The superheated gasses around the vehicle eventually caused it to disintegrate somewhere over the Indian Ocean.\n\nMeanwhile the super-heavy booster also had issues. Its engines failed to re-light properly as it reentered the atmosphere and fell back towards earth. It broke apart above the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSpaceX made several modifications to the Starship in preparation for its fourth launch. Engineers added extra roll-control thrusters to keep it from tumbling. They also made modifications to help the super-heavy booster more reliably relight its engines.\n\nThe company also took care to make sure its heat shield remained in tact, minus a few tiles that were deliberately removed to test how the structure would respond to heating.\n\nThere were clear issues with the test, such as the failed engine, and the partial disintegration of at least one of Starship's fins.\n\nHowever, experts agreed that this fourth flight was a major milestone for the program. SpaceX collected valuable data that will further allow development of the system.\n\n\"It was not flawless,\" Forczyk says. \"But I don't think anyone believed it would be flawless.\"\n\nMcDowell says the Starship is probably still a few test flights from actually carrying cargo to orbit. Still he says, \"they've successfully demonstrated some of the most difficult bits.\"\n\n\"I think they're legitimately pretty happy with this flight,\" he says.\n\nAs the company's webcast drew to a close, SpaceX engineers Kate Tice and Jessica Anderson celebrated the landing by roasting marshmallows -- a nod to the searing heat of re-entry.\n\n\"Just like Starship, I like this toasty,\" Tice joked as she held her flaming treat. Then she promised: \"We've got s'more test flights coming to you soon!\"", "source": {"uri": "gpb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Georgia Public Broadcasting"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flap (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mammoth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stainless steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outer space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawthorne, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawthorne, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.gpb.org/sites/default/files/styles/three_two_702x468/public/npr_story_images/2024/06/06/%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%252F1c%252Ff4%252F418042ff40779edc7d5ee3400fd9%252Fstarship-launch.jpg?itok=tjUiDqq-", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

But Starship's splashdown is even more impressive. The rocket ship flew into space, briefly cruised above Earth, and screamed back through the atmosphere at about 17,000 mph, enduring ultra-heated plasma lashing it at temperatures up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAs it approached the Indian Ocean, Starship fired its engines in an effort to flip itself upright and slow itself down, practicing a controlled landing. It's not clear how soft the landing was, as the spaceship was clearly shredding pieces on the livestream and visibility became extremely poor as it approached the water.\n\nWhatever happened, the ship completed its mission by sinking into the ocean.\n\nBelieve it or not, cannon-balling into the sea is a big deal for Starship. Last time it attempted the feat, in March, it disintegrated mid-fall.\n\nNow Starship and its Super Heavy booster are one big step closer to fulfilling their revolutionary promise of being the first fully reusable rocket system capable of reaching orbit. If Starship can translate this ocean landing into a land landing, it could slash the cost of spaceflight tenfold.\n\nThen, of course, there are Elon Musk's Mars ambitions. Starship is the vehicle that's supposed to build his city on the red planet, with a population of 1 million people.\n\n\"No rocket before this has had the potential to extend life to another planet,\" Musk, who founded SpaceX in 2002 for this very purpose, said in a speech standing before Starship at the company's Texas facilities in April.\n\nThe giant launch system, standing taller than the Statue of Liberty, fired its Raptor engines and roared past its Texas launchpad on Thursday morning.\n\nThe launch wasn't perfect -- one engine failed to light. But the rocket still worked.\n\nJust like on its last flight in March, the rocket's Super Heavy booster separated from the Starship rocket-ship high above Earth, allowing the winged spacecraft to continue into space.\n\nThe booster fell back to Earth, practiced firing its engines to lower itself as if it were landing on solid ground, and splash-landed in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThat checked off SpaceX's first vehicle-return goal for the flight. Next was Starship itself.\n\nOn its last plummet back to Earth, in March, Starship fell out of communications. SpaceX eventually declared it \"lost,\" likely broken apart or blown up by the stress of reentering the atmosphere.\n\nBut on Thursday the rocket ship survived the fall, splashing into the ocean and completing its first full flight.\n\nIt wasn't unscathed, though. One of its flaps began to visibly rip off and shred mid-fall, and the camera offering the live view cracked.\n\nNo orbital launch system on Earth is fully reusable. SpaceX pioneered reusing the lower stage of a rocket -- its booster -- with the Falcon 9, the workhorse that takes NASA missions and Starlink satellites to orbit.\n\nStarship-Super Heavy is poised to be the first system to also reuse the upper stage -- the spaceship that enters orbit after the booster falls away.\n\nIndeed, a Starship prototype already proved that it could lower itself to a soft landing from a flight six miles above Texas, albeit after several explosive failed attempts. But returning from orbital heights to land in one piece is another feat.\n\nOn its next flight, SpaceX might attempt to catch the Super Heavy booster with giant \"chopsticks\" on its Texas launch tower.\n\n\"I think the odds of actually catching the booster with the tower, probably like 80% or 90% this year,\" Musk said in his April speech. \"Which is insane. Like actually, when we first talked about it, it sounded so batshit crazy.\"\n\nAs for Starship, the upper stage, it might not descend from space to an actual landing pad until next year, he said.\n\n\"We just need to be confident that we can get through the high heating portion of the reentry reliably, and then we will bring the ship back and we'll land on the tower as well,\" Musk said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statue of Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Undeveloped_or_Vacant", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Undeveloped or Vacant", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YrVflsXPMpfovkTIfH1IGg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business_insider_articles_888/3315244c193cdd8904c4f3b251061b5e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

More than two million people followed along on a live stream on X.\n\nStarship is vital to both NASA's plans for returning astronauts to the Moon later this decade, and for SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's hopes of one day colonizing Mars.\n\nThree previous attempts have ended in its fiery destruction, all part of what the company says is an acceptable cost in its rapid trial-and-error approach to development.\n\n\"The payload for these flight tests is data,\" SpaceX posted on X. \"Building upon what we achieved during Starship's third flight test, our primary goal today is to get through the extreme heat of reentry.\"\n\nThe flight path is similar to the third test, which took place in March and saw Starship fly for 49 minutes before it was eventually lost as it re-entered the atmosphere.\n\nSince then SpaceX says it has made several software and hardware upgrades -- and for the first time ever today succeeded in a soft splashdown for the Super Heavy booster in the Gulf of Mexico, to massive applause from engineers at mission control in Hawthorne in California.\n\nNext, it hopes to achieve its first \"controlled entry\" for the upper stage, which will glow a fiery red as it careens into the atmosphere at around 27,000 kilometres per hour.\n\nTwice as powerful as Saturn V\n\nDesigned to eventually be fully reusable, Starship stands 121 metres tall with both stages combined -- 27.4 metres taller than the Statue of Liberty.\n\nIts Super Heavy booster produces 74.3 Meganewtons of thrust, about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rockets used during the Apollo missions -- though later versions should be more powerful still.\n\nSpaceX's strategy of carrying out tests in the real world rather than in labs has paid off in the past.\n\nIts Falcon 9 rockets have come to be workhorses for NASA and the commercial sector, its Dragon capsule sends astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, and its Starlink internet satellite constellation now covers dozens of countries.\n\nBut the clock is ticking for SpaceX to be ready for NASA's planned return of astronauts to the Moon in 2026, using a modified Starship as the final vehicle to take astronauts from orbit down to the surface.\n\nTo accomplish this, SpaceX will need to first place a primary Starship in orbit, then use multiple \"Starship tankers\" to fill it up with supercooled fuel for the onward journey -- a complex engineering feat that has never before been accomplished.\n\nAt least one SpaceX fan has grown tired of waiting. Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa announced this week he has canceled a planned trip around the Moon on Starship with a crew of artists, because he has no idea when it might actually happen. - AFP", "source": {"uri": "theborneopost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Borneo Post Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Payload"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_control_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mission control center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saturn V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawthorne, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawthorne, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusaku_Maezawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yusaku Maezawa"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2024/06/000_34VN7MK.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 12, "textEnd": 18}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The launch took place from the Starbase spaceport in Boca Chica, Texas, at 2:50 pm Swiss time. Separation of the spacecraft from the rocket stage also succeeded as planned. The super-heavy rocket landed a short time later in the Gulf of Mexico in a so-called fall, where the rocket stopped above the water and then fell into the water as planned.\n\nThe spacecraft is supposed to pass its test after about half an hour and return to Earth's atmosphere. Signal to the spaceship was temporarily lost, and the spacecraft reappeared on screens about 38 minutes into the flight time.\n\nThe first three test flights ended with the loss of the 120-meter rocket. According to SpaceX, valuable data was collected during the tests. \"For the fourth flight, we are shifting our focus from getting to orbit to demonstrating the ability to return\" and \"reuse\" the Starship rocket, SpaceX said.\n\nThe Starship missile system consists of a 70-meter-high first propulsion stage called Super Heavy and a 50-meter-long space shuttle called Starship with additional engines. With Starship, SpaceX aims to build a fully reusable rocket for challenging space missions.\n\nDuring its first test flight in April 2023, the Starship rocket stumbled and flew into the air. In the second attempt in November 2023, the missile exploded after a successful launch after separating from the propulsion stage. The third test flight took place in mid-March. The rocket traveled much further than it did on its first two test flights before SpaceX declared it \"lost\" 49 minutes after launch.\n\nSince then, SpaceX says it has made several changes to the rocket's hardware and software. The private space company's strategy of conducting tests under real conditions using prototypes rather than laboratory tests has proven successful in the past. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets are now regularly used on NASA missions and in commercial spaceflight.\n\nHowever, SpaceX is under time pressure with the spacecraft. In 2026, NASA wants to bring astronauts to the Moon for the first time in more than 50 years using a properly adapted spacecraft.

The three previous flight demos ended in explosions. This time, the rocket and the spacecraft managed to splash down in a controlled fashion, making the hourlong flight the longest and most successful yet.\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said via X.\n\nStarship was empty as it soared above the Gulf of Mexico and headed east on a flight to the Indian Ocean. Within minutes, the first-stage booster separated from the spacecraft and splashed into the gulf precisely as planned, after firing its engines.\n\nThe spacecraft reached an altitude of nearly 130 miles (211 kilometers), traveling at more 16,000 mph (26,000 kph), before beginning its descent. Live views showed parts of the spacecraft breaking away during the intense heat of reentry, but a cracked camera lens obscured the images.\n\nThe spacecraft remained intact enough to transmit data all the way to its targeted splashdown site in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt was a critical milestone in the company's plan to eventually reuse the rocket that NASA and Musk are counting on to get humanity to the moon and then Mars.\n\n\"What a show it has been,\" SpaceX launch commentator Kate Tice said from Mission Control at company headquarters in California.\n\nSpaceX came close to avoiding explosions in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (meters).\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable. That's why SpaceX wants to control the booster's entry into the gulf and the spacecraft's descent into the Indian Ocean -- it's intended as practice for planned future landings. Nothing is being recovered from Thursday's flight.\n\nNASA has ordered a pair of Starships for two moon-landing missions by astronauts, on tap for later this decade. Each moon crew will rely on NASA's own rocket and capsule to leave Earth, but meet up with Starship in lunar orbit for the ride down to the surface.\n\nSpaceX already is selling tourist trips around the moon. The first private lunar customer, a Japanese tycoon, pulled out of the trip with his entourage last week, citing the oft-delayed schedule.\n\nSpaceX's founder and CEO has grander plans: Musk envisions fleets of Starships launching people and the infrastructure necessary to build a city on Mars.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

The official SpaceX live stream will only be available on X.\n\nToday's launch will see the 122-meter-tall Starship rocket, consisting of the Super Heavy 11 booster and the Ship 29 upper stage, complete its most ambitious test flight to date. The first three missions, which took place in April and November 2023 and March 2024, provided essential data, but also resulting in explosions or dramatic ruptures during atmospheric re-entry.\n\nFor this fourth Starship test, SpaceX will focus on achieving the first soft landings of the rocket's two stages. The Super Heavy booster aims for a landing zone in the Gulf of Mexico near the Texas coast, while the Starship spacecraft aims for a controlled landing in the ocean after re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.\n\nWhatever happens, we will see the rocket crash into the sea. The success of this mission, however, would constitute a major step forward towards the total reuse of Starship, a capability essential, according to SpaceX, to the establishment of a sustainable human presence on the Moon and, ultimately, to the transport of people to Mars .\n\n\" The main objective of this mission is to penetrate much deeper into the atmosphere during re-entry, ideally with maximum heating \"said Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, on X.\n\nOf course, the chances of everything going perfectly during such an ambitious test are low.

In total, they make up a rocket that is 122 meters (400 feet) tall. NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which will be used to take astronauts back to the Moon, is 98 meters (322 feet) tall. For historical comparison, Super Heavy has twice the thrust of the Saturn V, which took the astronauts of the Apollo missions to the Moon. In the future, SpaceX hopes to increase the thrust by up to three times what was achieved by Saturn V.\n\nSLS was briefly the record holder of tallest and most powerful rocket ever built. But if there is a competition, it is friendly. SLS and Starship have to work together to return astronauts to the Moon. SLS will bring the Orion capsule to Lunar orbit - a special one called the Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit - where it will encounter Starship. Starship then will ferry the astronauts to and from the Moon's surface.\n\nWithout Starship, there is currently no way of getting to the lunar surface, hence the importance of these tests for the future of lunar exploration. Starship needs to demonstrate continuous safety and success. Two more tests are expected this year but SpaceX has not yet shared any details about them.\n\nStarship has so far achieved several successes but all its flights have ended in fire. The first launch in April 2023 showed that the rocket can fly but Super Heavy and Starship couldn't separate which led to SpaceX deliberately blowing up the rocket to keep it from veering off course.\n\nThere was a lot of discussion about the first test being rushed at the behest of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who was claimed to be keen to make a weed-related joke about the launch date as it lifted off on 4/20. Another point of evidence of the rush job of the launch was the extensive damage the rocket did to Starbase - its launch platform. Its powerful engine ended up blowing out a chunk of concrete from beneath its orbital launch mount and raining debris in the vicinity.\n\nThe second test was in November 2023. It was another partial success, building on the first launch. The Super Heavy booster exploded, but luckily after it had separated from Starship. But Starship too ended up going boom. Contact was lost between Starship and ground control after 9 minutes and the onboard computers exploded the ship.\n\nThe third test was the closest to a complete success. It took place in March and was the farthest and fastest that Starship has ever flown. Both Super Heavy and Starship were supposed to do a soft splash landing, but neither did. Super Heavy hit the Gulf of Mexico as fast as a F1 car. Starship burned over the Indian Ocean instead of splashing down in it.", "source": {"uri": "iflscience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFLScience"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space Launch System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terminal velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saturn V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thrust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Altitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orion (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lunar orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Test_and_Measurement", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Test and Measurement", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/74556/aImg/76674/starship-meta.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Mission duration, from start to finish: one hour and five minutes.\n\nThe 39-story-tall Super Heavy-Starship rocket is by far the most powerful launcher in the world with more than twice the liftoff thrust of the space shuttle, NASA's legendary Apollo program Saturn 5 and the Space Launch System rocket designed for the agency's Artemis moon rocket.\n\nPowered by 33 methane-burning Raptor engines, the 230-foot-tall Super Heavy booster generates a staggering 16 million pounds of thrust. It is designed to propel the Starship upper stage out of the lower atmosphere before falling away for a rocket-powered descent to landing, refurbishment and reuse.\n\nThe 160-foot-tall Starship, powered by six Raptors, also is designed to be fully reusable, capable of tail-first landings back on Earth, on the moon or even Mars.\n\nFor the Super Heavy-Starship's initial test flights, however, recovery was not an option. The goal was to \"simply\" get both stages back to the lower atmosphere intact and under control. For Thursday's flight, both stages were programmed to attempt rocket-powered descents mimicking actual landing procedures. But both were expected to sink on impact.\n\n\"The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship.\"\n\nDuring three previous flights, two in 2023 and the most recent in March, the Super Heavy and Starship stages suffered catastrophic failures before all the test objectives could be met. But with each flight, SpaceX implemented hardware and software upgrades that resulted in dramatically improved performance.\n\nIn third test flight, the Starship upper stage made it into space, looped around the planet and began a planned descent over the Indian Ocean before breaking up in the upper atmosphere. The Super Heavy booster made it back into the lower atmosphere over the Gulf of Mexico before control was lost.\n\nBut SpaceX hailed the flight as an overall success and made more changes to improve performance during Thursday's test.\n\nGetting the Super Heavy-Starship flying on a regular basis is critical to NASA's Artemis moon program. NASA awarded SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract in 2021 to develop a variant of the Starship upper stage to carry astronauts from lunar orbit down to the surface and back. Artemis crews will travel to and from the moon using Lockheed Martin-built Orion capsules.\n\nTo reach the moon, multiple Super Heavy tanker flights will have to be launched to robotically refuel a Starship upper stage already in low-Earth orbit. The Starship lander then will fly itself to lunar orbit to await the Artemis moonwalkers.\n\nNASA's contract requires one unpiloted lunar landing test flight before astronauts will make an actual landing attempt. Artemis managers are targeting late 2026 for the first lunar landing with astronauts on board.\n\nBut that will depend on SpaceX launching enough Super Heavy-Starship flights to demonstrate reliability. While SpaceX's philosophy is to fly frequently, learn from mistakes and fly again, NASA will require a long string of successful flights before the agency will deem it safe to put astronauts aboard.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thrust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Launch System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saturn V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artemis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Corporation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/06/4ba421c2-d612-4ebd-b6b7-d5ce1e432ff4/thumbnail/1200x630/1cc8ae132afe55077e32f335a8224398/060624-starship1.jpg?v=6d480a252670b63de1e37fef02c977a5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The three previous flight demos ended in explosions. This time, the rocket and the spacecraft managed to splash down in a controlled fashion, making the hourlong flight the longest and most successful yet.\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said via X.\n\nStarship was empty as it soared above the Gulf of Mexico and headed east on a flight to the Indian Ocean. Within minutes, the first-stage booster separated from the spacecraft and splashed into the gulf precisely as planned, after firing its engines.\n\nThe spacecraft reached an altitude of nearly 130 miles (211 kilometers), traveling at more 16,000 mph (26,000 kph), before beginning its descent. Live views showed parts of the spacecraft breaking away during the intense heat of reentry, but a cracked camera lens obscured the images.\n\nThe spacecraft remained intact enough to transmit data all the way to its targeted splashdown site in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt was a critical milestone in the company's plan to eventually reuse the rocket that NASA and Musk are counting on to get humanity to the moon and then Mars.\n\n\"What a show it has been,\" SpaceX launch commentator Kate Tice said from Mission Control at company headquarters in California.\n\nSpaceX came close to avoiding explosions in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (meters).\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable. That's why SpaceX wants to control the booster's entry into the gulf and the spacecraft's descent into the Indian Ocean -- it's intended as practice for planned future landings. Nothing is being recovered from Thursday's flight.\n\nNASA has ordered a pair of Starships for two moon-landing missions by astronauts, on tap for later this decade. Each moon crew will rely on NASA's own rocket and capsule to leave Earth, but meet up with Starship in lunar orbit for the ride down to the surface.\n\nSpaceX already is selling tourist trips around the moon.

But Starship's splashdown was even more impressive. The rocket ship flew into space, briefly cruised above Earth, and screamed back through the atmosphere at about 17,000 mph, enduring plasma lashing it at temperatures of up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAs it approached the Indian Ocean, Starship fired its engines in an effort to flip itself upright and slow itself down, practicing a controlled landing. It's not clear how soft the landing was, as the spaceship was clearly shredding pieces on the livestream and visibility became poor as it approached the water.\n\nWhatever happened, the ship completed its mission by sinking into the ocean.\n\nBelieve it or not, cannonballing into the sea is a big deal for Starship. Last time it attempted the feat, in March, it disintegrated midfall.\n\nNow Starship and its Super Heavy booster are one big step closer to fulfilling their revolutionary promise of being the first fully reusable rocket system capable of reaching orbit. If Starship can translate this ocean landing into a land landing, it could slash the cost of spaceflight significantly.\n\nThen, of course, there are Elon Musk's Mars ambitions. Starship is the vehicle that's supposed to build his city on the red planet, with a population of 1 million people.\n\n\"No rocket before this has had the potential to extend life to another planet,\" Musk, who founded SpaceX in 2002 for this very purpose, said in April, standing before Starship at the company's Texas facilities.\n\nStarship's 4th flight to space\n\nThe giant launch system, standing taller than the Statue of Liberty, fired its Raptor engines and roared past its launchpad in Texas on Thursday morning.\n\nThe launch wasn't perfect -- one engine failed to light. But the rocket still worked.\n\nJust as it did on its flight in March, the rocket's Super Heavy booster separated from the Starship rocket ship high above Earth, allowing the winged spacecraft to continue into space.\n\nThe booster fell back to Earth, practiced firing its engines to lower itself as if it were landing on solid ground, and splash-landed in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThat checked off SpaceX's first vehicle-return goal for the flight. Next was Starship itself.\n\nOn its plummet back to Earth in March, Starship fell out of communications. SpaceX eventually declared it lost, likely broken apart or blown up by the stress of reentering the atmosphere.\n\nBut on Thursday the rocket ship survived the fall, splashing into the ocean and completing its first full flight.\n\nIt wasn't unscathed, though. One of its flaps began to rip off and shred midfall, and the camera offering the live view cracked.\n\nNext step: catch the rocket with 'chopsticks'\n\nNo orbital launch system on Earth is fully reusable. SpaceX pioneered reusing the lower stage of a rocket -- its booster -- with the Falcon 9, the workhorse that takes NASA missions and Starlink satellites to orbit.\n\nStarship-Super Heavy is poised to be the first system to also reuse the upper stage: the spaceship that enters orbit after the booster falls away.\n\nA Starship prototype already proved that it could lower itself to a soft landing from a flight 6 miles above Texas, albeit after several explosive failed attempts. But returning from orbital heights to land in one piece is another feat.\n\nOn its next flight, SpaceX might attempt to catch the Super Heavy booster with giant \"chopsticks\" on its Texas launch tower.\n\n\"I think the odds of actually catching the booster with the tower, probably like 80% or 90% this year,\" Musk said in April. \"Which is insane. Like actually, when we first talked about it, it sounded so batshit crazy.\"\n\nAs for Starship, the upper stage, it might not descend from space to an actual landing pad until next year, he said.\n\n\"We just need to be confident that we can get through the high heating portion of the reentry reliably, and then we will bring the ship back and we'll land on the tower as well,\" Musk said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "morgan_mcfall_johnsen@yahoo.com", "name": "Morgan McFall-Johnsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statue of Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Undeveloped_or_Vacant", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Undeveloped or Vacant", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XjXj.SWduIoTKkw.KBQScA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business_insider_articles_888/3315244c193cdd8904c4f3b251061b5e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The mega rocket will lift off from SpaceX's Starbase launch site in Texas when the 120-minute launch window opens at 5:30 pm IST.\n\nSpaceX has secured a launch approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) which oversees the aviation sector in the US and if the companies are fulfilling the safety requirements.\n\n\"The FAA has approved a license authorization for SpaceX Starship Flight 4. SpaceX met all safety and other licensing requirements for this test flight,\" the FAA said in its statement.\n\nStarship previously flew on March 14 and that was its most successful flight out of the last three. While the rocket will follow a trajectory similar to flight 3, there are a few changes that have been revealed for flight 4.\n\nALSO SEE: Rocket Bonanza! Starship And Starliner May Launch Hours Apart In Early June\n\nHow is flight 4 different from flight 3?\n\nIn terms of trajectory, both the missions are the same. Starship will lift off from Texas, the Super Heavy Booster will separate from the upper stage and fall into the Gulf of Mexico, and the upper stage will reach space before a splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nBut for flight 4, SpaceX has proposed three scenarios concerning Starship's re-entry. The re-entry is something SpaceX will look to master in the next mission.\n\nAccording to the FAA, it has approved 'Test Induced Damage Exception' for scenarios associated with certain flight events and components of Starship, Ars Technica's Eric Berger reported on X.\n\nAn investigation will not be required into Starship if there is a failure of the thermal shield due to overheating during re-entry, if the flap system of Starship's upper stage is unable to provide sufficient control under high pressure and if the failure of an engine during the 'landing' burn.'\n\n\"If one of these scenarios occurs, an investigation will not be required provided there was no serious injury of fatality, no damage to unrelated property and no debris outside designated hazard areas,\" the FAA said.\n\nALSO SEE: Actor Dev Joshi's Week-Long Trip Around The Moon On Starship Cancelled\n\nThe last three flights of Starship have been subject to investigation because SpaceX lost the vehicle in explosions before the missions ended. The decision of forgoing scrutiny after flight 4 could allow SpaceX to launch the fifth mission in a shorter time.\n\nOn the technical front, SpaceX will also not attempt restarting the upper stage's raptor engines while in space. This was already successfully tested in the last mission. Also, the upper stage Starship doesn't have a payload door whose opening and closing was tested in flight 3.\n\nIn its mission overview, SpaceX said that the primary objectives will be \"executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship.\"\n\n(Image: X/@ElonMusk)", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbital spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Berger_(meteorologist)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Berger (meteorologist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Technica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ars Technica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payload"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flap (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/seo/7/74083/74083_pj38.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 53, "textEnd": 59}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 597, "textEnd": 605}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

This time, the rocket and the spacecraft managed to splash down in a controlled fashion, making the hour-long flight the longest and most successful yet.\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said via X.\n\nLaunching from Texas, the test Starship was empty as it soared above the Gulf of Mexico and headed east on a flight to the Indian Ocean.\n\nWithin minutes, the first-stage booster separated from the spacecraft and splashed into the gulf precisely as planned, after firing its engines.\n\nThe spacecraft reached an altitude of nearly 211 km, traveling at more 26,000 kph/h, before beginning its descent.\n\nLive views showed parts of the spacecraft breaking away during the intense heat of reentry, but a cracked camera lens obscured the images.\n\nThe spacecraft remained intact enough to transmit data to its targeted splashdown site in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt was a critical milestone in the company's plan to eventually reuse the rocket that NASA and Musk are counting on to get humanity to the Moon and then to Mars.\n\n\"What a show it has been,\" SpaceX launch commentator Kate Tice said from Mission Control at company headquarters in California.\n\nSpaceX came close to avoiding explosions in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border.

Both the Super Heavy booster and its Ship appeared to make their water landings, sending spectators at SpaceX's mission control at Starbase into a frenzy of cheers.\n\n\"This whole building was going absolutely insane,\" SpaceX spokesperson Dan Huot said during live commentary from the company's headquarters in Hawthorne, California. \"When we saw the booster hit the water, I mean, wow.\"\n\nElon Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO, was thrilled.\n\n\"Successful soft landing of the Starship Super Heavy rocket booster!\" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter) after splashdown.\n\nThe Starship Ship vehicle, meanwhile, appeared to nail its landing burn despite one of its flaps clearly suffering burn-through damage during descent. Live camera views showed the flap's heat shield burn away, covering the the camera with debris, then ultimately cracking the lens.\n\nStill, the camera came back despite several signal drops, proving each time that Starship was alive. At landing, the Ship appeared to flip as planned and execute its landing burn, SpaceX said.\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" Elon Musk wrote on X later. \"Congratulations SpaceX team on an epic achievement!!\n\nThe crowd, as you'd expect, went wild.\n\n\"It was so loud here,\" Kate Tice, SpaceX quality systems engineering senior manager, said during live commentary. \"I haven't heard the crowd get that loud, probably, since Flight One.\"\n\nTice, Huot and SpaceX's Jessie Anderson celebrated the Starship landing by toasting a marshmallow with a Starship-shaped lighter.\n\nRelated: Relive SpaceX Starship's 3rd flight test in breathtaking photos\n\nStarship views the fully reusable Starship as a revolutionary advance in spaceflight, one that could make human settlement of the moon and Mars economically feasible at long last.\n\nIndeed, the vehicle was designed with Mars in mind: Its next-gen Raptor engines (33 for Super Heavy and six for Ship) burn liquid oxygen and liquid methane, both of which can be sourced on the Red Planet.\n\nThe moon will likely be Starship's first far-flung stop, however. NASA selected the craft as the first crewed lander for its Artemis program of moon exploration, which aims to establish a research base in the ice-rich south polar region by the end of the 2020s. The current architecture calls for Starship to land NASA astronauts on the moon for the first time in September 2026, on the Artemis 3 mission.\n\nStarship will need to ace many more test flights before it's ready for that landmark mission, but the stainless-steel spacecraft is off to a good start: It has made significant progress on each of its four liftoffs to date.\n\nStarship's two stages failed to separate on its debut flight, which occurred in April 2023. That mission ended with a controlled detonation of the tumbling vehicle just four minutes after liftoff. (And that liftoff blasted a crater beneath Starbase's orbital launch mount, impelling SpaceX to install a water-spewing metal plate as heat-wicking reinforcement.)\n\nFlight 2, in November 2023, achieved stage separation but still ended early; both Ship and Super Heavy had been reduced to swirling bits in Earth's atmosphere by eight minutes after launch.\n\nStarship made a big leap on Flight 3, which launched on March 14 of this year. Stage separation occurred on time, and Super Heavy made it to within 1,650 feet (500 meters) of the Gulf of Mexico's wavetops before breaking apart. Ship, meanwhile, achieved orbital velocity and flew for nearly 50 minutes, finally succumbing to intense frictional heating as it reentered our atmosphere after an uncontrollable roll due to loss of its reaction control system, SpaceX said.\n\nFlight 4 saw yet more improvement, as the Super Heavy made it safely down to the water while the Ship appeared to maintain roll control during flight.\n\nDuring launch, the Super Heavy booster appeared to fire 32 of its 33 Raptor engines during liftoff, with one engine clearly out in video and telemetry. When the Super Heavy fired its 13-engine landing burn, only 12 engines fired, but the booster still appeared to make its \"soft landing\" splashdown, SpaceX said.\n\nIf you missed today's liftoff, don't worry: There will probably be many more Starship launches in the near future. SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has said the company aims to launch six test flights of the megarocket in 2024, which would work out to four more liftoffs in the next six months.\n\nThe timeline is not entirely up to SpaceX, of course; regulators such as the Federal Aviation Administration have a say. But, true to its fast-moving ways, SpaceX has already been gearing up for the coming Starship launches. It test-fired the Flight 5 vehicle early last month, for example.", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_wall@space.com", "name": "Mike Wall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flap (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_landing_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soft landing (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_control_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mission control center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawthorne, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawthorne, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artemis program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_south_pole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lunar south pole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat shield"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Undeveloped_or_Vacant", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Undeveloped or Vacant", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hSYo26T6gc25sVZaJZsXPA-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 224, "textEnd": 230}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 3948, "textEnd": 3956}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Ground teams whooped and hollered as the upper stage glowed a fiery red during its descent, in footage relayed by SpaceX's Starlink satellite network.\n\nA piece of flying debris even cracked the camera lens, but the ship ultimately stuck the landing.\n\n\"Congratulations SpaceX on Starship's successful test flight this morning!\" NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on X. \"We are another step closer to returning humanity to the moon through #Artemis -- then looking onward to Mars.\"\n\nDesigned to eventually be fully reusable, Starship stands 397 feet (121 meters) tall with both stages combined -- 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty.\n\nIts Super Heavy booster produces 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rockets used during the Apollo missions -- though later versions should be more powerful still.\n\nSpaceX's strategy of carrying out tests in the real world rather than in labs has paid off in the past.\n\nIts Falcon 9 rockets have come to be workhorses for NASA and the commercial sector, its Dragon capsule sends astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, and its Starlink internet satellite constellation now covers dozens of countries.\n\nBut the clock is ticking for SpaceX to be ready for NASA's planned return of astronauts to the moon in 2026, using a modified Starship as the final vehicle to take astronauts from orbit down to the surface.\n\nTo accomplish this, SpaceX will need to first place a primary Starship in orbit, then use multiple \"Starship tankers\" to fill it up with supercooled fuel for the onward journey -- a complex engineering feat that has never before been accomplished.\n\nAt least one SpaceX fan has grown tired of waiting.

During the next attempt in November, Starship reached space for the first time but exploded soon after.\n\nIn its most recent flight in March, Starship made it much farther and broke apart in Earth's atmosphere as it attempted to return from space halfway around the globe.\n\nThe rocket's flight on Thursday is a repeat of its previous test but with the aim to get farther.\n\nThe rocket system's first stage, called Super Heavy, ignited its 33 Raptor engines to lift off, then was due to separate from the Starship second stage, which would then blast further into space.\n\nSuper Heavy is expected to re-ignite some engines and return toward the Gulf of Mexico for a \"soft splash-down\" to simulate a landing that would otherwise be on land.\n\nMeanwhile in space, Starship is expected to trek around the globe heading for the Indian Ocean to make a second attempt to survive the intense heat of atmospheric re-entry - the crucial point at which it failed in March.\n\nThe rocket is covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.\n\n\"The main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during reentry, ideally through max heating,\" Musk, CEO of SpaceX, wrote on social media on Saturday.\n\nMuch is riding on SpaceX's development of Starship, relied upon by NASA as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026 in a rivalry with China, which plans to send its astronauts there by 2030. China has made several recent advances in its lunar program, including a second landing on the moon's far side in a sample retrieval mission.\n\nDespite Starship's development appearing quicker than other rocket programs, it has been slower than Musk originally envisioned. A Japanese billionaire who initially paid to fly Starship around the moon canceled his flight last week, citing schedule uncertainties.\n\nAnd Musk's drive to rapidly build Starship has endangered SpaceX workers in Texas and California, a Reuters investigation found.\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falcon 9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_speed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hypersonic speed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far side of the Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

With favorable weather conditions and the Federal Aviation Administration's approval, the stage is set for another significant milestone in space exploration.\n\nThree previous tests ended in fiery conclusions, yet SpaceX considers these outcomes part of their rapid trial-and-error development strategy. According to SpaceX, \"The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy.\n\nStarship's design includes the Super Heavy booster and the upper stage, with both stages combined reaching a towering 397 feet (121 meters) -- 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty. The Super Heavy booster alone generates 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, nearly double that of NASA's certified Space Launch System.\n\nThe upcoming test aims to achieve a soft splashdown for the booster stage in the Gulf of Mexico and a controlled entry for the upper stage. SpaceX has implemented several software and hardware upgrades since the last test in March, which saw Starship fly halfway around the globe before re-entering the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean.\n\nSpaceX's hands-on approach to testing has previously yielded significant successes. The Falcon 9 rockets have become essential for NASA and commercial operations, the Dragon capsule regularly transports astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, and the Starlink satellite constellation provides internet coverage to numerous countries.\n\nHowever, time is of the essence. SpaceX must prepare for NASA's 2026 lunar mission, which will use a modified Starship as the lander vehicle. This mission involves placing a Starship in orbit and refueling it with multiple \"Starship tankers\" -- a complex and unprecedented engineering challenge.\n\nDespite these efforts, some, like Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, are growing impatient. Maezawa recently cancelled his planned Starship trip around the Moon with a crew of artists due to the uncertainty of the mission's timeline.", "source": {"uri": "leadership.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Leadership"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moon landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Launch System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statue of Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusaku_Maezawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yusaku Maezawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Space-X.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The launch window opens as early as 7 a.m. CT on Thursday.\n\nStarship is touted as the world's most powerful launch vehicle, standing 121 meters tall and weighing approximately 5,000 tonnes. It consists of two stages: the Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy rocket.\n\nFor the upcoming test, the company aims to achieve a soft splashdown of the Super Heavy booster in the Gulf of Mexico and a controlled re-entry and splashdown of the Starship in the Indian Ocean. SpaceX has implemented software and hardware upgrades to Starship since its last flight test to meet these objectives.\n\nWhy It Matters: During Starship's previous flight test on March 14, the spacecraft lost contact and broke apart while re-entering the atmosphere instead of splashing down in the Indian Ocean as planned. The booster also lost contact before achieving a soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. The entire flight lasted about an hour.\n\nSpaceX launched the Starship twice last year -- first in April and then in November.\n\nNASA is currently relying on the success of Starship to land humans back on the moon as part of its Artemis program. The last crewed lunar mission occurred in 1972 with Apollo 17. Since then, no crew has traveled beyond low-Earth orbit.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.\n\nRead More: 'Really An Incredible Person:' Jim Farley Says There's Respectful Rivalry With Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Outlines How Ford Charts Its Own EV Course\n\nImage via Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artemis program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_17", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 17"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Test_and_Measurement", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Test and Measurement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEB660A4_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 46, "textEnd": 52}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 145, "textEnd": 151}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 797, "textEnd": 805}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Video from the vehicle indicated it was falling apart at the end, but still operating.\n\n\"Splashdown confirmed! Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting fourth flight test of Starship!\" the company said on X.\n\nEarlier in the flight, the booster part of the rocket was brought back down to the Gulf of Mexico, to hover just above the water.\n\nThat's also a big step forward from previous test flights when the booster was destroyed in flight.\n\nThis was the fourth test flight in SpaceX's Starship development programme, and by far the most consequential.\n\nIt sets the company up to make further, rapid progress.\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean! Congratulations @SpaceX team on an epic achievement!!\" Mr Musk wrote on X.\n\nStarship dwarfs all previous rocket systems.\n\nThe 33 engines at its base produce 74 meganewtons of thrust. To put that in context, the US space agency's (Nasa) biggest rocket - the Space Launch System, or SLS - produces 39 meganewtons off the pad, and that's over 20% more than the old space shuttle system could generate.\n\nIf SpaceX engineers can perfect Starship, it will be revolutionary.\n\nIt's intended to be fully and rapidly reusable, to operate much like an aeroplane that can be refuelled and put back in the air in quick order.\n\nThis capability, along with the heft to carry more than a hundred tonnes to orbit in one go, would radically lower the cost of space activity.\n\nFor Elon Musk, Starship is key to realising his long-held ambition of taking people and supplies to Mars to build a human settlement. It will also assist his Starlink project which is establishing a global network of broadband internet satellites.\n\nThere are thousands of Starlink spacecraft in orbit already, but later models will be larger and heavier and Starship will be needed to get them to space.\n\nAmong the keenest observers of the test flights in Texas is Nasa.\n\nStarship is critical to the agency's Artemis programme to put astronauts back on the Moon this decade. A version of Starship would act as the landing craft, taking the crew from lunar orbit down to the surface - and then lifting them back off again. SpaceX, however, will first have to show it can produce a safe and reliable vehicle before astronauts are permitted to climb aboard.\n\nNasa has scheduled late 2026 for when it would like to see boots back on the lunar surface.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newton (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Launch System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_landing_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soft landing (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thrust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lunar orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/539193243c810955b574f80a937835d3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

This launch is now on target 8:50 a.m. EDT (1250 GMT).\n\nSpaceX will launch its next Starship megarocket test flight early Thursday, June 6, and if you want to watch it live, you'll need to know when and where to tune in. For that, dear space fans, we have what you need.\n\nAimed at SpaceX 8:50 a.m. EDT (1250 GMT) The Starship Flight 4 test flight of the Starship and superheavy megarocket launched from the company's Starbase facility in South Texas. Although that time may change slightly prior to launch, this is a good target for your watch party.\n\nSpaceX will host a free live webcast of the Starship Flight 4 launch 8:20 a.m. EDT (1220 GMT). You can watch the live stream here on Space.com, courtesy of SpaceX. Here's how and when to watch Starship's next release.\n\nCurrently, SpaceX's Starship is scheduled to launch on Flight 4 8:50 am EDT (1250 GMT), or 7:50 am CDT from the company's Starbase test site near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. However, SpaceX has a 120-minute window in which to launch the Flight 4 mission, so the Starship can fly at any time. 8 and 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT).\n\n\"As with all development experiments, the schedule is dynamic and subject to change, so stay tuned to our X account for updates,\" SpaceX wrote. In a job description.\n\nThe Starship and its Super Heavy Booster are the most powerful rockets in the world. When stacked together, they stand nearly 400 feet (122 meters) tall, with the first stage powered by 33 Raptor engines and the Starship upper stage by six Raptors.\n\nThe Starship launch system is designed to be fully reusable and capable of flying to the Moon, Mars or deep beyond, SpaceX said. NASA has selected the Starship to land Artemis 3 astronauts on the Moon in late 2026. But before the starship can land on the moon, it must prove it can reach space and re-enter safely. That's Flight 4.\n\n\"The fourth flight test shifts our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the Starship and SuperHeavy's ability to be reused,\" SpaceX said in a mission statement. SpaceX has launched three test flights so far, with the first two failing to reach space. Starship Flight 3 reached space, but both the starship and superheavy stages broke up on the way back to Earth.\n\nRelated: Check out our SpaceX Starship and Superheavy guide for a detailed look\n\nYes, you can watch SpaceX's Starship Flight 4 launch online, and you can choose where to watch.\n\nThe first and most obvious place to look would be output SpaceX's X account (formerly Twitter), Launching 30 minutes before departure - so, 8:20 a.m. EDT (1220 GMT).\n\nSpace.com will carry the SpaceX livestream ourselves VideoFromSpace YouTube ChannelAlso on our home page and at the top of this page.\n\nIf you want to see SpaceX's Flight 4 status before SpaceX's livestream, check it out NASASpaceflight.com's YouTube channelIt offers live views of SpaceX's starship, starbase pads and other locations, and will provide live commentary during the refueling process.\n\nIf you're in or near the Boca Chica, Texas area and want to see the Starship launch in person, there are several locations you can choose from.\n\nSpaceX doesn't have an official viewing platform, but you can visit several public beaches to watch the launch. Nearby South Padre Island offers clear views of the rocket from beaches near the Cameron County Amphitheater and Isla Blanca Park. You can also find similar beach-viewing spots on the nearby shores of Port Isabel.\n\nI actually watched the launch of Starship Flight 1 from South Padre Island's Cameron County Amphitheater in April 2023, and I can assure you that it offers unobstructed views (except for a few boats in the harbor) for spectators on the beach. (There is a public restroom, always a plus.) You should bring a folding chair, water, sunscreen, and other supplies. Traffic to and from the site can be heavy, so take this into account in your travel planning.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, SpaceX's Starship Flight 4 is expected to last just over an hour.\n\nFlight 4 will fly a similar route to SpaceX's Starship Flight 3 launch on March 14, aiming for a 65-minute journey from launch to Starship splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\n\"This flight path does not require a orbital burn for re-entry, maximizing public safety while providing an opportunity to meet our primary objective of controlled starship re-entry,\" SpaceX wrote in its mission statement.\n\nThe Super Heavy Booster, meanwhile, is expected to fly for approximately 7 minutes, with a landing burn scheduled for 6 minutes, 43 seconds. SpaceX hopes to make a controlled \"landing\" and gentle splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, miles off the coast of Boca Chica.\n\nIf SpaceX can't launch Starship Flight 4 on June 6, the company has at least one (if not more) backup days.\n\nOfficials in Cameron County, the region of South Texas that includes SpaceX's Starbase facility, have listed. June 7 and June 8 are backup daysAccording to A beach closure advisory to the public. Those closures will run from 12 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time, or approximately 1 a.m. to 3 p.m. EDT, both days.\n\nOf course, any backup launch effort depends on how far SpaceX goes with the starship and superheavy fuel process. In the past, SpaceX has said it would take several days to recover the more than 10 million pounds of super-cold liquid methane and liquid oxygen propellant needed for launch.\n\nIf a technical problem delays the launch of Starship Flight 4, SpaceX may have to wait until it is resolved before trying again.", "source": {"uri": "highlandstoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mid Florida

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nSuper Heavy landed in the Gulf of Mexico minutes after lift-off. But Starship's splashdown is even more impressive. The rocket ship flew into space, briefly cruised above Earth, and screamed back through the atmosphere at about 17,000 mph, enduring ultra-heated plasma lashing it at temperatures up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAs it approached the Indian Ocean, Starship fired its engines in an effort to flip itself upright and slow itself down, practicing a controlled landing. It's not clear how soft the landing was, as the spaceship was clearly shredding pieces on the livestream and visibility became extremely poor as it approached the water.\n\nWhatever happened, the ship completed its mission by sinking into the ocean.\n\nBelieve it or not, cannon-balling into the sea is a big deal for Starship. Last time it attempted the feat, in March, it disintegrated mid-fall.\n\nNow Starship and its Super Heavy booster are one big step closer to fulfilling their revolutionary promise of being the first fully reusable rocket system capable of reaching orbit. If Starship can translate this ocean landing into a land landing, it could slash the cost of spaceflight tenfold.\n\nThen, of course, there are Elon Musk's Mars ambitions. Starship is the vehicle that's supposed to build his city on the red planet, with a population of 1 million people.\n\n\"No rocket before this has had the potential to extend life to another planet,\" Musk, who founded SpaceX in 2002 for this very purpose, said in a speech standing before Starship at the company's Texas facilities in April.\n\nThe giant launch system, standing taller than the Statue of Liberty, fired its Raptor engines and roared past its Texas launchpad on Thursday morning.\n\nThe launch wasn't perfect -- one engine failed to light. But the rocket still worked.\n\nJust like on its last flight in March, the rocket's Super Heavy booster separated from the Starship rocket-ship high above Earth, allowing the winged spacecraft to continue into space.\n\nThe booster fell back to Earth, practiced firing its engines to lower itself as if it were landing on solid ground, and splash-landed in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThat checked off SpaceX's first vehicle-return goal for the flight. Next was Starship itself.\n\nOn its last plummet back to Earth, in March, Starship fell out of communications. SpaceX eventually declared it \"lost,\" likely broken apart or blown up by the stress of reentering the atmosphere.\n\nBut on Thursday the rocket ship survived the fall, splashing into the ocean and completing its first full flight.\n\nIt wasn't unscathed, though. One of its flaps began to visibly rip off and shred mid-fall, and the camera offering the live view cracked.\n\nNo orbital launch system on Earth is fully reusable. SpaceX pioneered reusing the lower stage of a rocket -- its booster -- with the Falcon 9, the workhorse that takes NASA missions and Starlink satellites to orbit.\n\nStarship-Super Heavy is poised to be the first system to also reuse the upper stage -- the spaceship that enters orbit after the booster falls away.\n\nIndeed, a Starship prototype already proved that it could lower itself to a soft landing from a flight six miles above Texas, albeit after several explosive failed attempts. But returning from orbital heights to land in one piece is another feat.\n\nOn its next flight, SpaceX might attempt to catch the Super Heavy booster with giant \"chopsticks\" on its Texas launch tower.\n\n\"I think the odds of actually catching the booster with the tower, probably like 80% or 90% this year,\" Musk said in his April speech. \"Which is insane. Like actually, when we first talked about it, it sounded so batshit crazy.\"\n\nAs for Starship, the upper stage, it might not descend from space to an actual landing pad until next year, he said.\n\n\"We just need to be confident that we can get through the high heating portion of the reentry reliably, and then we will bring the ship back and we'll land on the tower as well,\" Musk said.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "morgan_mcfall_johnsen@businessinsider.com", "name": "Morgan McFall-Johnsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statue of Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Undeveloped_or_Vacant", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Undeveloped or Vacant", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6661bffccc442a2f676e7e3e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Mission duration, from start to finish: one hour and five minutes.\n\nThe 39-story-tall Super Heavy-Starship rocket is by far the most powerful launcher in the world with more than twice the liftoff thrust of the space shuttle, NASA's legendary Apollo program Saturn 5 and the Space Launch System rocket designed for the agency's Artemis moon rocket.\n\nPowered by 33 methane-burning Raptor engines, the 230-foot-tall Super Heavy booster generates a staggering 16 million pounds of thrust. It is designed to propel the Starship upper stage out of the lower atmosphere before falling away for a rocket-powered descent to landing, refurbishment and reuse.\n\nThe 160-foot-tall Starship, powered by six Raptors, also is designed to be fully reusable, capable of tail-first landings back on Earth, on the moon or even Mars.\n\nFor the Super Heavy-Starship's initial test flights, however, recovery was not an option. The goal was to \"simply\" get both stages back to the lower atmosphere intact and under control. For Thursday's flight, both stages were programmed to attempt rocket-powered descents mimicking actual landing procedures. But both were expected to sink on impact.\n\n\"The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship.\"\n\nDuring three previous flights, two in 2023 and the most recent in March, the Super Heavy and Starship stages suffered catastrophic failures before all the test objectives could be met. But with each flight, SpaceX implemented hardware and software upgrades that resulted in dramatically improved performance.\n\nIn third test flight, the Starship upper stage made it into space, looped around the planet and began a planned descent over the Indian Ocean before breaking up in the upper atmosphere. The Super Heavy booster made it back into the lower atmosphere over the Gulf of Mexico before control was lost.\n\nBut SpaceX hailed the flight as an overall success and made more changes to improve performance during Thursday's test.\n\nGetting the Super Heavy-Starship flying on a regular basis is critical to NASA's Artemis moon program. NASA awarded SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract in 2021 to develop a variant of the Starship upper stage to carry astronauts from lunar orbit down to the surface and back. Artemis crews will travel to and from the moon using Lockheed Martin-built Orion capsules.\n\nTo reach the moon, multiple Super Heavy tanker flights will have to be launched to robotically refuel a Starship upper stage already in low-Earth orbit. The Starship lander then will fly itself to lunar orbit to await the Artemis moonwalkers.\n\nNASA's contract requires one unpiloted lunar landing test flight before astronauts will make an actual landing attempt. Artemis managers are targeting late 2026 for the first lunar landing with astronauts on board.\n\nBut that will depend on SpaceX launching enough Super Heavy-Starship flights to demonstrate reliability. While SpaceX's philosophy is to fly frequently, learn from mistakes and fly again, NASA will require a long string of successful flights before the agency will deem it safe to put astronauts aboard.\n\nSneak peek: Who Wanted Nicki Lenway Dead?\n\n11-year-old Missouri boy helps erase meal debt at his school\n\nBoeing Starliner finally launches and other top headlines", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thrust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artemis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Launch System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Corporation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mpYqc5gPdnmV7tE6tEpEvQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cbs_news_articles_189/0b36d2f91c6107fd4a623a1ea655063a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (meters).\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable.

It will also be livestreamed by SpaceX on its website and via social media.\n\nThe uncrewed spacecraft is set to fly a similar path as on its previous mission, which, while the company's most successful yet, ended with the loss of both the Super Heavy booster and upper-stage Starship. Each Starship has made it farther and accomplished more objectives than previous tests before failing, either by blowing up or disintegrating in the atmosphere.\n\nSpaceX's focus for this flight is demonstrating the ability to return and reuse both stages.\n\n\"The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said Starship represents the future of the company's satellite launch, astronaut, military contract and other businesses. It is due to be used by NASA in the next few years to land astronauts on the moon for the first time since 1972.\n\nThe first Starship launch was in April 2023. The rocket obliterated its launch pad, hurling chunks of concrete and metal into the surrounding wetlands, touching off wildfires and kicking up a plume of sand and pulverized concrete that rained down on residents 6 miles away. The rocket exploded just minutes after liftoff at an altitude of about 25 miles.\n\nDuring the next attempt in November, the rocket's stages successfully separated and Starship reached space for the first time but exploded soon after.\n\nIn its third flight in March, Starship made it much farther but broke apart in Earth's atmosphere as it attempted to return from space halfway around the globe.\n\nOn Wednesday evening at Starbase, preparation work for the fourth launch churned on amid increasing traffic and visits to the beach where the 400-foot-tall rocket stood on its launch platform.\n\nREAD NEXT: A timeline of SpaceX in Texas\n\nVisitors to Starbase now pass a new three story-tall mural depicting Musk emblazoned with the words \"Ad Astra\" hovering above him. The Latin phrase means \"to the stars.\"\n\nThe artwork was created by a French tech entrepreneur who asked to be identified as \"Louis.\" He said he came to the U.S. a month ago with a vision to create a Musk mural based on a meme of the tech mogul.\n\n\"So, this was a funny way to give a tribute to Elon,\" he said.\n\nFurther along Texas 4 at the SpaceX production facility, a new $100 million Starfactory and new parking garage appear nearly complete. At least six sections of the new launch tower that will stand next to the current one are lined up in a parking lot awaiting installation. At the launch site, workers have taken down the recently installed \"Gateway to Mars\" sign to make space to build the new launch tower.\n\nCloser to the beach, people wandered along the path across the dunes to the flats next to the launch pad.\n\nOne couple sat in their lawn chairs at the perimeter line SpaceX uses to keep people from wandering too close.\n\nNearby, a father and his two daughters from San Antonio looked up at the Starship as it was being prepared for flight.\n\n\"We have just been completely just amazed with what SpaceX has done,\" said Peter Van Delden. \"It's been so fascinating to see the transition over the years and then you're just unbelievably fortunate to have Boca Chica as the base of Starbase.\"\n\nSpaceX said the launch window for Thursday's flight will open at 7 a.m. If that one doesn't work out, it could go at the same time either Friday or Saturday.\n\nThe event will be livestreamed on the SpaceX website and on X @spacex beginning at 6:30 a.m.\n\nVarious other space Youtube channels such as Everyday Astronaut and NASA Spaceflight will also be broadcasting.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort

Ground teams whooped and hollered as the upper stage glowed a fiery red during its descent, in footage relayed by SpaceX's Starlink satellite network.\n\nA piece of flying debris even cracked the camera lens, but the ship ultimately stuck the landing.\n\n\"Congratulations SpaceX on Starship's successful test flight this morning!\" NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on X. \"We are another step closer to returning humanity to the Moon through #Artemis -- then looking onward to Mars.\"\n\n- Twice as powerful as Saturn V -\n\nDesigned to eventually be fully reusable, Starship stands 397 feet (121 meters) tall with both stages combined -- 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty.\n\nIts Super Heavy booster produces 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rockets used during the Apollo missions -- though later versions should be more powerful still.\n\nSpaceX's strategy of carrying out tests in the real world rather than in labs has paid off in the past.\n\nIts Falcon 9 rockets have come to be workhorses for NASA and the commercial sector, its Dragon capsule sends astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, and its Starlink internet satellite constellation now covers dozens of countries.\n\nBut the clock is ticking for SpaceX to be ready for NASA's planned return of astronauts to the Moon in 2026, using a modified Starship as the final vehicle to take astronauts from orbit down to the surface.\n\nTo accomplish this, SpaceX will need to first place a primary Starship in orbit, then use multiple \"Starship tankers\" to fill it up with supercooled fuel for the onward journey -- a complex engineering feat that has never before been accomplished.\n\nAt least one SpaceX fan has grown tired of waiting. Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa announced this week he has canceled a planned trip around the Moon on Starship with a crew of artists, because he has no idea when it might actually happen.\n\nia/st", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chandan_khanna@ktbs.com", "name": "Chandan Khanna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

It represents the future of the company's dominant satellite launch and astronaut business and is set to be utilized by NASA in the coming years to land the first astronauts on the moon since 1972.\n\nEach Starship rocket has progressed further in its testing objectives compared to previous tests before failing, either by exploding or breaking apart in the atmosphere. The rocket's first launch in April 2023 exploded minutes after liftoff, approximately 25 miles (40 km) above ground. During the subsequent attempt in November, Starship reached space for the first time but exploded shortly after. In its most recent flight in March, Starship traveled much farther but broke apart in Earth's atmosphere while attempting to return from space halfway around the globe.\n\nThe flight is a repetition of the previous test but with the goal of reaching a greater distance. The rocket's first stage, called Super Heavy, ignited its 33 Raptor engines to lift off and was expected to separate from the Starship second stage, which would then propel further into space. Super Heavy is anticipated to re-ignite some engines and return to the Gulf of Mexico for a \"soft splash-down\" to simulate a landing that would otherwise occur on land.\n\nMeanwhile, Starship is expected to travel around the globe, heading for the Indian Ocean to make a second attempt at surviving the intense heat of atmospheric re-entry - the crucial point at which it failed in March. The rocket is equipped with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.\n\nNasa is relying on SpaceX's development of Starship as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026, competing with China, which plans to send its astronauts there by 2030. China has recently made several advancements in its lunar program, including a second landing on the moon's far side in a sample retrieval mission.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The giant rocket blasted off amid a giant plume of smoke and steam, and though one of the rocket's 33 engines quickly shut down, Starship safety reached orbit while, for the first time, the first stage successfully returned to a simulated landing - a \"soft splashdown\" - in the ocean.\n\nWhile SpaceX hopes to eventually use the craft to fly astronauts to the moon and even Mars, for this test flight, no humans are aboard.\n\nStarship is SpaceX's reusable spacecraft, designed to carry over 100 tons of cargo - and, eventually, people - to space and then fly back to Earth to be launched again.\n\nThe Starship spacecraft is launched atop SpaceX's new Super Heavy booster, a 33-engine monstrosity - also reusable - that is more powerful than even NASA's Saturn moon rockets of the 1960s. Fully stacked, the Starship combination reaches 397 feet high.\n\nThe rocket is being developed to reduce the cost of launches and possibly take humans to the moon and Mars. NASA plans to use Starship as its lunar lander during the upcoming Artemis missions later this decade, landing astronauts on the moon and then carrying them back up to the Orion capsule.\n\nThe first Starship launch, back in April 2023, ended with an in-flight explosion just before stage separation. An investigation later determined that leaking fuel lines inside the booster had caught fire, which ultimately led to the loss of communication to the booster engines and control of the rocket.\n\nMeanwhile, the launch blasted sand and debris from the launch pad, creating a technical and an environmental hazard. The company installed a water-deluge system for the second flight to keep that from happening.\n\nThat second flight, though, also ended with an explosion, but later in the ascent. Unlike the first mission, all of the Raptor engines fire up and continued to burn through stage separation. Moments later, one engine \"failed energetically\" - likely due to a liquid oxygen filter blockage - leading to an explosion that destroyed the booster.\n\nThe Starship upper stage continued toward orbit until a leak during liquid oxygen venting led to a fire, cutting power to all six engines, which in turn activated the vehicle's automatic self-destruct.\n\nThe third flight, in March, was much more successful. Starship reached space, allowing engineers to test a variety of systems, including the craft's new payload door and demonstrate propellant transfer while the upper stage was coasting. But the craft did not survive reentry.\n\nOnboard video cameras provided stunning views of the fiery plasma building up around the reentering craft before it spun out of control and burned up.\n\nA primary goal of the fourth test flight is gathering more information about reentry heating and the performance of the protective heat shield tiles.\n\nThe test-until-you-fail process will continue for SpaceX, using lessons learned from the success and failures on this latest flight.", "source": {"uri": "fox4news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reusable spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artemis program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_lander", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lunar lander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orion (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquid oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saturn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox4news.com/www.fox4news.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1280/720/starship.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Within minutes, the first-stage booster separated from the spacecraft and splashed into the gulf precisely as planned, after firing its engines.\n\nThe spacecraft reached an altitude of nearly 130 miles (211 kilometers), traveling at more 16,000 mph (26,000 kph), before beginning its descent. Live views showed parts of the spacecraft breaking away during the intense heat of reentry, but a cracked camera lens obscured the images.\n\nThe spacecraft remained intact enough to transmit data all the way to its targeted splashdown site in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt was a critical milestone in the company's plan to eventually reuse the rocket that NASA and Musk are counting on to get humanity to the moon and then Mars.\n\n\"What a show it has been,\" SpaceX launch commentator Kate Tice said from Mission Control at company headquarters in California.\n\nSpaceX came close to avoiding explosions in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (meters).\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable.

Nothing is being recovered from Thursday's flight.\n\nNASA has ordered a pair of Starships for two moon-landing missions by astronauts, on tap for later this decade.

The projectile was launched in the southern region of Texas.\n\nThe two-stage spacecraft, which was launched from the Starbase launch site at Boca Chica Village on the Gulf Coast of Texas, transported the Starship cruise ship atop its formidable Super Heavy rocket booster until it reached its destination. This is the most recent trial voyage of the test-to-failure rocket development campaign that Elon Musk's business is currently conducting.\n\nThe Starship, which is approximately 400 feet (122 meters) in height and is intended to be more potent and cheaper than SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, is a representation of the company's future dominance in the satellite launch and astronaut industries.\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) plans to employ it in the future to dispatch the first humans to set foot on the moon since 1972.\n\nIn terms of the distance traveled before failure, each Starship rocket has surpassed previous testing objectives, either by igniting or disintegrating in the atmosphere.\n\nThe rocket exploded in April 2023, just minutes after it had lifted off, at an altitude of approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) above the Earth's surface. In November of that year, Starship embarked on its inaugural space voyage; however, it encountered a calamitous malfunction shortly thereafter.\n\nNevertheless, Starship attempted to return from orbit halfway around the globe during its most recent journey, which occurred in March. Nevertheless, it was only able to travel a significant distance before it disintegrated in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe rocket will take another voyage on Thursday, but this time, the goal is to travel a greater distance than it did in the previous test.\n\nThe Super Heavy stage of the rocket system was intended to detach from the Starship's second stage and propel itself into orbit after igniting all 33 of its Raptor engines to initiate liftoff. Nevertheless, this did not transpire.\n\nIt is anticipated that Super Heavy will reignite a few of its engines and subsequently return to the Gulf of Mexico to perform a \"soft splash-down\" that is comparable to a touchdown on land.\n\nIn the interim, it is anticipated that Starship will complete a full circuit of the planet and subsequently travel to the Indian Ocean to attempt a second attempt to endure the intense heat of atmospheric re-entry, which was the critical point at which it failed in March.\n\nThe shielding is intended to protect it from the extreme heat it will experience as it travels through the Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.\n\nOn Saturday, Elon Musk, the Chief Executive Officer of SpaceX, issued the following statement on social media: \"The primary objective of this mission is to penetrate the atmosphere at a much deeper level during reentry, ideally through maximum heating.\"\n\nIn order to contend with China, which intends to send humans to the moon by 2030 and return them by 2026, NASA is heavily reliant on the development of Starship by SpaceX. The lunar program of China has recently made substantial progress in a variety of ways, one of which was the successful landing of a sample retrieval mission on the moon's far side.\n\nMusk believed that the development of Starship would advance more rapidly than previous rocket programs; however, the truth is that it has progressed at a slower pace than he had anticipated. A Japanese millionaire who had initially paid to fly his Starship around the moon decided to postpone his voyage this past week, citing schedule issues as the reason for his decision.\n\nFurthermore, an investigation conducted by Reuters determined that Musk's aspiration to expedite the development of Starship has endangered SpaceX employees in the states of Texas and California.\n\nSEE ALSO:",

The spacecraft on top was aiming for a half-lap around the planet with a splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nSpaceX was looking to avoid explosions this time by controlling the descents. Minutes after Thursday morning's liftoff, the first-stage booster separated from the spacecraft and splashed into the gulf precisely as planned, after firing its engines.\n\n\"And we have splashdown!\" SpaceX launch commentator Kate Tice announced from Mission Control at company headquarters in California.\n\nIt was a critical milestone in the company's plan to eventually return Starship's Super Heavy booster to its launch site for reuse.\n\nSpaceX came close to avoiding explosion in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (meters).\n\nPeople wait for SpaceX's Starship rocket launch, designed to eventually send astronauts to the moon and beyond, as it launches on its fourth flight test from the company's Boca Chica launchpad, near Brownsville, Texas, on June 6, 2024.

The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable. That's why SpaceX wants to control the booster's entry into the gulf and the spacecraft's descent into the Indian Ocean -- it's intended as practice for planned future landings. Nothing is being recovered from Thursday's flight.\n\nNASA has ordered a pair of Starships for two moon-landing missions by astronauts, on tap for later this decade.

Elon Musk's aerospace company is preparing for the next test of its Starship spacecraft, a fully reusable megarocket designed to travel to the Moon and Mars that last went up in the air in March.\n\nThe launch window for the latest flight test opens as early as 8 a.m. ET on Thursday. The livestream, which will open about 30 minutes before launch, can be viewed on SpaceX's website or on the company's X (formerly Twitter) account.\n\nSpaceX first unveiled plans for the 400-foot Starship in 2017 before making its first launch attempt in April 2023. In that attempt, the Starship failed, as did SpaceX's self-destruction system. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) investigated the incident and gave approval for a second flight in November, which showed a better performance before it exploded -- twice -- just minutes into the air.\n\nThe hope is that Thursday's attempt will be more successful -- and there's reason to believe that might be the case. SpaceX's third test created a wealth of new data that showed a lack any critical safety issues, according to the FAA, although its upper stage fell to pieces on reentry and the company was forced to explode the Super Heavy booster above the Gulf of Mexico. On May 23, SpaceX completed its second wet dress rehearsal with two stacked prototype stages.\n\nThe Starship rocket has received \"several software and hardware upgrades\" to address issues from the last test. SpaceX will also make some operational changes to improve performance. Like the last test, the fourth flight aims to splash down in the Indian Ocean.\n\n\"We're continuing to rapidly develop Starship, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as quickly as possible as we build a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and beyond,\" SpaceX said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geocentric orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Testing_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Testing and Tools", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/fbbc9d7f04857a507170512f47e4c603.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 1271, "textEnd": 1277}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

During the next attempt in November, Starship reached space for the first time but exploded soon after.\n\nIn its most recent flight in March, Starship made it much farther and broke apart in Earth's atmosphere as it attempted to return from space halfway around the globe.\n\nThe rocket's flight on Thursday will be a repeat of its previous test but with the aim to get farther. The rocket system's first stage, called Super Heavy, is set to ignite its 33 Raptor engines to lift off, then separate from the Starship second stage, which would then blast further into space.\n\nSuper Heavy is expected to re-ignite some engines and return toward the Gulf of Mexico for a \"soft splash-down\" to simulate a landing that would otherwise be on land.\n\nMeanwhile in space, Starship is expected to trek around the globe heading for the Indian Ocean to make a second attempt to survive the intense heat of atmospheric re-entry - the crucial point at which it failed in March.\n\nThe rocket is covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.\n\n\"The main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during reentry, ideally through max heating,\" Musk, CEO of SpaceX, wrote on social media on Saturday.\n\nMuch is riding on SpaceX's development of Starship, relied upon by NASA as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026 in a rivalry with China, which plans to send its astronauts there by 2030. China has made several recent advances in its lunar program, including a second landing on the moon's far side in a sample retrieval mission.\n\nDespite Starship's development appearing quicker than other rocket programs, it has been slower than Musk originally envisioned. A Japanese billionaire who initially paid to fly Starship around the moon canceled his flight last week, citing schedule uncertainties.\n\nAnd Musk's drive to rapidly build Starship has endangered SpaceX workers in Texas and California, a Reuters investigation found.\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_speed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hypersonic speed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far side of the Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_diving", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Underwater diving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 56}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The launch window runs for two hours.\n\nThis flight follows three prior demonstration missions, each progressively more successful, of SpaceX's privately-developed mega-rocket. The last time Starship flew -- on March 14 -- it completed an eight-and-a-half minute climb into space, but the ship was unable to maneuver itself as it coasted nearly 150 miles (250 km) above Earth. Ultimately, this controllability problem caused the rocket to break apart during reentry.\n\nOn Thursday's flight, SpaceX officials will expect the ascent portion of the test flight to be similarly successful as the launch in March. The objectives this time will be to demonstrate Starship's ability to survive the most extreme heating of reentry, when temperatures peak at 2,600\u00b0 Fahrenheit (1,430\u00b0 Celsius) as the vehicle plunges into the atmosphere at more than 20 times the speed of sound.\n\nSpaceX officials also hope to see the Super Heavy booster guide itself toward a soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico just offshore from the company's launch site, known as Starbase, in Cameron County, Texas.\n\n\"The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,\" SpaceX wrote in an overview of the mission.\n\nLast month, SpaceX completed a \"wet dress rehearsal\" at Starbase, where the launch team fully loaded the rocket with cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen propellants. Before the practice countdown, SpaceX test-fired the booster and ship at the launch site. More recently, technicians installed components of the rocket's self-destruct system, which would activate to blow up the rocket if it flies off course.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, SpaceX lowered the Starship upper stage from the top of the Super Heavy booster, presumably to perform final touch-ups to ship's heat shield, comprised of 18,000 hexagonal ceramic tiles to protect its stainless-steel structure during reentry. Ground teams were expected to raise the ship, or upper stage, back on top of the booster some time Wednesday, returning the rocket to its full height of 397 feet (121 meters) ahead of Thursday morning's launch window.\n\nThe tick-tock of Starship's fourth flight\n\nIf all goes according to plan, SpaceX's launch team will start loading 10 million pounds of super-cold propellants into the rocket around 49 minutes before liftoff Thursday. The methane and liquid oxygen will first flow into the smaller tanks on the ship, then into the larger tanks on the booster.\n\nThe rocket should be fully loaded about three minutes prior to launch, and following a sequence of automated checks, the computer controlling the countdown will give the command to light the booster's 33 Raptor engines. Three seconds later, the rocket will begin its vertical climb off the launch mount, with its engines capable of producing more than 16 million pounds of thrust at full power.\n\nHeading east from the Texas Gulf Coast, the rocket will exceed the speed of sound in about a minute, then begin shutting down its 33 main engines around 2 minutes and 41 seconds after liftoff. Then, just as the Super Heavy booster jettisons to begin a descent back to Earth, Starship's six Raptor engines will ignite to continue pushing the upper portion of the rocket into space. Starship's engines are expected to burn until T+plus 8 minutes, 23 seconds, accelerating the rocket to near orbital velocity with enough energy to fly an arcing trajectory halfway around the world to the Indian Ocean.\n\nAll of this will be similar to the events of the last Starship launch in March. What differs in the flight plan this time involves the attempts to steer the booster and ship back to Earth. This is important to lay the groundwork for future flights, when SpaceX wants to bring the Super Heavy booster -- the size of the fuselage of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet -- to a landing back at its launch pad. Eventually, SpaceX also intends to recover reusable Starships back at Starbase or other spaceports.\n\nBased on the results of the March test flight, SpaceX still has a lot to prove in these areas. On that flight, the engines on the Super Heavy booster could not complete all the burns required to guide the rocket toward the splashdown zone in the Gulf of Mexico. The booster lost control as it plummeted toward the ocean.\n\nEngineers traced the failure to blockage in a filter where liquid oxygen flows into the Raptor engines. Notably, a similar problem occurred on the second Starship test flight last November. The Super Heavy booster awaiting launch Thursday has additional hardware to improve propellant filtration capabilities, according to SpaceX. The company also implemented \"operational changes\" on the booster for the upcoming test flight, including jettison of the Super Heavy's staging ring, which sits between the booster and ship during launch, to reduce the rocket's mass during descent.\n\nSpaceX has a lot of experience bringing back its fleet of Falcon 9 boosters. The company now boasts a streak of more than 240 successful rocket landings in a row, so it's reasonable to expect SpaceX will overcome the challenge of recovering the larger Super Heavy booster.\n\nThe thorny issue of tiles\n\nStarship, however, is a different animal. Despite having fewer engines, SpaceX's ambitions for the ship require it to be immensely more complex than the booster. Ultimately, these goals for Starship include satellite deployments, interplanetary transport, landings on the Moon and Mars, and refueling in orbit. But first, SpaceX must show that Starship can reliably travel between Earth's surface and low-Earth orbit.\n\nOn Flight 3 in March, the Starship upper stage lost the ability to control its orientation after turning off its main engines upon reaching space. SpaceX said engineers determined this was due to clogged valves used by reaction control thrusters on the upper stage, and the company said it is adding additional roll control thrusters on upcoming Starships.\n\nThe roll control problem caused SpaceX to miss achieving two test objectives on the last Starship test flight. One was an attempt to reignite one of the ship's Raptor engines in space, a capability that SpaceX must routinely use on future Starship flights. The other was the controlled reentry of the 165-foot-long (50-meter) upper stage. Without fully functioning thrusters, the ship fell back into the atmosphere in the wrong attitude, and SpaceX lost contact with the vehicle due to excess heating.\n\nThis time, SpaceX will try to keep it simple. Of course, simple is a relative term when it comes to spaceflight and Starship. On Flight 4, there's no planned restart of a Raptor engine while the ship is in space. The lack of such a test on this flight means the next launch -- Flight 5 -- will likely target a similar suborbital trajectory, rather than going all the way into orbit. Presumably, SpaceX, and perhaps federal regulators, would like to see Starship prove it can execute a braking burn to return to Earth, rather than putting the vehicle into orbit and having it reenter the atmosphere unguided if the engine start failed.\n\nThis vehicle also doesn't have a payload bay door like the last Starship opened and closed in space. Instead, the ship will drift through space until its flight path brings it back into the upper atmosphere around 47 minutes into the flight.\n\nThe ceramic tiles that make up Starship's heat shield will get special attention on this week's test flight. The tiles, each about the size of a dinner plate, are similar in function to those used on NASA's space shuttle, in that they insulate the ship's primary structure from the blistering heat of reentry.\n\nElon Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO, wrote on X last week that gathering data on the tiles' performance in flight is vital.\n\n\"This is a matter of execution, rather than ideas,\" he wrote. \"Unless we make the heat shield relatively heavy, as is the case with our Dragon capsule, where reliability is paramount, we will only discover the weak points by flying.\"\n\nIn order to make real Musk's lofty ambitions for a fully and rapidly reusable rocket, Starship's heat shield must be resilient and require little in the way of refurbishment between flights. SpaceX has a long way to go there.\n\n\"Right now, we are not resilient to loss of a single tile in most places, as the secondary containment material will probably not survive,\" Musk wrote. \"This is a thorny issue indeed, given that vast resources have been applied to solve it, thus far to no avail.\"\n\nIf it survives the heat of reentry, Starship will descend into the lower atmosphere belly first and decelerate to subsonic speed under the control of aerodynamic flaps, similar to miniature wings. Finally, the ship will reignite a subset of its Raptor engines -- probably two -- and quickly flip from horizontal to vertical to settle into the waters of the Indian Ocean between Madagascar and Australia.\n\nRegulatory waivers\n\nThe FAA made some changes with the launch license for SpaceX's fourth Starship test flight that could speed up the process of issuing licenses for future launches.\n\nWith the first three Starship launches, the FAA license required SpaceX conduct a mishap investigation with federal oversight if the rocket failed to reach its destination intact. The outcome of the last test flight -- Starship's breakup over the Indian Ocean -- triggered such an investigation by SpaceX.\n\nThe FAA is charged with ensuring public safety during commercial space launches and reentries. In a Starship mishap investigation, the agency's role is to oversee the inquiry and accept the results of SpaceX's investigation before issuing a license for the next launch.\n\nThat will change with the fourth Starship test flight.\n\n\"As part of its request for license modification, SpaceX proposed three scenarios involving the Starship entry that would not require an investigation in the event of the loss of the vehicle,\" the FAA said in a statement.\n\nBased on language in the code of federal regulations, the FAA has the option to approve these exceptions. The FAA approved three possible outcomes for the upcoming Starship test flight that would not trigger what would likely be a months-long mishap investigation.\n\nThese exceptions include the failure of Starship's heat shield during reentry, if the ship's flap system is unable to provide sufficient control under high dynamic pressure, and the failure of the Raptor engine system during the landing burn. If one of these scenarios occurs, the FAA will not require a mishap investigation, provided there was no serious injury or fatality to anyone on the ground, no damage to unrelated property, and no debris outside designated hazard areas.\n\nThis change is quite significant for the FAA and SpaceX. It shows that federal regulators, suffering from staffing and funding shortages, are making moves to try and keep up with SpaceX's rapid, and often ever-changing, development of Starship.\n\n\"If a different anomaly occurs with the Starship vehicle, an investigation may be warranted, as well as if an anomaly occurs with the Super Heavy booster rocket,\" the FAA said.", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_clark@arstechnica.com", "name": "Stephen Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Commercial_Space_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Office of Commercial Space Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liquid oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speed of sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/starship1-760x380.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 873, "textEnd": 881}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The three previous flight demos ended in explosions. This time, the rocket and the spacecraft managed to splash down in a controlled fashion, making the hourlong flight the longest and most successful yet.\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said via X.\n\nStarship was empty as it soared above the Gulf of Mexico and headed east on a flight to the Indian Ocean. Within minutes, the first-stage booster separated from the spacecraft and splashed into the gulf precisely as planned, after firing its engines.\n\nThe spacecraft reached an altitude of nearly 130 miles (211 kilometers), traveling at more 16,000 mph (26,000 kph), before beginning its descent. Live views showed parts of the spacecraft breaking away during the intense heat of reentry, but a cracked camera lens obscured the images.\n\nThe spacecraft remained intact enough to transmit data all the way to its targeted splashdown site in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt was a critical milestone in the company's plan to eventually reuse the rocket that NASA and Musk are counting on to get humanity to the moon and then Mars.\n\n\"What a show it has been,\" SpaceX launch commentator Kate Tice said from Mission Control at company headquarters in California.\n\nSpaceX came close to avoiding explosions in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (meters).\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable. That's why SpaceX wants to control the booster's entry into the gulf and the spacecraft's descent into the Indian Ocean -- it's intended as practice for planned future landings.

Ground teams whooped and hollered as the upper stage glowed a fiery red during its descent, in footage relayed by SpaceX's Starlink satellite network.\n\nMore from this section New Rochelle celebrates opening of 'Socceroof' sports facility X formally allowing users to post consensual adult content Hunter Biden's Federal Firearms Trial Begins\n\nA piece of flying debris even cracked the camera lens, but the ship ultimately stuck the landing.\n\n\"Congratulations SpaceX on Starship's successful test flight this morning!\" NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on X. \"We are another step closer to returning humanity to the Moon through #Artemis -- then looking onward to Mars.\"\n\n- Twice as powerful as Saturn V -\n\nDesigned to eventually be fully reusable, Starship stands 397 feet (121 meters) tall with both stages combined -- 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty.\n\nIts Super Heavy booster produces 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rockets used during the Apollo missions -- though later versions should be more powerful still.\n\nSpaceX's strategy of carrying out tests in the real world rather than in labs has paid off in the past.\n\nIts Falcon 9 rockets have come to be workhorses for NASA and the commercial sector, its Dragon capsule sends astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, and its Starlink internet satellite constellation now covers dozens of countries.\n\nBut the clock is ticking for SpaceX to be ready for NASA's planned return of astronauts to the Moon in 2026, using a modified Starship as the final vehicle to take astronauts from orbit down to the surface.\n\nTo accomplish this, SpaceX will need to first place a primary Starship in orbit, then use multiple \"Starship tankers\" to fill it up with supercooled fuel for the onward journey -- a complex engineering feat that has never before been accomplished.\n\nAt least one SpaceX fan has grown tired of waiting. Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa announced this week he has canceled a planned trip around the Moon on Starship with a crew of artists, because he has no idea when it might actually happen.\n\nia/st", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chandan_khanna@reformer.com", "name": "Chandan Khanna", "type":

The three previous flight demos ended in explosions. This time, the rocket and the spacecraft managed to splash down in a controlled fashion, making the hourlong flight the longest and most successful yet.\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said via X.\n\nStarship was empty as it soared above the Gulf of Mexico and headed east on a flight to the Indian Ocean. Within minutes, the first-stage booster separated from the spacecraft and splashed into the gulf precisely as planned, after firing its engines.\n\nThe spacecraft reached an altitude of nearly 130 miles (211 kilometers), traveling at more 16,000 mph (26,000 kph), before beginning its descent. Live views showed parts of the spacecraft breaking away during the intense heat of reentry, but a cracked camera lens obscured the images.\n\nThe spacecraft remained intact enough to transmit data all the way to its targeted splashdown site in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt was a critical milestone in the company's plan to eventually reuse the rocket that NASA and Musk are counting on to get humanity to the moon and then Mars.\n\n\"What a show it has been,\" SpaceX launch commentator Kate Tice said from Mission Control at company headquarters in California.\n\nSpaceX came close to avoiding explosions in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (meters).\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable. That's why SpaceX wants to control the booster's entry into the gulf and the spacecraft's descent into the Indian Ocean -- it's intended as practice for planned future landings. Nothing is being recovered from Thursday's flight.\n\nNASA has ordered a pair of Starships for two moon-landing missions by astronauts, on tap for later this decade. Each moon crew will rely on NASA's own rocket and capsule to leave Earth, but meet up with Starship in lunar orbit for the ride down to the surface.\n\nSpaceX already is selling tourist trips around the moon. The first private lunar customer, a Japanese tycoon, pulled out of the trip with his entourage last week, citing the oft-delayed schedule.\n\nSpaceX's founder and CEO has grander plans: Musk envisions fleets of Starships launching people and the infrastructure necessary to build a city on Mars.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

The ascent appeared to go as planned other than the failure of one of 33 Raptor engines in the Super Heavy booster to ignite.\n\nAfter \"hot staging\" stage separation, where the Starship upper stage ignites its engines before separating from Super Heavy, the Super Heavy booster performed a boostback burn without any Raptor engine failures, as was the case on two previous flights. It the jettisoned the hot staging interstage section, a new step for this launch that SpaceX says is a temporary measure to reduce the mass of the booster for its landing.\n\nDuring the booster's final phase of descent, it reignited three Raptor engines for a landing burn. This allowed the booster to make a \"landing\" in the Gulf of Mexico, reducing its velocity to zero at the ocean surface before toppling over. Achieving that landing was a major priority for the mission.\n\nStarship flew its planned suborbital trajectory, not exhibiting the rolling seen on the previous launch in March. Starship provided live video during reentry through SpaceX's Starlink satellites, offering dramatic views of the plasma field enveloping the spacecraft.\n\nStarship made it through the maximum phase of heating, unlike the March flight, although video showed damage to one flap. The vehicle continued a controlled descent and performed a landing burn before splashing down about 65 minutes after liftoff.\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" said Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, on social media.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson also praised the flight as a step towards development of a lunar lander version of Starship that the agency plans to use for its Artemis lunar exploration campaign. \"Congratulations SpaceX on Starship's successful test flight this morning!\" he posted. \"We are another step closer to returning humanity to the Moon through Artemis -- then looking onward to Mars.\"\n\nThe launch took place two days after the Federal Aviation Administration issues an updated launch license for Starship. The updated license made no major changes in how SpaceX would conduct the launch but was needed for SpaceX to proceed with the mission.\n\nThe FAA, though, did approve a series of exceptions proposed by SpaceX that could speed up the time before its next flight. The \"test induced damage exceptions\" would allow SpaceX to skip an investigation if they contributed to the loss of the vehicle in the flight provided they did not affect public safety.\n\nThe FAA approved three such exceptions: failure of the vehicle's thermal protection system during the Starship reentry, failure of the vehicle's flaps to provide sufficient control during reentry and failure of the Raptor engines during the landing burn. The FAA said that if any of those failures occur, an investigation will not be required provided it does not result in casualties or third-party property damage, or debris outside of approved hazard areas.\n\nThe same day as the FAA issued a new launch license, an environmental group announced its intent to sue SpaceX, alleging its ground systems were causing water contamination.,\n\nSaveRGV, a group focused on the environment of the Rio Grande Valley region of Texas, announced June 4 that it informed SpaceX it would file suit against the company, claiming \"ongoing violations of federal law,\" specifically the Clean Water Act.\n\nSaveRGV says that the water deluge system that SpaceX installed at Starbase, intended to limit damage to the pad during Starship launches, discharges \"industrial wastewater\" that includes contaminants like metals that can travel as far as one kilometer from the pad. SpaceX lacks a permit for such discharges from Texas state regulators, the organization says.\n\nAn environmental review conducted by the FAA before the second Starship/Super Heavy launch in November concluded that the additional of the water deluge system resulted in no significant environmental changes. The review concluded that the water from the deluge system \"is expected to be less than an average summer rainfall event\" and \"would be unlikely to alter water quality.\"\n\nThe organization said it will file suit against SpaceX within 60 days, seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief that could prohibit SpaceX from using the deluge system or even performing launches there.", "source": {"uri": "spacenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_foust@spacenews.com", "name": "Jeff Foust", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artemis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_landing_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soft landing (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_lander", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lunar lander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9_first-stage_landing_tests", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falcon 9 first-stage landing tests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Commercial_Space_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Office of Commercial Space Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-orbital_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sub-orbital spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_the_Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exploration of the Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Engineering", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/starship-ift4-liftoff.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 94, "textEnd": 100}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 3544, "textEnd": 3550}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

"body": "SpaceX's fourth test flight of its deep-space rocket Starship was its most successful so far, with the booster and spacecraft sent to space and brought back safely.\n\nStarship, a powerful rocket being developed to carry humans to the Moon and Mars, took off from Boca Chica beach in Brownsville, Texas, just before 5pm on Thursday.\n\nSpaceX achieved several milestones in this launch, including the successful splashdown of the Super Heavy Booster in the Indian Ocean just after 5pm, as well as a re-entry and splashdown of the Starship spacecraft.\n\n\"Congratulations SpaceX on Starship's successful test flight this morning!\" Nasa administrator Bill Nelson posted on X shortly after the soft touchdown.\n\n\"We are another step closer to returning humanity to the Moon through Artemis - then looking onward to Mars.\"\n\nThe progress was crucial for the company, which has been trying to develop the powerful rocket for many years.\n\nIt has a $2.89 billion contract with Nasa that involves using Starship for the Artemis 3 mission, aimed at taking astronauts to the Moon in 2026.\n\nJapanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa had purchased seats as part of his dearMoon project, in which he would have taken eight artists around the Moon with him.\n\nBut, last week, he announced that he was cancelling the project, saying he thought Starship would be launch-ready by 2023.\n\nIn the previous test, the Starship spacecraft reached orbit for the first time, but failed to complete a splashdown.\n\nThis time, however, the craft survived re-entry, despite experiencing temperatures of 1,400\u00b0C.\n\nThe live broadcast by SpaceX, which was watched by more than 2 million people, showed that the craft was being torn apart by the plasma of the planet.\n\n\"It's holding on by bolts and threads,\" the narrator said during the stream.\n\nThe spacecraft still managed to carry out a landing burn and perform a soft touchdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe booster also carried out a successful flip manoeuvre, in which it turned the other way around so it could perform a landing burn, before splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWhile a splashdown of the booster was intentional during the test flight, it is hoped the booster will one-day carry out a surface landing so it can be reusable.\n\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk is also working with US billionaire Jared Isaacman, who is leading the Polaris programme, on a series of privately led space missions aboard Falcon 9 and Starship.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"},

The Integrated Flight Test 4 or IFT4 is targeted for lift off at 5:50 pm IST, according to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. For the fourth time, the mega rocket will lift off from Boca Chica, Texas with the ambition of surviving re-entry - the point where flight 3 failed on March 14.\n\nSpaceX got a launch approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on June 5, clearing the last hurdle in Starship flight.\n\nWhere to watch the launch live?\n\nAccording to SpaceX, a live webcast of the launch will begin about a hour prior to the lift off. You can tune in to SpaceX's profile on X or its website at 5 pm. Multiple YouTube channels like NASA Spaceflight and Everyday Astronaut will also stream the launch.\n\nALSO SEE: Starship Is Launching Again On June 6; What Is Different This Time?\n\nStarship's objective for flight 4\n\nSpaceX has said that the primary objective of the mission will be executing a soft splashdown of Starship's Super Heavy Booster in the Gulf Of Mexico and achieving a controlled re-entry of the upper stage Ship.\n\nThe company has made software and hardware upgrades in Starship for the recovery of the rocket. Lessons learnt from the largely successful flight 3 have also been implemented in the upcoming mission.\n\nAs for the trajectory, it will be the same as the third mission. The Super Heavy Booster will fall into the Gulf Of Mexico after lifting off, and the upper stage Ship will proceed to orbit after separation from the Booster.\n\nIt will then re-enter the atmosphere for a splashdown in the Indian Ocean. SpaceX will look to test the Ship's heatshield tiles which are supposed to protect the rocket from overheating.\n\nReusability and durability of Starship is what SpaceX is chasing as it has been picked by NASA for missions to the Moon. However, the rocket has failed to meet the deadlines in terms of its development by a few years. It has led to cancellation of the private 'dearMoon' mission and the potential delay of Artemis 3.\n\nALSO SEE: Elon Musk Predicts Starship Will Be On Mars 'Within Five Years' After Successful Test Flight\n\n(Image: SpaceX)", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Dodd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Dodd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DearMoon_project", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DearMoon project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artemis 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/seo/7/74142/74142_sd5b.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 327, "textEnd": 335}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 417, "textEnd": 423}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 808, "textEnd": 814}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

This capability is essential for future uses, such as NASA's Artemis lunar lander and SpaceX's interplanetary travel ambitions.\n\nWith so much riding on this fourth test flight, a smooth launch and successful data-gathering re-entry could pave the way for Starship to soon attempt its first orbital mission around Earth.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbital spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_lander", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lunar lander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iterative and incremental development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Test_and_Measurement", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Test and Measurement", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/starship-super-heavy-054433479-16x9_1.jpeg?VersionId=mzHrFdAUgYO9aNstSjp1nEBF_X5vUF.k", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nStarship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever developed and stands at around 400 feet tall. It is a key component to Elon Musk and SpaceX's ambition of ferrying cargo, and eventually humans, to the moon, Mars and beyond and the rocket is slated to play a key role in NASA's plans to return American astronauts to the moon. Core to achieving this vision, and the broader development of the space economy, is reusability. Historically, space has largely been the purview of wealthy nation states as it is so prohibitively expensive to get there, largely due to the fact rockets have been used as a disposable resource. Musk's SpaceX is at the forefront of changing this and has already seen success in this area with its smaller rockets and is hoping to replicate this with Starship, which SpaceX has said will one day be able to \"carry up to 100 people on long-duration, interplanetary flights,\" help deliver satellites and enable \"the development of a moon base.\" While each of the three previous Starship tests have ended in flames or crashes -- the first damaged the launch pad when it exploded seconds after launch, the second blew up shortly after separation, which the company described as \"a rapid unscheduled disassembly,\" and the third crashed into the Indian Ocean -- the company has hailed them successes and improved the rocket based on what it learnt. \"The fourth flight of Starship will aim to bring us closer to the rapidly reusable future on the horizon,\" SpaceX said. \"We're continuing to rapidly develop Starship, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as quickly as possible as we build a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and beyond.\"\n\nThe main goal of the fourth Starship test flight is \"getting through max reentry heating,\" Musk said on X, formerly Twitter. The billionaire said it is \"worth noting that no one has ever succeeded in creating a fully reusable heat shield.\" Musk said developing a \"reusable orbital return heat shield,\" technology vital to protect the rocket when it returns to Earth through the atmosphere, has never been done before and is SpaceX's \"biggest remaining problem.\" Musk said that with \"extreme effort,\" SpaceX could bring Starship reusability to around 100%.\n\nFor around a decade, SpaceX has been in competition with Boeing to develop a space taxi service for astronauts as NASA works to build out the industry and boost its options for getting people into space. Though SpaceX has been regularly shuttling astronauts for NASA and other organizations into space for years, Boeing has endured years of delays and struggles. On Wednesday, it finally launched its first crewed test of its Starliner rocket, which is carrying two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_the_Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colonization of the Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interplanetary spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geocentric orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6659c0eacaa3c89097c832a7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=5453,3066,x0,y142,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Credit: X\n\nSpaceX conducted its latest Starship test launch at 8:50AM EST on June 6, the fourth of such launches for the company and the first to achieve a successful controlled splashdown of its first-stage Super Heavy booster.\n\nThe 15-story-tall Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, and consists of two stages -- a Super Heavy booster and the \"Ship\" module. The Super Heavy's 33 methane- and liquid-oxygen fueled Raptor engines collectively generate 16.7 million pounds of thrust. SpaceX says the second-stage Ship is ultimately meant to accommodate as many as 100 crewmembers on voyages to the moon and Mars, if all goes according to plan.\n\nThursday's launch was the fourth uncrewed attempt from SpaceX -- each one advancing slightly further in the overall goal of successfully relanding the Starship rocket. The company's first test in April 2023 lasted only four minutes before SpaceX ground controllers triggered a controlled detonation after Starship's two stages failed to separate. The company nearly doubled their flight time in November 2023 and its most recent attempt in March managed to survive roughly 50 minutes before breaking up during atmospheric reentry.\n\n[Related: SpaceX Starships keep exploding, but it's all part of Elon Musk's plan.]\n\nLike the previous test, the aim is for Ship to make a splashdown in the Indian Ocean while the Super Heavy booster has already dropped into the Gulf of Mexico near the SpaceX Starbase.\n\nStarship's reliability is key to NASA's ongoing Artemis lunar program meant to pave the way for establishing a permanent human presence on the moon's surface by the end of the decade. SpaceX is slated to provide a fully relaunchable Starship for the crewed Artemis 3 mission currently scheduled for September 2026.\n\nStarship launches have not been without controversy. SpaceX's April 2023 launch was described as \"truly terrifying\" by residents near the launchsite in Boca Chica, Texas, as it caused a \"mini earthquake\" while generating a 25-feet-deep crater. \"Virtually everywhere\" was covered with fine dust and sand grain in Port Isabel, and bowling ball-sized debris careened into an empty NASA van. Environmental advocates have also repeatedly voiced concerns about the effects of launches on nearby protected wildlife refuge areas.

A notice from the company warned residents near SpaceX's Boca Chica launch site in Texas that they might hear \"a loud noise resulting from the rocket's 33 Raptor engines firing upon ignition.\"\n\nSpaceX will broadcast the launch live on X.\n\nHere's what else you need to know about this latest test flight.\n\nStanding nearly 400 feet tall when stacked on top of its \"Super Heavy\" booster, Starship is larger than even the Saturn V rockets that carried the Apollo astronauts to the moon. The spaceship is also unique in that it uses stainless steel instead of light-weight metals like aluminum and titanium.\n\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk wants Starship to one day carry astronauts to Mars. NASA has also given the company billions to develop it into a lunar lander, as part of its Artemis program to return astronauts to the moon. Finally, Starship is expected to play a pivotal role in the expansion of SpaceX's Starlink satellite network, by allowing the company to launch large numbers of internet-capable satellites all at once.\n\nTo achieve those lofty goals, Starship has to first prove it can work as intended. Its stainless steel body is supposed to make it rugged and rapidly reusable, and that is key to its many missions. The rocket's Raptor engines must also be able to fire and relight at different points in the flight.\n\nStarship's first test launch in April of 2023 ended with the entire rocket exploding over the Gulf of Mexico. Its second test flight ended after the spacecraft triggered its self-destruct system before reaching orbit.\n\nBut by test flight three, Starliner was behaving more like an actual spacecraft. It successfully reached its expected orbit, and cruised part way around the world.\n\nBut there were still plenty of problems. A cargo door didn't appear to open properly. And the Starship tumbled as it began to re-enter earth's atmosphere. SpaceX believes clogged valves prevented the roll-control thrusters from working properly. The superheated gasses around the vehicle eventually caused it to disintegrate somewhere over the Indian Ocean.\n\nMeanwhile the super-heavy booster also had issues. Its engines failed to re-light properly as it reentered the atmosphere and fell back towards earth. It broke apart above the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSpaceX says that it has made several modifications to the Starship in preparation for its fourth launch. They've added extra roll-control thrusters to keep it from tumbling. They've also made modifications to help the super-heavy booster more reliably relight its engines.\n\nAssuming those upgrades work, all eyes will be on Starship's heat shield. Heat tiles have been seen falling off during earlier launches, and on X, Elon Musk admitted that even a single missing tile could cause the ship to burn up in the atmosphere.\n\nIf the heat shield can work, the spacecraft will make a controlled re-entry and attempt a soft landing in the Indian Ocean.\n\nBut the spacecraft is still very much experimental. On its website, SpaceX promises only \"An exciting landing!\"", "source": {"uri": "weku.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "weku.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stainless steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saturn V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Titanium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artemis program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Pyrotechnics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Pyrotechnics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ea17426/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6879x3611+0+774/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F6879x5159%20430%200%2Fresize%2F6879x5159%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F02%2F5d%2F2c911f8847d880e1f31ef9eaf586%2Fap24157475469369.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Ground teams whooped and hollered as the upper stage glowed a fiery red during its descent, in footage relayed by SpaceX's Starlink satellite network.\n\nA piece of flying debris even cracked the camera lens, but the ship ultimately stuck the landing.\n\n\"Congratulations SpaceX on Starship's successful test flight this morning!\" NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on X. \"We are another step closer to returning humanity to the Moon through #Artemis -- then looking onward to Mars.\"\n\n- Twice as powerful as Saturn V -\n\nDesigned to eventually be fully reusable, Starship stands 397 feet (121 meters) tall with both stages combined -- 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty.\n\nIts Super Heavy booster produces 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rockets used during the Apollo missions -- though later versions should be more powerful still.\n\nSpaceX's strategy of carrying out tests in the real world rather than in labs has paid off in the past.\n\nIts Falcon 9 rockets have come to be workhorses for NASA and the commercial sector, its Dragon capsule sends astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, and its Starlink internet satellite constellation now covers dozens of countries.\n\nBut the clock is ticking for SpaceX to be ready for NASA's planned return of astronauts to the Moon in 2026, using a modified Starship as the final vehicle to take astronauts from orbit down to the surface.\n\nTo accomplish this, SpaceX will need to first place a primary Starship in orbit, then use multiple \"Starship tankers\" to fill it up with supercooled fuel for the onward journey -- a complex engineering feat that has never before been accomplished.\n\nAt least one SpaceX fan has grown tired of waiting. Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa announced this week he has canceled a planned trip around the Moon on Starship with a crew of artists, because he has no idea when it might actually happen.\n\nia/st\n\nMore from this section\n\nImaget v2.0.0 Released: Bulk Download Images from URL List\n\nA Legacy of Excellence: HMF Express Marks 35 Years of Custom, Quick Ship Hollow Metal Doors

The rocket's fin started ripping off mid-fall, and the camera lens cracked. Starship's splashdown was a big step toward reusability though, and Elon Musk claimed victory.\n\nSpaceX's Starship mega-rocket snagged a huge victory on the road to Elon Musk's Mars-settling plans on Thursday -- but not without some battle scars.\n\nFor the first time ever, the rocket ship flew to space and returned to Earth to splash into the Indian Ocean, with its engines firing and communications with mission control intact.\n\nHowever, the spacecraft was visibly falling apart on SpaceX's livestream as it screamed through Earth's atmosphere.\n\nViewers had a limited view of the ship itself, but the onboard camera was conveniently positioned right in front of a fin that started ripping off about halfway through the plummet back to Earth.\n\nSoon the spacecraft was shedding so much debris that it clouded the camera. Eventually, according to a SpaceX commentator on the livestream, the lens cracked under the extreme conditions.\n\nStill, Starship at least partially accomplished one of its biggest goals for this flight: to practice landing.\n\nSpaceX operators confirmed that as Starship neared the water, it fired its engines in an attempt to flip itself upright and lower itself to a soft landing.\n\nYou can watch the whole ordeal on SpaceX's livestream, starting at 1 hour and 25 minutes:\n\nMusk claimed victory, posting on X: \"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean! Congratulations @SpaceX team on an epic achievement!!\"\n\nGiven the damage to the spacecraft, and the poor visibility from the camera recording, it was not immediately clear how soft the landing really was.\n\nThe full extent of the damage to Starship was not immediately clear either, and it may never be, since SpaceX does not plan to recover the ship from the ocean.\n\nFalling back to Earth is extremely intense\n\nThe shredding was a sight to behold, but it wasn't a surprise. This was a test flight, after all, and SpaceX only guaranteed excitement.\n\nSpaceflight is hard, but the return trip to Earth is downright hellish.\n\nA \"reentering\" spacecraft screams toward Earth at many times the speed of sound -- 17,000 mph for Starship, according to SpaceX -- pushing through an increasingly thick atmosphere and building up so much friction that ultra-heated plasma forms around its belly, lashing the spaceship with temperatures up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThat plasma showed up on the livestream too.\n\nThat's why any spacecraft designed to come back to Earth must have a decent heat shield. For Starship, that's its belly of 18,000 hexagon-shaped ceramic tiles, which Musk has hinted is still a work in progress.\n\n\"A super reliable, light, reusable heat shield is the biggest technical challenge remaining for Starship,\" Musk wrote on X in May.\n\nAfter Thursday's flight, he reiterated that the heat shield was \"the single toughest problem remaining.\"\n\nThough this was the launch system's fourth test flight, it's only the second time Starship has actually reached space.\n\nThe first time, in March, SpaceX declared the vehicle \"lost\" after it dropped out of communications on the way back down. That probably means it disintegrated or blew up from the stress of reentering Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe Starship-Super Heavy launch system -- consisting of the lower-stage Super Heavy booster and upper-stage Starship vehicle -- promises to be the largest, most powerful, and first-ever fully reusable orbital rocket on Earth.\n\nStarship's landing was a big step toward reusability. The Super Heavy booster also practiced and successfully achieved its first soft water landing, after it separated from Starship on Thursday.\n\nThe booster fired its engines and flipped itself upright to lower into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nEventually, SpaceX plans to land both stages of the rocket on solid ground to be rapidly refurbished and flown again another day.\n\nIf it lives up to its hype, Starship-Super Heavy could slash the cost of spaceflight tenfold, conduct point-to-point high-speed transport on Earth, and, yes, even bring the first colonists to Mars.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "morgan_mcfall_johnsen@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Morgan McFall-Johnsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_landing_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soft landing (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_control_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mission control center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speed of sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stress (mechanics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceramic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Flat_Earth", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Flat Earth", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Education", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Academic Departments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6661e19b1cd3b1779043ef6c?format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Video from the vehicle indicated it was falling apart at the end, but still operating.\"Splashdown confirmed! Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting fourth flight test of Starship!\" the company said on X.Earlier in the flight, the booster part of the rocket was brought back down to the Gulf of Mexico, to hover just above the water.That's also a big step forward from previous test flights when the booster was destroyed in flight.This was the fourth test flight in SpaceX's Starship development programme, and by far the most consequential.It sets the company up to make further, rapid progress.\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!

To put that in context, the US space agency's (Nasa) biggest rocket - the Space Launch System, or SLS - produces 39 meganewtons off the pad, and that's over 20% more than the old space shuttle system could generate.If SpaceX engineers can perfect Starship, it will be revolutionary.It's intended to be fully and rapidly reusable, to operate much like an aeroplane that can be refuelled and put back in the air in quick ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_landing_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soft landing (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newton (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Launch System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thrust"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 52}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Here is everything you need to know.\n\nThe launch looks likely to take place today, pending regulatory approval - each flight must be signed off by the US Federal Aviation Administration. SpaceX says on its Twitter feed that a livestream will begin at 12.30pm UK time.\n\nJudge Eddie Trevi\u00f1o in Cameron county, Texas, which is home to SpaceX's Starbase launch site, has issued orders for nearby roads to be closed. In official documents Trevi\u00f1o had said specifically that these closures are for \"flight testing\", setting out a window of 14 hours between midnight and 1400 local time.\n\nThe fourth flight test will focus on getting Starship back from orbit and carrying out a mock landing of both it and the Super Heavy first-stage booster. A touchdown on land is currently deemed too risky, so both vehicles will make a \"soft splashdown\" into the ocean. They will use their engines to slow their descent, line up as if they were landing back at base, and gently plop into the water. The first-stage booster is due to land around 7 minutes after lift-off in the Gulf of Mexico, not far from the launch site, while Starship will aim for splashdown in the Indian Ocean around an hour later.\n\nThere have been three Starship launches, all ending in explosions, although that is an expected part of SpaceX's fail-fast, learn-fast strategy.\n\nThe first launch on 20 April last year saw three engines on the first stage - from a total of 33 - fail to ignite. Several more subsequently failed during the flight. The rocket then span out of control, causing a self-destruct safeguard to kick in. The whole flight lasted around 3 minutes and reached a maximum altitude of 39 kilometres.\n\nStarship's second launch was on 18 November. This time, all 33 engines fired and the rocket flew long enough for the first and second stages to separate. But, as the first stage rotated to begin its slowdown and landing procedure, it exploded. The second stage successfully continued to an altitude of about 149 kilometres, passing the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line that marks the beginning of space. However, a safeguard feature destroyed it when it stopped sending back data, before it had a chance to complete an orbit or make its way back to Earth.\n\nSpaceX's third Starship test flight on 14 March was at least a partial success as it reached space, carried out fuel transfer tests and travelled further and faster than ever before. But the craft failed to make its scheduled soft landing after losing attitude control mid-flight. Despite this, it achieved a number of key milestones, such the first Starship re-entry from space, the first ever opening and closing of Starship's payload door in space, and a successful propellant transfer demonstration that will be key to future NASA Artemis missions to the moon.\n\nIt probably will go wrong, in some respect, as Starship is highly unlikely to complete its mission flawlessly. But any failure will supply data and experience that can be used to improve the design and processes for the fifth launch. SpaceX has shown that it can iterate rapidly and make significant progress with every launch.", "source": {"uri": "newscientist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Scientist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Altitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_propellant_depot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbital propellant depot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_attitude_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft attitude control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artemis program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_landing_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soft landing (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payload"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00e1rm\u00e1n_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/05102846/sei207439173.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-20", "textStart": 1446, "textEnd": 1454}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-18", "textStart": 1799, "textEnd": 1810}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 2344, "textEnd": 2352}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Minutes after Thursday morning's liftoff, the first-stage booster separated from the spacecraft and splashed into the gulf precisely as planned, after firing its engines.\n\n\"And we have splashdown!\" SpaceX launch commentator Kate Tice announced from Mission Control at company headquarters in California.\n\nIt was a critical milestone in the company's plan to eventually return Starship's Super Heavy booster to its launch site for reuse.\n\nSpaceX came close to avoiding explosion in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (meters).\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable. That's why SpaceX wants to control the booster's entry into the gulf and the spacecraft's descent into the Indian Ocean - it's intended as practice for planned future landings. Nothing is being recovered from Thursday's flight.\n\nNASA has ordered a pair of Starships for two moon-landing missions by astronauts, on tap for later this decade. Each moon crew will rely on NASA's own rocket and capsule to leave Earth, but meet up with Starship in lunar orbit for the ride down to the surface.\n\nSpaceX already is selling tourist trips around the moon. The first private lunar customer, a Japanese tycoon, pulled out of the trip with his entourage last week, citing the oft-delayed schedule.\n\nSpaceX's founder and CEO has grander plans: Musk envisions fleets of Starships launching people and the infrastructure necessary to build a city on Mars.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_control_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mission control center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lunar orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Explosives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Explosives", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-110773361,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-68608,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The rocket, the most powerful ever built, is designed to eventually send astronauts to the moon and to Mars.\n\nThe goal of Thursday's uncrewed test flight of Starship is to have the spacecraft and its rocket return to Earth in controlled descents -- the capsule in the Indian Ocean and the rocket in the Gulf of Mexico -- but there were no plans to recover the stages.\n\nIn future flights, Elon Musk's Hawthorne-based company is expected to attempt landings on pads so the spacecraft and rocket can be reused, an essential technology to making space flight cheaper.\n\nThe space-launch system, at 397 feet, is taller and has about twice the thrust of the Saturn 5 and Apollo capsule that carried men to the moon. It is collectively referred to as Starship.\n\nThis was the second major launch this week and came after Boeing on Wednesday finally launched its Starliner spacecraft with a crew aboard to the International Space Station. Starliner, which has had its launches repeatedly delayed, is competing to service the station with SpaceX, which already has sent more than half a dozen crews to the orbiting lab. Starliner is expected to dock with the station at 9:15 a.m. Thursday.\n\nThursday's flight came about four months after a March 14 test flight when Starship reached several milestones. However, the capsule burned up in the atmosphere on descent while the rocket failed to achieve a controlled reentry to earth.\n\nStarship did reach orbit, though, opened and closed its payload doors and transferred fuel from one tank to another, a critical function for flights into space. The test flight also was the longest yet of the spacecraft.\n\nThe craft's first flight in April 2023 lasted only a few minutes before the booster lost power and exploded on ascent. A second launch in November was more successful, with the rocket separating from the capsule before both were lost.\n\nSpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp., views flight failures as part of its development process, an approach that differs from traditional aerospace companies that have long preferred to perfect their technology on the ground.\n\nStarship is part of NASA's Artemis program to return humans to the moon, with the goal of establishing a permanent base to facilitate missions to Mars. The program includes a second spacecraft called Orion, manufactured by NASA, Northrop Grumman and Airbus, and a Space Launch System rocket built by Boeing, Northrop Grumman and other companies.\n\nOrion circled the moon in a successful 25-day mission that blasted off in November 2022 without a crew. A mission carrying astronauts is scheduled for no earlier than September 2025.\n\nStarship also has a commercial component. It would allow the privately held company to launch more and larger Starlink broadband satellites than the company's existing lineup of Falcon 9 rockets.\n\nLast week, Japanese e-commerce billionaire Yusaku Maezawa tweeted that he had pulled out of a contract signed in 2018 to fly in Starship around the moon due to delays in the spacecraft's development. Maezawa, who wanted to fly with a half dozen artists, said he had expected the private space trip to take place in 2023.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Payload"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saturn V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusaku_Maezawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yusaku Maezawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northrop Grumman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/516316f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7826x4402+0+407/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff3%2F48%2Fa7a9f00447b183ec41149aa06420%2Fspacex-starship-99742.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 1518, "textEnd": 1526}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

This time, both managed to splash down in a controlled fashion.\n\nThe world's largest and most powerful rocket -- almost 400 feet (121 meters) tall -- was empty as it soared above the Gulf of Mexico and headed east on a flight to the Indian Ocean.\n\nMinutes after Thursday morning's liftoff, the first-stage booster separated from the spacecraft and splashed into the gulf precisely as planned, after firing its engines.\n\nAn hour later, live views showed parts of the spacecraft breaking away during the intense heat of reentry, but it remained intact enough to transmit data all the way to its targeted splashdown site in the Indian Ocean.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nSpaceX's mega Starship rocket blasted off from Texas on Thursday, the fourth test flight for the spaceship that NASA and Elon Musk are counting on to get humanity to the moon and Mars.\n\nThe world's largest and most powerful rocket -- almost 400 feet (121 meters) tall -- was empty as it soared above the Gulf of Mexico and headed east on a planned hourlong flight. The spacecraft on top was aiming for a half-lap around the planet with a splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\n[Boeing's space capsule springs more helium leaks on its first flight with astronauts]\n\nSpaceX was looking to avoid explosions this time by controlling the descents. Minutes after Thursday morning's liftoff, the first-stage booster separated from the spacecraft and splashed into the gulf precisely as planned, after firing its engines.\n\n\"And we have splashdown!\" SpaceX launch commentator Kate Tice announced from Mission Control at company headquarters in California.\n\nIt was a critical milestone in the company's plan to eventually return Starship's Super Heavy booster to its launch site for reuse.\n\nSpaceX came close to avoiding explosion in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (meters).\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable. That's why SpaceX wants to control the booster's entry into the gulf and the spacecraft's descent into the Indian Ocean -- it's intended as practice for planned future landings. Nothing is being recovered from Thursday's flight.\n\nNASA has ordered a pair of Starships for two moon-landing missions by astronauts, on tap for later this decade. Each moon crew will rely on NASA's own rocket and capsule to leave Earth, but meet up with Starship in lunar orbit for the ride down to the surface.\n\nSpaceX already is selling tourist trips around the moon. The first private lunar customer, a Japanese tycoon, pulled out of the trip with his entourage last week, citing the oft-delayed schedule.\n\nSpaceX's founder and CEO has grander plans: Musk envisions fleets of Starships launching people and the infrastructure necessary to build a city on Mars.", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_control_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mission control center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lunar orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Explosives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Explosives", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.adn.com/resizer//GbBz92hoJkyMxzKl72I_gm92JSg=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/OEPXVJ6IXIWC7GJTMI5UOMTPRY.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nViewers had a limited view of the ship itself, but the onboard camera was conveniently positioned right in front of a fin that started ripping off about halfway through the plummet back to Earth.\n\nSoon the spacecraft was shedding so much debris that it clouded the camera. Eventually, according to a SpaceX commentator on the livestream, the lens cracked under the extreme conditions.\n\nStill, Starship at least partially accomplished one of its biggest goals for this flight: to practice landing.\n\nSpaceX operators confirmed that as Starship neared the water, it fired its engines in an attempt to flip itself upright and lower itself to a soft landing.\n\nYou can watch the whole ordeal on SpaceX's livestream, starting at 1 hour and 25 minutes:\n\nMusk claimed victory, posting on X: \"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean! Congratulations @SpaceX team on an epic achievement!!\"\n\nGiven the damage to the spacecraft, and the poor visibility from the camera recording, it was not immediately clear how soft the landing really was.\n\nThe full extent of the damage to Starship was not immediately clear either, and it may never be, since SpaceX does not plan to recover the ship from the ocean.\n\nThe shredding was a sight to behold, but it wasn't a surprise. This was a test flight, after all, and SpaceX only guaranteed excitement.\n\nSpaceflight is hard, but the return trip to Earth is downright hellish.\n\nA \"reentering\" spacecraft screams toward Earth at many times the speed of sound -- 17,000 mph for Starship, according to SpaceX -- pushing through an increasingly thick atmosphere and building up so much friction that ultra-heated plasma forms around its belly, lashing the spaceship with temperatures up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThat plasma showed up on the livestream too.\n\nThat's why any spacecraft designed to come back to Earth must have a decent heat shield. For Starship, that's its belly of 18,000 hexagon-shaped ceramic tiles, which Musk has hinted is still a work in progress.\n\n\"A super reliable, light, reusable heat shield is the biggest technical challenge remaining for Starship,\" Musk wrote on X in May.\n\nAfter Thursday's flight, he reiterated that the heat shield was \"the single toughest problem remaining.\"\n\nThough this was the launch system's fourth test flight, it's only the second time Starship has actually reached space.\n\nThe first time, in March, SpaceX declared the vehicle \"lost\" after it dropped out of communications on the way back down. That probably means it disintegrated or blew up from the stress of reentering Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe Starship-Super Heavy launch system -- consisting of the lower-stage Super Heavy booster and upper-stage Starship vehicle -- promises to be the largest, most powerful, and first-ever fully reusable orbital rocket on Earth.\n\nStarship's landing was a big step toward reusability. The Super Heavy booster also practiced and successfully achieved its first soft water landing, after it separated from Starship on Thursday.\n\nThe booster fired its engines and flipped itself upright to lower into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nEventually, SpaceX plans to land both stages of the rocket on solid ground to be rapidly refurbished and flown again another day.\n\nIf it lives up to its hype, Starship-Super Heavy could slash the cost of spaceflight tenfold, conduct point-to-point high-speed transport on Earth, and, yes, even bring the first colonists to Mars.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "morgan_mcfall_johnsen@businessinsider.com", "name": "Morgan McFall-Johnsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_landing_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soft landing (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Friction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speed of sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stress (mechanics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceramic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Education", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Academic Departments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Undeveloped_or_Vacant", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Undeveloped or Vacant", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6661e0c81cd3b1779043eeb1?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (meters).\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable. That's why SpaceX wants to control the booster's entry into the gulf and the spacecraft's descent into the Indian Ocean -- it's intended as practice for planned future landings. Nothing is being recovered from Thursday's flight.\n\nNASA has ordered a pair of Starships for two moon-landing missions by astronauts, on tap for later this decade.

The spacecraft on top was aiming for a half-lap around the planet with a splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nSpaceX was looking to avoid explosions this time by controlling the descents. Minutes after Thursday morning's liftoff, the first-stage booster separated from the spacecraft and splashed into the gulf precisely as planned, after firing its engines.\n\n\"And we have splashdown!\" SpaceX launch commentator Kate Tice announced from Mission Control at company headquarters in California.\n\nIt was a critical milestone in the company's plan to eventually return Starship's Super Heavy booster to its launch site for reuse.\n\nSpaceX came close to avoiding explosion in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (meters).\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable. That's why SpaceX wants to control the booster's entry into the gulf and the spacecraft's descent into the Indian Ocean -- it's intended as practice for planned future landings.

Super Heavy alone plays host to an impressive 33 Raptor engines, which are capable of generating over 16 million pounds of thrust at launch, while Starship itself features a further six raptor engines, three of which are optimized for use in the vacuum of space.\n\nSpaceX hopes that the power, flexibility, and fully re-usable design of the Starship launcher will one day make it a revolutionary force in spaceflight and form a key element in humanity's ongoing mission to return to the Moon, before carving out a path to Mars. However, in order to do that, the Hawthorn-based company will first need to prove that its vehicle can reliably survive launch, ascent, orbital operations, re-entry, and landing.\n\nTo that end, Elon Musk's aerospace company has engaged in an intensive campaign of flight tests orchestrated from SpaceX's Starbase launch site In Boca Chica, Texas. Each of the three prior missions launched to date have resulted in the loss of the Starship spacecrafts in a fiery conflagration, which necessitated the completion of a comprehensive 'mishap investigation' into the cause of the failures before the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would grant a launch licence for the next test.\n\nThis aggressive approach of testing to destruction has netted SpaceX scientists and engineers masses of performance data, which has been used to swiftly iterate on the launcher's design, moving both booster and spacecraft closer to becoming fully operational.\n\nOn its third suborbital outing in March earlier this year the booster was able to successfully push its Starship upper stage to space on a sub-orbital trajectory, before the spacecraft was ultimately lost during its fiery descent back through Earth's atmosphere after losing control of its orientation. The Super Heavy booster also failed to survive the mission, with a number of Raptor engines failing to ignite during a powered water landing attempt.\n\nFor Starship's fourth test flight on June 6, SpaceX shifted its focus away from ascent and towards reusability and survivability through atmospheric re-entry. Survival during this phase of the mission was entirely dependent on the performance of Starship's heat shield, which is made up of a mosaic of honeycomb tiles arrayed along the 'bottom' of the spacecraft, and on other areas where the extreme heat of re-entry will be felt the most.\n\nDuring today's outing, SpaceX engineers intentionally placed a thin heatshield tile on the underside of Starship and removed two others entirely in order to measure how hot the spacecraft would get in these areas if the protective material was absent.\n\nSpaceX has also spent the time following the third test flight making a number of other hardware and software upgrades to both the Super Heavy booster and Starship spacecraft. Among the overhaul were significant changes to the valves feeding the upper stage attitude control thrusters, which were thought to have become partially blocked during the third test, leading to the loss of control.\n\nAt 7:50 a.m. CT on June 6, Super Heavy's host of Raptor engines ignited to challenge Earth's gravity and heave the gargantuan rocket into the morning sky above the Boca Chica launch site, marking the start of SpaceX's fourth Starship test flight.\n\nTwo minutes and 50 seconds into the flight, the Starship upper stage fired a number of its Raptor engines while it was still in contact with the booster - a manoeuvre known as 'hot staging' - in order to push Super Heavy away and ensure a clean separation. Super Heavy went on to perform a boost back burn before performing a spectacular powered soft water landing in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nStarship meanwhile continued to burn its engines for a little less than six minutes, before cutting them to coast to a height of 214 km above Earth's surface, where the improved attitude control elements allowed the spacecraft to retain control over its orientation. All that remained was to let gravity usher in yet another high-stakes atmospheric re-entry.\n\nA little over 45 minutes after launch, Starship's Earth-facing side became visibly wreathed in glowing plasma as the hypersonic spacecraft compressed the thickening atmosphere around it. The entirety of the dramatic descent was streamed in real time by onboard cameras relaying data via Starlink satellites, bar a few losses of signal brought on by the surrounding plasma. Over the course of 20 minutes, viewers watched as Starship's front right control fin was shredded by the intense heat of re-entry, even as the camera lens became cracked and coated in debris.\n\nWith the view obscured, its impossible to know how much of the spacecraft actually survived the tumultuous journey through Earth's atmosphere. However, telemetry from Starship - and glimpses of the valiant actuator fin through the damaged onboard camera - revealed that the spacecraft was seemingly able to ignite its engines to attempt a landing burn upon nearing the surface of the Indian Ocean.\n\nRegardless of the state of the spacecraft, today's mission can only be considered an overwhelming success, and will have provided SpaceX with a wealth of telemetry and heat shield performance data that will help engineers iterate on Starship's design to help prepare for its fifth test flight, which will almost certainly follow later this year. Space X is also working to construct a second 'Mechazilla' launch tower at its Boca Chica launch facility, and is looking to construct two more towers at Cape Canaveral in Florida, which should help improve the company's launch cadence in the coming years. The current tower is equipped with a set of pincer-like 'arms', which could be used to catch Super Heavy boosters during future precision landings.\n\nMusk revealed in a recent presentation that SpaceX is looking to begin work on six more Starships and Super Heavy boosters this year. Furthermore, the X owner revealed that an orbital Starship re-fuelling demonstration could occur sometime next year, and that he would like to see at least two controlled and accurate ocean landings with the spacecraft before any attempt to perform a Starport landing. An attempt to catch the Super Heavy booster using the Boca Chica launch tower's arms could potentially come even sooner. \"I think we should try to catch the booster with the mechazilla arms next flight,\" commented Musk in an X post in the wake of today's successful test flight.\n\nFor more space news, why not read up on the first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, or discover what it would look like to fall directly into a supermassive black hole, courtesy of a new NASA supercomputer simulation.\n\nImage credit: SpaceX", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-orbital_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sub-orbital spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vacuum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/starship-re-entry-1717688633893.jpg?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 2451, "textEnd": 2457, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

"New Delhi, June 6 (VOICE) Billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX on Thursday successfully launched its fourth test flight.\"Liftoff of Starship!\" SpaceX wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe 400-feet-tall Starship rocket along with the Heavy booster lifted off after 6 p.m. IST from SpaceX's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas on June 6.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday, gave the green signal for the flight after all safety and other licensing requirements for the test were met.\n\nThe huge Starship's raptor engines ignited during hot-staging separation.\n\nFlight 4 used a similar trajectory as the previous test flights and the Starship splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\n\"Super Heavy has splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico,\" the company said.\n\nThe fourth flight test is aimed at inching \"closer to the rapidly reusable future on the horizon\", the company said.\n\nWhile it has so far had three test flights, its reusability remains a concern, as the \"shuttle's heat shield required over 6 months of refurbishment by a large team\", Musk said earlier.\n\n\"Building upon what we achieved during Starship's third flight test, our primary goal today is to get through the extreme heat of reentry,\" the company said.\n\nTo enable this, SpaceX \"intentionally placed one thin heatshield tile and removed two tiles completely from the Ship\".\n\nThis will help measure how hot things get without tiles in those locations, while also testing some thermal protection options.\n\n\"If Starship manages to make it all the way to reentry, we'll collect valuable data on the vehicle at hypersonic speeds, or more than 5x the speed of sound,\" the company noted, prior to the launch.\n\nThe huge Starship vehicle is intended to land astronauts on the Moon during the crewed Artemis 3 mission in 2026, and later to Mars and beyond.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [],

This extreme re-entry testing is a crucial step before Starship can attempt an orbital flight.\n\nDuring the third test launch, while the booster successfully executed a \"boost-back\" burn to reverse course, it experienced an anomaly during the final landing burn, resulting in a hard impact with the ocean surface.

This rocket is meant for the spaceship that NASA and Elon Musk are counting on to get humanity to the moon and Mars.\n\nThe world's largest and most powerful rocket almost 400 feet (121 meters) tall was empty as it soared above the Gulf of Mexico and headed east. The spacecraft on top was aiming for a half-lap around the planet with a splashdown in the Indian Ocean, once it ditched the first-stage booster in the gulf.\n\nThis time, SpaceX was looking to avoid explosions by controlling the descents. SpaceX came close in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (metres).\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable.

The avalanche of air pressure thrown off by a large launch vehicle's engines at liftoff will literally thump you in the chest from a few miles away.\n\nStarship's first stage completed its burn while the second stage's six Raptor engines lit in a hot-staging handoff that was followed by the second stage firing until a shutdown as planned 94 miles up, putting that stage on a suborbital trajectory to a hoped-for landing in the Indian Ocean.\n\nBut first, the booster had to make its way to the Gulf of Mexico intact. And this time, it did, with a series of braking burns allowing the booster to lower itself into the waves, as live video footage showed water splashing around its base.\n\nSpaceX needed three tries to get its Falcon 9 booster to a soft landing in the Atlantic, but the practice it's gained since from hundreds of successful first-stage landings seems to have paid off for Starship.\n\nPeople watching the livestream shared by SpaceX's X account had to wait another half hour to see the figurative and literal fireworks for Starship's second stage.\n\nWhile that vehicle coasted out of coverage above the atmosphere to a peak altitude of about 132 miles, SpaceX instead treated viewers to an apt soundtrack: Strauss's \"The Blue Danube,\" a nod to that waltz's appearance in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nForty-five minutes into the flight, Starship began a risky reentry. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk had suggested it might not survive this in a May 30 X reply that revealed that Starship's 18,000 hexagonal heat-shielding tiles had effectively zero margin for error.\n\n\"Right now, we are not resilient to loss of a single tile in most places, as the secondary containment material will probably not survive,\" he wrote. \"This is a thorny issue indeed, given that vast resources have been applied to solve it, thus far to no avail.\"\n\nStarship's last test flight on March 14 demonstrated that risk when the upper stage lost control and burned up during reentry about 40 miles up. On Thursday's flight, the upper stage escaped that fate but got more than a little cooked on the way down.\n\nThe video streamed via SpaceX's Starlink broadband-satellite constellation showed a glow of plasma building up around the spacecraft as it encountered the first traces of Earth's atmosphere that steadily built up and began changing colors, like an artificial aurora. SpaceX commentators and flight controllers called out its progress through peak heating some 44 miles up.\n\nAt 36 miles up, past the point where Starship had met a fiery end on the last flight, the video showed the skin on one of the vehicle's control flaps peeling off and revealing the framework underneath. Then the camera lens cracked, but speed and altitude telemetry showed Starship remained in a controlled descent.\n\nWith a final braking burn, the vehicle -- or whatever was left of it -- managed to slow to about 6 miles an hour when it reached the water. We very much hope there is drone footage of that moment.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson posted his congratulations on X, sharing SpaceX's video of Starship's first stage touching down in the water: \"We are another step closer to returning humanity to the Moon through #Artemis -- then looking onward to Mars.\"\n\nThe space agency is banking on Starship to help it return astronauts to the Moon as part of its Artemis project, having granted SpaceX a $2.89 billion contract in April 2021 to develop a lunar-landing version of its second stage that will take astronauts from lunar orbit to the Moon's surface and back.\n\n(Last May, the space agency awarded a $3.4 billion lunar lander contract to Blue Origin, the Jeff Bezos-backed space firm that plans to fly its New Glenn heavy-lift rocket later this year. This vehicle-redundancy strategy notched a major accomplishment Wednesday with the successful launch of Boeing's Starliner capsule on its first crewed flight to the International Space Station.)\n\nSpaceX also plans to shift to Starship to deploy larger, third-generation Starlink satellites, and Musk has repeatedly emphasized how this vehicle's massive capacity -- with refueling in orbit, the current design can send more than 110 tons of payload to the Moon -- will allow for human settlement of the Moon and later Mars.\n\nThursday's successful mission represented a big step toward those goals and showed how far SpaceX has progressed since a first test flight last April that ended early with the rocket careening out of control and exploding 24 miles up. The second, on Nov. 18, saw Starship fly through staging but then ended with both stages exploding, the second just before it would have completed its planned burn to reach space.\n\nSpaceX has not announced details about a fifth Starship test flight. But in a post-flight X reply to retired Canadian astronaut and former ISS Commander Chris Hadfield, Musk emphasized that SpaceX's goal is not just getting Starship back to Earth intact and in need of refurbishment like the Space Shuttle, but ready for refueling and relaunch.\n\n\"A fully and immediately reusable orbital heat shield, which (as you know) has never been made before, is the single toughest problem remaining,\" he said. \"Being able to iterate with many ideas on many ships is key to solving this.\"", "source": {"uri": "pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PC Magazine"},

Within minutes, the first-stage booster separated from the spacecraft and splashed into the gulf precisely as planned, after firing its engines.\n\nThe spacecraft reached an altitude of nearly 130 miles (211 kilometers), traveling at more 16,000 mph (26,000 kph), before beginning its descent. Live views showed parts of the spacecraft breaking away during the intense heat of reentry, but a cracked camera lens obscured the images.\n\nThe spacecraft remained intact enough to transmit data all the way to its targeted splashdown site in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt was a critical milestone in the company's plan to eventually reuse the rocket that NASA and Musk are counting on to get humanity to the moon and then Mars.\n\n\"What a show it has been,\" SpaceX launch commentator Kate Tice said from Mission Control at company headquarters in California.\n\nSpaceX came close to avoiding explosions in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (meters).\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable. That's why SpaceX wants to control the booster's entry into the gulf and the spacecraft's descent into the Indian Ocean -- it's intended as practice for planned future landings. Nothing is being recovered from Thursday's flight.\n\nNASA has ordered a pair of Starships for two moon-landing missions by astronauts, on tap for later this decade.

Despite the engine out, the booster still ascended with ease away from the launch mount and broke through the thick fog into clear blue skies with views streamed back to the ground from just above one of the grid fins.\n\nAs Starship climbed, everything continued to operate nominally all the way through the hot staging which saw Super Heavy Booster 11 shut down all but its 3 center Raptor engines as Starship 29 lit its 6 Raptor engines to pull away from the massive booster. As soon as Starship was clear, Booster 11 completed a flip and boostback burn to begin its trip for a planned soft touchdown in the Gulf of Mexico by relighting 10 Raptor engines.\n\nOnce the boostback burn was complete, the hot staging ring was ejected to reduce the overall mass of the booster to help it survive reentry and landing. Future Super Heavy boosters will feature a lighter hot staging ring that will not be ejected. As the booster made its way back, it re-orientated to vertical and began re-entry back through the atmosphere, and unlike the Falcon 9, it does not perform an entry burn.\n\nAt around 7 minutes and 15 seconds into flight, the Super Heavy booster lit 12 out of a planned 13 engines for its landing burn, followed shortly by quite a bit of debris flying by the onboard camera, but it did not affect anything critical as seconds later Booster 11 made a successful splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico before a slow planned tip over into the water.\n\nAs Booster 11 completed the first successful soft landing, Starship 29 fired its six Raptor engines, three sea level and three vacuum, with engine shutoff coming in at eight and a half minutes into flight. The starship then entered a long coast phase as it passed between the Florida Keys and Cuba and transited over the Atlantic Ocean, followed by Africa.\n\nDuring IFT-3, live views were provided for a majority of this portion but due to an unknown issue, cameras didn't come back until just before 37 minutes into the flight. Elon Musk posted on X that they had a data signal the entire time including live views from internal cameras.\n\n45 minutes into the flight, the true test of Starship began as plasma started to build up, but this time, Starship was in the correct orientation, and the heatshield was facing the correct way to give the ship its best chance at survival.\n\nAs Starship descended, plasma build-up increased with callouts from mission control noting rising temperatures on the nose but all within acceptable limits. At just over 54 minutes into the flight, Starship made it further than the third flight test and into unknown territory.\n\n57 minutes into the flight, peak heating had passed but tiles were starting to fall away from the forward flap followed by melting of the lower portion, despite this damage, Starship held strong and in the correct orientation as it descended.\n\nStarship continued its descent and, with significant damage, still made it through to its own landing burn and performed its flip to a vertical orientation and a soft touchdown in the Indian Ocean west of Australia.\n\nEven with the damage inflicted on Starship, it completed all test objectives while providing SpaceX with incredibly valuable data that will be used to make the ship stronger on future test flights. The Starlink antenna also survived the entire flight which ensured this data made it back to mission control.\n\nWith this successful mission complete, SpaceX could launch the 5th flight by mid to late July and possibly even attempt a catch of the Super Heavy booster according to Elon Musk.\n\nCatch a replay of this epic mission below!\n\nHow do you think this flight went overall, and will the fifth flight take place by August?\n\nQuestions or comments?

The spacecraft on top was aiming for a half-lap around the planet with a splashdown in the Indian Ocean, once it ditched the first-stage booster in the gulf.\n\nThis time, SpaceX was looking to avoid explosions by controlling the descents. SpaceX came close in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (meters).\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable. That's why SpaceX wants to control the booster's entry into the gulf and the spacecraft's descent into the Indian Ocean -- it's intended as practice for planned future landings.

The unmanned Starship spacecraft took off from a spaceport belonging to the private space company owned by technology billionaire Elon Musk, SpaceX, in the US state of Texas, as live images showed. A test flight lasting about an hour is planned.\n\nDuring the first test last April, the entire missile system exploded after just a few minutes. During the second test in November, the two stages of the rocket separated and the upper stage continued to fly, but shortly afterwards each exploded separately. During a third test flight last March, Starship reached space for the first time, but it was also unable to complete the journey as hoped. SpaceX always stresses that the goal of tests is to collect data.\n\nThe \"Starship\" - which consists of an approximately 70-meter-long \"Super Heavy\" booster and an approximately 50-meter-long upper stage, also called a \"Starship\" - is intended to enable manned missions to the Moon and Mars.

Starship Makes a Splash in Fourth Flight Test", "body": "SpaceX's Starship earned high marks today in its fourth uncrewed flight test, making significant progress in the development of a launch system that's tasked with putting NASA astronauts on the moon by as early as 2026.\n\nThe Super Heavy booster blasted off from SpaceX's Starbase complex in South Texas at 7:50 a.m. CT (5:50 a.m. PT), rising into the sky with 32 of its 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines blazing. Super Heavy is considered the world's most powerful launch vehicle, with 16.7 million pounds of thrust at liftoff.\n\nMinutes after launch, the rocket's upper stage -- known as the Ship -- separated from the first stage, firing up its own set of six Raptor engines. Meanwhile, Super Heavy flew itself to a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe soft splashdown marked a new achievement for Starship. During the third flight test, which took place in March, only a few of Super Heavy's engines were able to light up again for a crucial landing burn. As a result, the booster hit the water with an uncontrolled splat.\n\nEventually, SpaceX plans to have the Super Heavy booster fly itself back to its base after doing its job.\n\nThe upper stage reached orbital-scale altitudes in excess of 200 kilometers (120 miles), but completing a full orbit wasn't part of today's plan. Instead, SpaceX aimed to have Ship make its own soft splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nStreaming video, relayed via SpaceX's Starlink satellite network, showed the rocket's protective skin glowing with the heat of atmospheric re-entry. Burning debris broke off from one of Ship's control fins, damaging the camera's lens -- but the fuzzy view nevertheless confirmed that the spacecraft successfully hit the mark. That represented another advance over the third test, when the Ship broke up during its descent to the ocean.\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" SpaceX founder Elon Musk exulted in a posting to his X social-media platform.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson added his congratulations on X, and noted that the successful test was a plus for the space agency's Artemis moon program. \"We are another step closer to returning humanity to the moon through Artemis -- then looking onward to Mars,\" he wrote.\n\nA customized version of Ship is slated to serve as the lunar lander for Artemis 3, which would mark the first crewed mission to the moon's surface since Apollo 17 in 1972. That mission is currently scheduled for 2026, but the timing depends in part on whether the Starship system will be ready in time.\n\nSpaceX's uncrewed flight tests are following a step-by-step path to get Starship in shape for a wide variety of missions -- including the deployment of hundreds of Starlink satellites, point-to-point travel between spaceports on Earth, and crewed odysseys to the moon, Mars and beyond.\n\nStarship rockets aren't carrying payloads for these early tests. \"We said it before, we're going to say it 9,000 times: The data is the payload,\" SpaceX commentator Dan Huot said during today's flight test.\n\nBut as the development program proceeds, the envelope for the flight tests will be widened to include multi-orbit operations, payload deployments and precision touchdowns on landing pads. Before today's test, SpaceX and the Federal Aviation Administration worked out an arrangement that's expected to streamline the regulatory process for future flight tests.", "source": {"uri": "universetoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Universe Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alan_boyle@universetoday.com", "name": "Alan Boyle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thrust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artemis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Test_and_Measurement", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Test and Measurement", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Testing_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Testing and Tools", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/240606-starship4-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Since then, Starship has flown twice and shown progress toward becoming a usable rocket each time.\n\nSpaceX said that Thursday's test aimed to prove \"the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,\" the spacecraft's booster, from orbit to Earth. Once it's proven safe and reliable, NASA plans to use Starship as part of its effort to return humans to the moon in the next decade.\n\nThe explicit goal of Starship is to fulfill Elon Musk's desire to colonize Mars. The Starship is the tallest ever built, has the most engines, and is designed to be reusable -- a key feature to enable back-and-forth trips between Mars and Earth. \"We are mapping out a game plan to get a million people to Mars,\" Musk wrote on X in February; he has said multiple times that humanity's future depends on it. But though SpaceX leads the rocket industry and has transformed space travel, planetary scientists told Business Insider that Musk's plans to colonize Mars within a few years were not realistic, plausible, or credible.\n\nSpaceX employees have said that Musk's aggressive deadlines for new products have led to injuries and a cavalier approach to safety. More than 600 SpaceX workers have reportedly been injured since 2014, according to Reuters, with some employees reporting that safety procedures can fall by the wayside. Beyond the workplace, critics also argue that SpaceX's launches could damage the ozone layer and the ocean, especially as the company aims to ramp up the frequency of launches. The company has also been sued by environmental groups claiming the rocket tests are damaging to protected wildlife close to the Texas launch site, although recent federal inspections have not found evidence to support that claim.\n\nElon Musk is not the only high-profile billionaire with space dreams. Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin is also making strides, and Bezos said it's future is the main reason why he resigned as CEO of Amazon. Bezos has had an abiding interest in colonizing space since high school, CNBC noted. But so far, Blue Origin has taken a more cautious approach than SpaceX, aiming to create a prototype of its large New Glenn rocket that will work on its first test, rather than adopting SpaceX's iterative approach. \"I'm very confident there is going to be a launch this year,\" Blue Origin's chief executive told The New York Times in February.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonization of Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Planetary science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Glenn", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iterative and incremental development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ozone layer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Bezos"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AY3wKCMPC5gYKI4ivyQTBg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/semafor_310/3646a48067b4642e8cd9a79576d4607a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The spacecraft on top was aiming for a half-lap around the planet with a splashdown in the Indian Ocean, once it ditched the first-stage booster in the gulf.\n\nThis time, SpaceX was looking to avoid explosions by controlling the descents. SpaceX came close in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (meters).\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable. That's why SpaceX wants to control the booster's entry into the gulf and the spacecraft's descent into the Indian Ocean -- it's intended as practice for planned future landings. Nothing will be recovered from Thursday's flight.\n\nNASA has ordered a pair of Starships for two moon-landing missions by astronauts, on tap for later this decade. Each moon crew will rely on NASA's own rocket and capsule to leave Earth, but meet up with Starship in lunar orbit for the ride down to the surface.\n\nSpaceX already is selling tourist trips around the moon. The first private lunar customer, a Japanese tycoon, pulled out of the trip with his entourage last week, citing the oft-delayed schedule.\n\nSpaceX's founder and CEO has grander plans: Musk envisions fleets of Starships launching people and the infrastructure necessary to build a city on Mars.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

In its first reusable iteration, Starship is expected to be able to carry as much as 150 tonnes into low Earth orbit, more than twice the capacity of Falcon 9.\n\nNasa is also relying on Starship to land humans on the Moon as part of the US space agency's Artemis programme.\n\nOn his social media platform X, Musk declared that \"despite\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean! Congratulations SpaceX team on an epic achievement!!\"\n\nThe 121m rocket lifted off from its launch pad at the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, southern Texas at 7.50am local time on Thursday, carrying 10mn pounds of propellant. Powered by 32 of its 33 Raptor engines, the stage known as the \"super heavy booster\" separated less than three minutes after take-off and at an altitude of about 70km before splashing down successfully in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe upper stage -- known simply as \"ship\" and which could eventually transport Nasa astronauts to the Moon -- continued its flight to a peak altitude of more than 200km above Earth. About 49 minutes after launch, it began to re-enter the earth's atmosphere, the point near which the previous test flight failed and where temperatures can reach 1,400C, according to SpaceX.\n\nAt about 56km above Earth, one of the fins that helps orient the ship and is crucial to the manoeuvre required for a soft landing began to break apart. Nevertheless, the fin continued to operate as parts broke off, and the ship splashed down in the Indian Ocean as planned roughly one hour and six minutes after launch.\n\nAfter Starship's previous flight failed in March at an altitude of about 65km, SpaceX said it had made several hardware and software changes to achieve its goal of safe return for its two stages.\n\nStarship's last launch had completed almost an hour of flight before it was lost. Two previous test flights in 2023 had ended in explosions.\n\nFuture test flights will attempt to prove that the stages can be reused, as with Falcon 9. SpaceX is aiming to launch at least three more test flights in the next few months.\n\nCongratulating SpaceX on the flight, Nasa administrator Bill Nelson said on X: \"We are another step closer to returning humanity to the Moon through Artemis -- then looking onward to Mars!\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Altitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_landing_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soft landing (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F4bcba47a-7e13-4152-91f0-200c17f495be.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Despite this, the rocket continued to space and both stages separated cleanly.\n\nSuper Heavy splashed down as planned around 7 minutes after lift-off in the Gulf of Mexico, not far from the launch site. The booster successfully fired its engines after plummeting back to Earth from over 100 kilometres up, slowing from over 4000 kilometres per hour to a hover just metres above the sea, before the live feed cut off and it plunged into the water.\n\nMeanwhile, Starship reached orbit at an altitude over 200 kilometres and travelling at more than 27000 kilometres per hour. During its descent back to Earth, at around 60 kilometres above the surface, livestream video from SpaceX showed apparent damage to one of its four control fins, and the camera lens appeared to crack. As it reached the Indian ocean, it appeared to hover before falling into the sea.\n\nThis fourth flight test focused on getting Starship back from orbit after its previous, third test flight reached space for the first time. SpaceX chose to perform \"soft splashdowns\" in the ocean because a touchdown on land is currently deemed too risky. Instead, the vehicles use their engines to slow their descent, line up as if they were landing back at base, and gently plop into the water.\n\nEventually, the hope is that returning from space to dry land will allow the vehicles to be refurbished and re-used, as SpaceX already does with its Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nToday's launch was the company's fourth with Starship, and included software and hardware upgrades, and changes to the launch procedure, after lessons learned from previous tests. The first test in April last year exploded before the first and second stages could separate, while another in November saw the second, upper stage reach space but self-destruct when it stopped transmitting data, with the first stage blowing up just after separation.\n\nSpaceX's third Starship test flight on 14 March was at least a partial success as it reached space, carried out fuel transfer tests and travelled further and faster than ever before. But the craft failed to make its scheduled soft landing after losing attitude control mid-flight.", "source": {"uri": "newscientist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Scientist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Altitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_attitude_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft attitude control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Falcon 9"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/06135939/SEI_207593493.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 2284, "textEnd": 2292}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The separation of Starship and the Super Heavy upper stage happened during the second flight in November 2023.\n\nLast March, Starship was able to achieve suborbital flight before its fiery tumble over the Indian Ocean. The fourth flight was intended to achieve an almost-orbital flight for Starship before splashing down west of Hawaii.\n\nCurrently, SpaceX relies on its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rocket systems to send astronauts and civilians to the International Space Station, as well as to deliver payloads in Earth orbit.\n\nREAD NEXT: SpaceX Considers Selling Shares in Tender Offer, Eyeing $200 Billion

Starship has been canceled.\n\nThe project released a statement on its website Saturday (Jun. 1), saying that the mission, which was supposed to take place by 2023, has become \"unfeasible.\" However, there have been speculations of Musk and Maezawa falling off in their business partnership regarding the project.\n\nSeparately, Maezawa wrote on X that he felt \"terrible\" for making his supposed crew members wait for a longer period of time and apologized to those who have been supportive of the project.\n\nMaezawa himself visited the International Space Station in 2021, supposedly in preparation for dearMoon.\n\nAside from Maezawa, the dearMoon crew was supposed to be composed of YouTuber Tim Dodd (aka Everyday Astronaut), DJ and music producer Steve Aoki, artist and choreographer Yemi Akinyemi Dele, photographer Karim Iliya, filmmaker Brendan Hall, Indian TV actor Dev Joshi, and South Korean rapper Choi Seung-hyun (aka T.O.P.).\n\nIn particular, Dodd expressed his

After a successful launch in Texas, the spacecraft landed in the Indian Ocean just before 4pm (Dutch time). Such a smooth landing in the sea was not possible in previous test flights.\n\nSpaceX has big plans for Starship, which will be launched on the most powerful rocket ever built. The new spaceship should be able to take astronauts to the moon and even to Mars in the future. NASA wants to use a modified version as a lunar lander for the first Artemis mission. The new transportation system must also put satellites into orbit.\n\nThe combination, more than 120 meters high, consists of two parts: the Super Heavy booster rocket and the Starship spaceship that stands atop it. The goal of this fourth attempt was mainly to make a soft landing in the sea using both the booster and the spacecraft itself.\n\nIn contrast to previous attempts, the missile stopped well during this test, just before landing in the sea, without crashing. Both parts, the booster and the spacecraft, must be reusable in the future and be able to land on a platform after their flight.\n\nDuring the landing, SpaceX collected data to improve the landing program. The prototypes that have been flown on test flights so far have not yet been reused. This will only happen when a new version is introduced, at the earliest after the sixth test flight.\n\nThe first flight on April 20 last year ended within minutes when the missile went out of control.

The spacecraft on top was aiming for a half-lap around the planet with a splashdown in the Indian Ocean, once it ditched the first-stage booster in the gulf.\n\nAlso Read | US Presidential Elections 2024: Donald Trump on Campaign Trail in Arizona, To Make First Appearance in Battleground State Following His Hush Money Conviction.\n\nThis time, SpaceX was looking to avoid explosions by controlling the descents. SpaceX came close in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (metres).\n\nAlso Read | Norway: Man Dies After Falling From Famous Preikestolen Cliff Aka Pulpit Rock That Featured Tom Cruise's 'Mission Impossible' Movie.\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable. That's why SpaceX wants to control the booster's entry into the gulf and the spacecraft's descent into the Indian Ocean -- it's intended as practice for planned future landings. Nothing will be recovered from Thursday's flight.\n\nNASA has ordered a pair of Starships for two moon-landing missions by astronauts, on tap for later this decade. Each moon crew will rely on NASA's own rocket and capsule to leave Earth, but meet up with Starship in lunar orbit for the ride down to the surface.\n\nSpaceX already is selling tourist trips around the moon. The first private lunar customer, a Japanese tycoon, pulled out of the trip with his entourage last week, citing the oft-delayed schedule.\n\nSpaceX's founder and CEO has grander plans: Musk envisions fleets of Starships launching people and the infrastructure necessary to build a city on Mars.

The spacecraft on top was aiming for a half-lap around the planet with a splashdown in the Indian Ocean, once it ditched the first-stage booster in the gulf.\n\nThis time, SpaceX was looking to avoid explosions by controlling the descents. SpaceX came close in March, but lost contact with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the gulf.\n\nLast year's two test flights ended in explosions shortly after blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for thousands of feet (meters).\n\nSpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met.\n\nStarship is designed to be fully reusable. That's why SpaceX wants to control the booster's entry into the gulf and the spacecraft's descent into the Indian Ocean -- it's intended as practice for planned future landings. Nothing will be recovered from Thursday's flight.\n\nNASA has ordered a pair of Starships for two moon-landing missions by astronauts, on tap for later this decade. Each moon crew will rely on NASA's own rocket and capsule to leave Earth, but meet up with Starship in lunar orbit for the ride down to the surface.\n\nSpaceX already is selling tourist trips around the moon. The first private lunar customer, a Japanese tycoon, pulled out of the trip with his entourage last week, citing the oft-delayed schedule.\n\nSpaceX's founder and CEO has grander plans: Musk envisions fleets of Starships launching people and the infrastructure necessary to build a city on Mars.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

SpaceX founder Elon Musk posted on his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) \"Successful soft landing of the Starship Super Heavy rocket booster!\"\n\nThe 400-foot-tall rocket launched this morning (June 6) at 8:50 am EDT from its Starbase site near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. Mission goals included bringing the first-stage booster (dubbed \"Super Heavy\") back to Earth for a soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico; and a successful re-entry for 165-foot upper stage, (Starship, or simply, \"Ship\") and a soft landing in the Indian Ocean. Both goals were achieved.\n\nThe nailbiting centered on the Ship, as in-flight video showed the controlling flap's heat shield burn away during re-entry. But \"the little flap that could\" survived the intense heat and the stresses of the descent, enabling the Ship to \"nail\" its landing in the Indian Ocean.\n\nDuring a live feed from company headquarters in Hawthorne, California, SpaceX spokesperson Dan Huot reported, \"This whole building was going absolutely insane. When we saw the booster hit the water, I mean, wow.\"\n\nAccording to the SpaceX website post, \"We're continuing to rapidly develop Starship, putting flight hardware in a flight environment to learn as quickly as possible as we build a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and beyond.\"", "source": {"uri": "avweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AVweb"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_phelps@avweb.com", "name": "Mark Phelps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_landing_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soft landing (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geocentric orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hawthorne, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawthorne, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Undeveloped_or_Vacant", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Undeveloped or Vacant", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/24-6-7-AVFlash-SpaceX.jpeg.optimal.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 361, "textEnd": 367}], "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The world's biggest rocket took off at 6:20 pm from SpaceX's launch site in Boca Chica, Texas and it achieved all the objectives on its way to the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt flawlessly cleared the launch pad followed by a successful separation of the Super Heavy Booster from the upper stage Ship three minutes post lift off.\n\nSpaceX said that one of the main objectives of the mission was to ensure the Ship survives re-entry before its splashdown in the Indian Ocean. And it did survive, against all odds.\n\nPost the stage separation, there was a successful execution of landing burn on the Super Heavy Booster during its return. It then splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico for the first time ever completing a major objective. SpaceX had lost the Booster before achieving this milestone in flight 3.\n\nAnother first in this mission was the jettison of Super Heavy's ring-like hot-stage component to reduce its weight and ensure an easy splashdown.\n\nAfter the first-ever controlled splashdown of the Booster, the upper stage continued on its journey to space where the most harrowing challenge of re-entry awaited. About 20 minutes post lift off, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk announced the acquisition of signal from the Ship in orbit.\n\nUnlike flight 3, the Ship was able to endure the unforgiving temperature of 1,400 degrees Celsius as it travelled at supersonic speeds. The onboard camera even caught broken heatshield tiles flying off before its lens cracked as the plasma build up intensified during re-entry.\n\nIn a post on X, Musk said that Starship went all the way \"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap.\"\n\n\"Congratulations SpaceX team on an epic achievement!!\" he further said.\n\nALSO SEE: Starship Is Launching Again On June 6; What Is Different This Time?\n\nPrior to the launch, SpaceX revealed that the teams had removed two of the Ship's heatshield tiles to gather information on how hot the exposed areas will get. This data will help in future flights.\n\nALSO SEE: Actor Dev Joshi's Week-Long Trip Around The Moon On Starship Cancelled\n\nAt 7:27 pm, about one hour and five minutes after launch, the Ship's splashdown was confirmed in the Indian Ocean. It followed the same trajectory as the previous mission.\n\nThis was the most successful mission of Starship to date, breaking the record of travelling the fastest and farthest set in previous flight on March 14. Since there were no explosions and safety hazards this time, we might see a fifth launch of Starship fairly sooner. And maybe SpaceX will recover both the rocket stages in the next one as a major step toward reusability.\n\n(Image: SpaceX)", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_speed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supersonic speed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/seo/7/74187/74187_c552.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 43, "textEnd": 49, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 2438, "textEnd": 2446}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

It followed a hard crash landing and fiery destruction of the uncrewed craft last November, seven months after its inaugural test launch ended in similar fashion, and its breakup on re-entry after a trip around the planet in March.\n\n\"Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!\" Musk, SpaceX's chief executive, wrote in a post to X, the social media platform the billionaire also owns.\n\nMusk hailed Thursday's hour-long, fourth test flight as \"an epic achievement\".

In 2021, Nasa chose Starship as its preferred lander for the Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time since 1972, and ultimately on to Mars before the end of the next decade.\n\nIn January, Nasa announced that Artemis III, which will land four astronauts including the first woman on the lunar surface, had been delayed until at least September 2026. The under-development SpaceX lander will rendezvous with the astronauts in orbit before descending to the moon.\n\nSince partnering with Nasa, SpaceX has become an integral part of the burgeoning, next-generation commercial space industry.\n\nIt has launched more than 50 humans into space onboard its own Falcon rockets and Dragon capsules, and has pioneered the Starlink chain of internet-providing satellites that has transformed communications in remote areas of the globe.\n\nBut Starlink has also run into controversy for allegedly helping Russia in its military invasion of Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_luscombe@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Richard Luscombe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_landing_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soft landing (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artemis 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artemis program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/b270a10d57f8a1d2016410f0f8b2a774", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Designed to outperform the Falcon 9, it promises enhanced power and cost efficiency. However, past tests have highlighted its challenges: the first flight exploded minutes after liftoff, the second reached space before rapidly disintegrating, and the third broke apart on re-entry. This trial will see the Super Heavy booster ignite its 33 Raptor engines for a 'soft splash-down' in the Gulf of Mexico, while Starship aims to endure atmospheric re-entry over the Indian Ocean. With hundreds of black tiles shielding against re-entry heat, Elon Musk emphasizes that this mission's goal is to penetrate much deeper into the atmospheric layer.\n\nSpaceX's progress with Starship is vital as NASA depends on it for the 2026 moon mission, competing against China's 2030 lunar ambitions. Investor in space tech could soar if SpaceX succeeds, but the company's aggressive timelines have faced scrutiny, revealing worker safety concerns and leading to project delays, like last week's moon flight cancellation by a Japanese billionaire.\n\nThe bigger picture: A new frontier of exploration.\n\nWith the FAA's green light for this next Starship test, the outcome could redefine future space travel.

In 2021, Nasa chose Starship as its preferred lander for the Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time since 1972, and ultimately on to Mars before the end of the next decade.\n\nIn January, Nasa announced that Artemis III, which will land four astronauts including the first woman on the lunar surface, had been delayed until at least September 2026. The under-development SpaceX lander will rendezvous with the astronauts in orbit before descending to the moon.\n\nSince partnering with Nasa, SpaceX has become an integral part of the burgeoning, next-generation commercial space industry.\n\nIt has launched more than 50 humans into space on-board its own Falcon rockets and Dragon capsules, and has pioneered the Starlink chain of internet-providing satellites that has transformed communications in remote areas of the globe.\n\nBut Starlink has also run into controversy for allegedly helping Russia in its military invasion of Ukraine. - Guardian", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_landing_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soft landing (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artemis 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artemis program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/Z0lgLBCePhaDL3D5VZNbNg5HEtY=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/C555GI5VESUMAVAPFMDXMDWBIM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

The most powerful rocket in the world that can fly today", "body": "The launch window for the fourth test flight of the Starship rocket opens on Thursday. After partial success, SpaceX hopes to return both sections of the ship safely to Earth. However, the launch will take place under some controversy.\n\nAccording to SpaceX, the launch window for the spacecraft's rocket test flight will open on Thursday, June 6 at 7 a.m. CST (2 p.m. Poland time). If all goes according to plan, the \"world's most powerful rocket\" will lift off from Starbase in Texas and ascend into Earth's space before returning to the atmosphere.\n\nFor its fourth test flight, SpaceX is aiming for a controlled landing of both components of the Starship system -- the orbiter and the SuperHeavy booster that helps put the Starship into orbit. This demonstration aims to show that both elements of the system can be used repeatedly, which could reduce the costs of space travel, including very long trips - to the Moon or even Mars.\n\nDuring its previous test flight in mid-March, the spacecraft performed its first atmospheric re-entry maneuver from space. At this point it was destroyed, but during the flight engineers collected so much data that it is difficult to overestimate it. According to the company, various elements of hardware and software have been optimized based on it, which will make it possible to achieve landings. The flight plan was also changed, including the moment of separation of the booster, which will reduce its mass in the final phase of the flight.\n\nThe spacecraft will follow a similar path to its last flight, allowing it to land on the ocean. Such a path does not require starting engines during re-entry and reduces potential threats to people and buildings on Earth.\n\nThe test flight will take place a few days after the cancellation of DearMoon, a private initiative of Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa.

During the coast phase, Starship opened and closed its payload bay door and transferred propellant from a liquid-oxygen header tank into the main tank, a demonstration in support of upcoming missions for NASA's Artemis Moon program.\n\nHowever, several minutes into its coast, Starship began losing attitude control, prompting cancellation of a third test to re-light a Raptor engine in space. \"The lack of attitude control resulted in an off-nominal entry, with the ship seeing much larger than anticipated heating on both protected and unprotected areas,\" SpaceX wrote in a May 24 program update.\n\nTelemetry was lost at 40 mi. in altitude, roughly 49 min. into the mission.\n\nSpaceX says clogged valves most likely caused the unplanned roll. That has been addressed for IFT-4 with upgraded hardware to mitigate blockages and additional roll-control thrusters to improve attitude-control redundancy.\n\nA successful simulated landing for the Super Heavy booster is the other top objective for IFT-4. On the last flight, the Super Heavy ignited 13 engines as planned for the boostback burn after stage separation, but six of the Raptors shut down early.\n\nThe booster continued its descent toward the designated splashdown site in the Gulf of Mexico but was unable to restart the same 13 engines needed for the landing burn. The six diasbled engines could not be restarted, leaving seven for the burn. Of those, just two operated successfully, scotching plans for a soft, controlled touchdown in the water. SpaceX lost contact with IFT-3's booster just under 7 min. into the flight when the Super Heavy was about 1,516 ft. above the water.\n\n\"The most likely root cause for the early boostback burn shutdown was determined to be continued filter blockage where liquid oxygen is supplied to the engines, leading to a loss of inlet pressure in engine oxygen turbopumps,\" SpaceX wrote.\n\nThe company had made hardware changes ahead of IFT-3 to mitigate this issue. For IFT-4 and future flights, the booster's oxygen tanks were modified further to improve propellant filtration. Engineers also made hardware and software changes to increase the reliability of Raptor engines igniting in landing conditions.\n\nFor IFT-4, SpaceX also made an operational change for the Super Heavy to jettison its hot-stage adapter after the boostback burn to reduce mass for the final phase of flight.\n\n\"The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said. \"The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship.\"\n\nIFT-4's trajectory will replicate IFT-3, with Starship's splashdown targeted in the Indian Ocean -- a path that does not require a deorbit burn for reentry. The suborbital trajectory provides SpaceX the opportunity to meet its primary objective -- a controlled Starship reentry -- with less risk to public safety and a potentially shorter turnaround time between flights.", "source": {"uri": "aviationweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aviation Week"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_attitude_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft attitude control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Payload"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intercontinental ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redundancy (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Splashdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telemetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Control_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Control Systems", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Chemical_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Chemical Engineering", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/2024-06/spacex_starship_super_heavy_spacex.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 17}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 190, "textEnd": 196}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 446, "textEnd": 454}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 1118, "textEnd": 1124}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

It was amazing to watch the fourth test flight of SpaceX's Starship. If you didn't catch it live, don't worry. You will see these images countless times over the coming hours and days.\n\nThe launch was nothing short of stunning, in some ways rivaling the launch of a Saturn V launch vehicle and in other ways far more impressive.\n\nOf course, the craft doesn't carry men to the moon--yet, at least--and it is only in its test phase, so at this stage the emotional charge is hardly comparable.\n\nThat may change, though, if Starship fulfills its intended mission, which is to bring men to the moon from orbit and eventually get men to Mars.\n\nFirst, let's get a few things out of the way for those who haven't been following the development of Starship as closely as us geeks: unlike the Saturn V and pretty much any vehicle made by the US government (through contractors, of course), SpaceX's development strategy is vastly different.\n\nNASA designs its spacecraft to work the first time they fly, so they are exquisitely engineered from the beginning. This has the advantage of making a craft that doesn't tend to blow up for all the cameras to see, but also means that they are wildly expensive to develop, can take forever to build, and never meet budget targets.\n\nSpaceX's strategy is vastly different. The design process is iterative--start with a \"good enough\" design, test and break it, figuring out the strengths and weaknesses. Rinse, repeat.\n\nNASA's strategy got us to the moon--at an expense inconceivable to the mortal mind. It still blows our mind, and exhausting America's taste for big projects and never, ever getting us close to easy and regular access to space. In fact, NASA still can't provide easy and cheap access to space.\n\nSpaceX revolutionized the space industry and is still incalculably ahead of any competitor. This year, the company will launch about 90% of the mass sent to space. Every country on Earth and every private competitor combined will launch 1/9th of what Elon Musk's company does. The US government itself relies on SpaceX for access to space, and the US military is likely SpaceX's protector against the Biden administration's vendetta against Musk.\n\nShould Starship come close to meeting Musk's rather optimistic goals, it will be a quantum leap in capability. Ultimately, the goal is rapid reusability, a massive payload that rivals Apollo's (although Apollo could deliver its payload all the way to the moon, not Earth orbit), and point-to-point travel between locations on our planet at ridiculous speeds.\n\nThis being only the fourth test of the ship, there were successes and failures. Both vehicles performed well--meeting almost all the goals for the mission from launch to simulated landings, but it appears that only the booster made it all the way back to the surface unscathed.\n\nNeither craft was intended to be recovered--the intent was to do \"soft\" landings at sea for safety reasons (in case they came down uncontrolled), and we were treated to live views beamed over Starlink all the way down for the booster, and almost all the way down for the Starship itself.\n\nWhere Starship \"failed\" (it met its basic goals, including providing data at all stages of flight), was what appeared to be severe damage to the fins that guide the craft in the atmosphere, which are far more complicated and fragile than the grid fins on the booster. We were treated to video of the fin partially disintegrating, although it appears that even after severe damage it functioned as designed when it counted.\n\nAppeared--we still don't know how \"soft\" the landing at sea was. I suspect it didn't perform as designed in the last few hundred feet, but that is my own WAG based on what we saw. The protective shield on the camera was cracked and covered in soot by that point, making it difficult to guess what happened.\n\nPeople underestimate how impressive our ability to watch high-definition footage of everything really is. Without Starlink this would be impossible, and nothing like it has been seen before. Actually watching a spacecraft penetrate the atmosphere and land live and in HD should shock you, but these days we expect Elon Musk to perform miracles.\n\nStarship will of course be done on \"Elon time,\" meaning faster than anybody else could possibly do, and far slower than Elon promises. Don't expect Starship to be on its way to Mars anytime soon, but expect it work eventually and become routine far sooner than anybody would have guessed a decade ago.\n\nMusk is a character out of Heinlein.

However, the rocket has a margin in the case of such failure and the booster continued on the nominal trajectory.\n\nLess than three minutes into the flight, Starship performed the hot staging during which the Super Heavy booster was disconnected from the upper stage. For the first time, the Super Heavy performed nominal boostback burn with all 13 inner engines necessary for the maneuver.\n\nShortly after the seven-minute mark, the Super Heavy booster performed a landing burn.

It surpasses the height of the Saturn V rockets that transported Apollo astronauts to the moon.\n\nToday's fourth test flight will continue advancing Starship's progress and heavily focus on a deeper re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.\n\nMusk recently wrote on X that Starship's \"main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during re-entry, ideally through max heating.\"\n\nRocket blog Spaceflight Now provided more insight into the mishaps during test flight three and how systems were upgraded to ensure a deeper re-entry into Earth's atmosphere for today's test flight:\n\nDuring Flight 3, the upper stage began to roll uncontrollably, preventing the vehicle from performing a relight of one of its six Raptor engines. However, thanks to its ability to connect to the Starlink satellite internet network, another part of SpaceX's business, the rocket was able to stream back high definition camera views showing its re-entry through a blanket of plasma.\n\n\"The lack of attitude control resulted in an off-nominal entry, with the ship seeing much larger than anticipated heating on both protected and unprotected areas,\" SpaceX said in a post-launch blog. \"The most likely root cause of the unplanned roll was determined to be clogging of the valves responsible for roll control. SpaceX has since added additional roll control thrusters on upcoming Starships to improve attitude control redundancy and upgraded hardware for improved resilience to blockage.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Super Heavy Booster from the last flight also prematurely shut down six out of 13 Raptor engines used during the boostback burn, which remained offline when it attempted to perform a landing burn.\n\n\"The booster had lower than expected landing burn thrust when contact was lost at approximately 462 meters in altitude over the Gulf of Mexico and just under seven minutes into the mission,\" SpaceX stated. \"The most likely root cause for the early boostback burn shutdown was determined to be continued filter blockage where liquid oxygen is supplied to the engines, leading to a loss of inlet pressure in engine oxygen turbopumps.\"\n\n\"Super Heavy boosters for Flight 4 and beyond will get additional hardware inside oxygen tanks to further improve propellant filtration capabilities.\"\n\nAll of these test flights are part of Starship's development process. The hope is to commission the world's largest rocket for moon and Mars missions by the end of the decade or the early 2030s.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Starbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boca Chica (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saturn V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_attitude_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft attitude control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-06/GPXBuJQb0AAHfQi.jpg?itok=eP8R7sN5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625730", "eventUri": "eng-9625730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Assuming the launch comes off as planned, this will mark Boeing's first successful launch of a crewed spacecraft under its commercial crew contract with NASA, and the first real competition for SpaceX's dominance in crewed spaceflight.\n\nCoincidentally, June 6 may also mark another test flight of SpaceX's answer to Starliner, its own reusable Starship -- a combination of a new booster rocket (Super Heavy) and attached spacecraft (the Starship proper). The fully stacked Starship is preparing for its fourth uncrewed test flight after three previous abortive attempts.\n\nRounding out the list of June space-happenings, over in Europe: Arianespace, a 50-50 joint venture between Airbus (EADSY -1.68%) and Safran SA, continues to work out the kinks on its own next-generation rocket, the Ariane 6. Four years overdue and already apparently overbudget, the Ariane 6 is preparing for its first flight (also uncrewed); this could be Arianespace's last chance to remain relevant in an increasingly crowded space race.\n\nIt may also serve to highlight the fact that this increasingly looks like a race between two dinosaurs -- and one particular raptor that's evolved to fly faster (and cheaper) than either of its biggest rivals.\n\nStakes seem high for both Boeing and Airbus.\n\nBoeing has already recorded losses approaching $1 billion on the Starliner project, which failed its first launch attempt in 2019, and only passed its second attempt in 2022 if graded on a curve. We've been waiting ever since for Boeing to make a third attempt, this time with astronauts on board. Notably, Starliner was supposed to try to fly last summer; attempts to launch this summer have so far been stymied by technical glitches ranging from sticky valves to a perpetually leaking helium tank.\n\nMost worryingly, further delays could snowball, with a busy traffic schedule of spacecraft coming and going at the International Space Station (ISS) this summer. Ars Technica noted last month that if Starliner can't get off the pad in June, it might be able to reschedule for July. Failing that, though, August and September both look pretty booked at ISS, potentially forcing Boeing to wait until October or later for its launch -- as losses from the program mount.\n\nIn such a case, we might see Arianespace get its new rocket in orbit before Boeing can launch Starliner. Admittedly, this would be more of a PR victory than anything else. But considering how long Airbus investors (and Arianespace customers) have been waiting for this rocket to get airborne, the company would certainly welcome some good news -- and positive publicity for a rocket designed to compete not only with SpaceX's Falcon 9, but also with the ULA's new Vulcan Centaur rocket (which made its own successful first launch in January).\n\nOf course, all the above could become irrelevant depending on the results of Starship flight test No. 4.\n\nLast time around, SpaceX's Super Heavy booster failed to achieve a soft water landing when some of its engines failed to reignite on descent. Soon after, Starship seemed to lose control and break apart while reentering the atmosphere. SpaceX has made tweaks to both elements of the megarocket, however, and will now try to get both to survive to their intended endpoints.\n\nSuccess would set up SpaceX for a fifth flight test, one that might see one or both elements successfully land on solid ground -- a crucial goal for proving Starship can function as a reusable rocket. And future tests would follow, eventually seeking certification for Starship to carry human passengers as well as cargo.\n\nWhat would that mean for Boeing and Airbus? Their rival SpaceX would have a fully reusable rocket and spacecraft, descending meteor-like from the skies, over and over again in repeated blazes of glory.

Additionally, China's Chang'e-6 probe returns lunar samples, and SpaceX's latest Starship rocket test gets FAA approval for its ambitious reusable satellite and moon lander development.\n\nFollowing is a summary of current science news briefs.\n\nChile to install world's largest astronomy camera on the edge of Atacama desert\n\nWith a resolution above 3.2 gigapixels, a nearly three-ton weight and the ambitious task of carrying out an unprecedented decade-long exploration, the largest digital camera ever built for optical astronomy is ready to be installed under the clear skies of northern Chile. The pieces required to assemble the Vera C. Rubin Observatory - which includes a ground-based telescope and the camera - traveled in several vehicles to the summit of Cerro Pach\u00f3n in the Coquimbo region, on the edge of the Atacama desert, some 565 kilometers north of Santiago.\n\nEurope's Ariane 6 rocket debut planned for July 9\n\nEurope's new Ariane 6 satellite launcher will stage a long-awaited inaugural flight on July 9, the head of the European Space Agency said at the Berlin Airshow on Wednesday. The delayed debut comes a year after its predecessor, Ariane 5, was retired, leaving Europe with no independent path to orbit for its satellites after setbacks involving a smaller Italian alternative and the severing of ties with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nBoeing Starliner capsule nears first crewed ISS docking as new issues arise\n\nBoeing's new Starliner capsule and its inaugural two-member NASA crew were set to approach the International Space Station for docking on Thursday after helium leaks detected on the spacecraft showed fresh problems in the crucial test mission. The CST-100 Starliner, with veteran astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams aboard, launched to space on Wednesday from Florida for a much-delayed test flight aimed at demonstrating the spacecraft's flightworthiness and sharpening Boeing's competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nFactbox-Who are the first astronauts to fly aboard Boeing's Starliner?\n\nTwo veteran NASA astronauts with 500 days of previous spaceflight experience between them are the first crew of Boeing's pxpCST-100 Starliner space capsule, launched to space in a test flight on Wednesday from Florida. Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams are set to test Starliner's manual controls before it docks with the International Space Station (ISS) in orbit on Thursday. Both will be arriving at the ISS for the third time.\n\nChina's Chang'e-6 transfers moon samples to spacecraft, set for return to Earth\n\nChina's Chang'e-6 probe transferred samples it collected from the moon's far side to a spacecraft in lunar orbit on Thursday, state news agency Xinhua reported. After receiving the samples, the uncrewed spacecraft will fly back to Earth, with an expected landing in China's Inner Mongolia region on June 25. If successful, China will be the first country to ever return lunar matter from the side of the moon that permanently faces away from Earth.\n\nChina's Space Pioneer raises $207 million to fund development of reusable rockets\n\nBeijing-based rocket developer Space Pioneer said on Thursday that it had completed more than 1.5 billion yuan ($207 million) round of fundraising that will go towards financing the development of its reusable rockets. Space Pioneer, also known as Beijing Tianbing Technology Co, is among a small group of rapidly growing private-sector rocket developers, spurred by the government's call to transform China into a major space power.\n\nChina says open to space cooperation with US but 'hurdles' remain\n\nChina remains open towards cooperation with countries including the United States in space, the foreign ministry said on Thursday, following congratulations from U.S. space agency NASA on China's Chang'e-6 mission to the far side of the moon. But the United States needs to remove obstacles towards further cooperation, Mao Ning, a spokesperson at the ministry, said at a regular news conference.\n\nSpaceX's next Starship rocket test gets FAA go-ahead\n\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday said it issued a license for SpaceX's fourth flight of its Starship rocket system, another test mission along the company's path to building a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander. SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk, is aiming to launch its nearly 400-foot-tall (122-meter), two-stage Starship as early as Thursday at 7 a.m. CDT (1200 GMT) from its rocket facilities in south Texas, from which past flights in the company's test-to-failure development campaign have launched.\n\nSpaceX launches giant Starship rocket on fourth test flight\n\nSpaceX's giant Starship rocket launched from south Texas on Thursday for its fourth test toward space to execute a tricky primary objective: survive a blazingly hot re-entry through Earth's atmosphere, the violent phase where the rocket broke apart during its last attempt. The two-stage spacecraft, consisting of the Starship cruise vessel mounted atop its towering Super Heavy rocket booster, blasted off from the company's Starbase launch site near Boca Chica Village on the Gulf Coast of Texas. It is the latest trial mission in the test-to-failure rocket development campaign of Elon Musk's company.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_6", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ariane 6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atacama Desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_C._Rubin_Observatory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vera C.

The launch will take place from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted the launch license on Tuesday, allowing the 400-foot-tall megarocket to be launched for the fourth time. You can watch the livestream on SpaceX's official account on X.\n\nThe fourth test flight's main focus is to demonstrate reusability by returning both stages of the rocket to Earth. The primary objectives include executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the first-stage booster called Super Heavy, and achieving a controlled re-entry of upper-stage spacecraft, also called Starship.Musk stated, \"The main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during reentry, ideally through max heating.\"\n\nThe flight trajectory will be similar to previous tests, with a splashdown targeted for the Indian Ocean after reentering without performing a deorbit burn. This decision was made to maximize public safety while still meeting primary reentry objectives.

The test completed several exciting firsts, including the first Starship reentry from space, the first ever opening and closing of Starship's payload door in space, and a successful propellant transfer demonstration. This last test provided valuable data for eventual ship-to-ship propellant transfers that will enable missions like returning astronauts to the Moon under NASA's Artemis program,\" the SpaceX website said.\n\n\"The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy. The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship,\" the website said.\n\nFor the latest news and launch schedule from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and NASA's Kennedy Space Center, visit floridatoday.com/space.\n\nRick Neale is a Space Reporter at FLORIDA TODAY.

Assuming the launch comes off as planned, this will mark Boeing's first successful launch of a crewed spacecraft under its commercial crew contract with NASA, and the first real competition for SpaceX's dominance in crewed spaceflight.\n\nCoincidentally, June 6 may also mark another test flight of SpaceX's answer to Starliner, its own reusable Starship -- a combination of a new booster rocket (Super Heavy) and attached spacecraft (the Starship proper). The fully stacked Starship is preparing for its fourth uncrewed test flight after three previous abortive attempts.\n\nRounding out the list of June space-happenings, over in Europe: Arianespace, a 50-50 joint venture between Airbus (OTC: EADSY) and Safran SA, continues to work out the kinks on its own next-generation rocket, the Ariane 6. Four years overdue and already apparently overbudget, the Ariane 6 is preparing for its first flight (also uncrewed); this could be Arianespace's last chance to remain relevant in an increasingly crowded space race.\n\nIt may also serve to highlight the fact that this increasingly looks like a race between two dinosaurs -- and one particular raptor that's evolved to fly faster (and cheaper) than either of its biggest rivals.\n\nBoeing has already recorded losses approaching $1 billion on the Starliner project, which failed its first launch attempt in 2019, and only passed its second attempt in 2022 if graded on a curve. We've been waiting ever since for Boeing to make a third attempt, this time with astronauts on board. Notably, Starliner was supposed to try to fly last summer; attempts to launch this summer have so far been stymied by technical glitches ranging from sticky valves to a perpetually leaking helium tank.\n\nMost worryingly, further delays could snowball, with a busy traffic schedule of spacecraft coming and going at the International Space Station (ISS) this summer. Ars Technica noted last month that if Starliner can't get off the pad in June, it might be able to reschedule for July. Failing that, though, August and September both look pretty booked at ISS, potentially forcing Boeing to wait until October or later for its launch -- as losses from the program mount.\n\nIn such a case, we might see Arianespace get its new rocket in orbit before Boeing can launch Starliner. Admittedly, this would be more of a PR victory than anything else. But considering how long Airbus investors (and Arianespace customers) have been waiting for this rocket to get airborne, the company would certainly welcome some good news -- and positive publicity for a rocket designed to compete not only with SpaceX's Falcon 9, but also with the ULA's new Vulcan Centaur rocket (which made its own successful first launch in January).\n\nDinosaurs versus the SpaceX meteor\n\nOf course, all the above could become irrelevant depending on the results of Starship flight test No. 4.\n\nLast time around, SpaceX's Super Heavy booster failed to achieve a soft water landing when some of its engines failed to reignite on descent. Soon after, Starship seemed to lose control and break apart while reentering the atmosphere. SpaceX has made tweaks to both elements of the megarocket, however, and will now try to get both to survive to their intended endpoints.\n\nSuccess would set up SpaceX for a fifth flight test, one that might see one or both elements successfully land on solid ground -- a crucial goal for proving Starship can function as a reusable rocket. And future tests would follow, eventually seeking certification for Starship to carry human passengers as well as cargo.\n\nWhat would that mean for Boeing and Airbus? Their rival SpaceX would have a fully reusable rocket and spacecraft, descending meteor-like from the skies, over and over again in repeated blazes of glory. This megarocket would be ready for reuse at a fraction of the cost of building new rockets (like Ariane 6) and capable of carrying massively greater payloads than either Ariane 6 or the Vulcan Centaur, and many more astronauts than Starliner.\n\nWhichever of these missions ends up launching first, I'm pretty confident which of these three space companies will still be around at the last.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Boeing wasn't one of them.

Upcoming SpaceX, NASA, ULA rocket launch schedule in Florida\n\nFriday's scheduled launch will occur on the heels of two internationally significant space missions. On Wednesday morning, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams soared into orbit aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on its first-ever crewed mission from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\nThen Thursday morning, SpaceX is scheduled to launch its jumbo-sized Starship rocket on its fourth test flight from Boca Chica, Texas.\n\n\"Starship's third flight test made tremendous strides towards a future of rapidly reliable reusable rockets. The test completed several exciting firsts, including the first Starship reentry from space, the first ever opening and closing of Starship's payload door in space, and a successful propellant transfer demonstration. This last test provided valuable data for eventual ship-to-ship propellant transfers that will enable missions like returning astronauts to the Moon under NASA's Artemis program,\" the SpaceX website said.\n\n\"The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy. The primary objectives will be executing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico with the Super Heavy booster, and achieving a controlled entry of Starship,\" the website said.\n\nFor the latest news and launch schedule from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and NASA's Kennedy Space Center, visit floridatoday.com/space.\n\nRick Neale is a Space Reporter at FLORIDA TODAY.

Assuming the launch comes off as planned, this will mark Boeing's first successful launch of a crewed spacecraft under its commercial crew contract with NASA, and the first real competition for SpaceX's dominance in crewed spaceflight.\n\nCoincidentally, June 6 may also mark another test flight of SpaceX's answer to Starliner, its own reusable Starship -- a combination of a new booster rocket (Super Heavy) and attached spacecraft (the Starship proper). The fully stacked Starship is preparing for its fourth uncrewed test flight after three previous abortive attempts.\n\nRounding out the list of June space-happenings, over in Europe: Arianespace, a 50-50 joint venture between Airbus (OTC: EADSY) and Safran SA, continues to work out the kinks on its own next-generation rocket, the Ariane 6. Four years overdue and already apparently overbudget, the Ariane 6 is preparing for its first flight (also uncrewed); this could be Arianespace's last chance to remain relevant in an increasingly crowded space race.\n\nIt may also serve to highlight the fact that this increasingly looks like a race between two dinosaurs -- and one particular raptor that's evolved to fly faster (and cheaper) than either of its biggest rivals.\n\nStakes seem high for both Boeing and Airbus.\n\nBoeing has already recorded losses approaching $1 billion on the Starliner project, which failed its first launch attempt in 2019, and only passed its second attempt in 2022 if graded on a curve. We've been waiting ever since for Boeing to make a third attempt, this time with astronauts on board. Notably, Starliner was supposed to try to fly last summer; attempts to launch this summer have so far been stymied by technical glitches ranging from sticky valves to a perpetually leaking helium tank.\n\nMost worryingly, further delays could snowball, with a busy traffic schedule of spacecraft coming and going at the International Space Station (ISS) this summer. Ars Technica noted last month that if Starliner can't get off the pad in June, it might be able to reschedule for July. Failing that, though, August and September both look pretty booked at ISS, potentially forcing Boeing to wait until October or later for its launch -- as losses from the program mount.\n\nIn such a case, we might see Arianespace get its new rocket in orbit before Boeing can launch Starliner. Admittedly, this would be more of a PR victory than anything else. But considering how long Airbus investors (and Arianespace customers) have been waiting for this rocket to get airborne, the company would certainly welcome some good news -- and positive publicity for a rocket designed to compete not only with SpaceX's Falcon 9, but also with the ULA's new Vulcan Centaur rocket (which made its own successful first launch in January).\n\nOf course, all the above could become irrelevant depending on the results of Starship flight test No. 4.\n\nLast time around, SpaceX's Super Heavy booster failed to achieve a soft water landing when some of its engines failed to reignite on descent. Soon after, Starship seemed to lose control and break apart while reentering the atmosphere. SpaceX has made tweaks to both elements of the megarocket, however, and will now try to get both to survive to their intended endpoints.\n\nSuccess would set up SpaceX for a fifth flight test, one that might see one or both elements successfully land on solid ground -- a crucial goal for proving Starship can function as a reusable rocket. And future tests would follow, eventually seeking certification for Starship to carry human passengers as well as cargo.\n\nWhat would that mean for Boeing and Airbus? Their rival SpaceX would have a fully reusable rocket and spacecraft, descending meteor-like from the skies, over and over again in repeated blazes of glory. This megarocket would be ready for reuse at a fraction of the cost of building new rockets (like Ariane 6) and capable of carrying massively greater payloads than either Ariane 6 or the Vulcan Centaur, and many more astronauts than Starliner.\n\nWhichever of these missions ends up launching first, I'm pretty confident which of these three space companies will still be around at the last.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Boeing wasn't one of them.

The company is now making final preparations for launch on Thursday, June 6.\n\nTuesday afternoon, the FAA announced it modified SpaceX's existing launch license for its Starship launch vehicle for another launch post safety and mishap investigations by the agency and the company.\n\nThis clears the red-tape ahead of SpaceX's planned Thursday launch of Ship 29 and Booster 11 vehicles. The approval might also clear investigations by the FAA in the future with the license wording suggesting no review needed if a similar failure occurs.\n\nStarship Flight 4 will have a group of key mission objectives, many similar than Flight 3.

Second, and extremely important for Starship's, and even NASA's, development timeline, will be splashing the Ship into the ocean at the end of flight.\n\nWithout this, SpaceX cannot move forward with bigger and longer test flights.\n\nOn Flight 3, most of these took place without issue. The rocket lifted off with the Booster placing the Ship into its correct flight trajectory. However, three things didn't go right on the mission: opening the payload door didn't look like it was successful, issues with attitude control mean the propellent transfer test didn't get completed, and the Ship did not survive reentry.\n\nSo, going into Thursday, if any of these three objectives don't succeed again, I would personally look at this mission as a failure. NASA really needs SpaceX to move forward with Starship development. While there are a lot of things with Artemis that will cause the first landing to be delayed, the HLS program was a big risk for NASA that it needs to get right.\n\nStreams from local outlets will start up in the very wee hours of Thursday morning.

The launch, dubbed Flight 4, will push the launch vehicle towards its goal of being a mostly reusable rocket.\n\nSimilarly to the previous three launches, Flight 4 will not include a payload and will fly a suborbital trajectory. Liftoff is set for 7:20 a.m. CDT (8:20 a.m. EDT, 1220 UTC), near the opening of a 120-minute window.\n\nSpaceflight Now will have joint live coverage alongside LabPadre beginning at 6:45 a.m. EDT (1045 UTC).\n\nOn Wednesday, SpaceX stacked the Ship upper stage (Ship 29) on top of the Super Heavy Booster (Booster 11) to create the 121 m (397 ft) Starship rocket. Both components will be expended as a result of the flight, but the way SpaceX structured the mission, it hopes this will demonstrate their future reuse capabilities.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) on June 1, SpaceX founder Elon Musk stated that \"the main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during reentry, ideally through max heating.\"\n\nDuring Flight 3, the upper stage began to roll uncontrollably, preventing the vehicle from performing a relight of one of its six Raptor engines. However, thanks to its ability to connect to the Starlink satellite internet network, another part of SpaceX's business, the rocket was able to stream back high definition camera views showing its reentry through a blanket of plasma.\n\n\"The lack of attitude control resulted in an off-nominal entry, with the ship seeing much larger than anticipated heating on both protected and unprotected areas,\" SpaceX said in a post-launch blog. \"The most likely root cause of the unplanned roll was determined to be clogging of the valves responsible for roll control. SpaceX has since added additional roll control thrusters on upcoming Starships to improve attitude control redundancy and upgraded hardware for improved resilience to blockage.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Super Heavy Booster from the last flight also prematurely shut down six out of 13 Raptor engines used during the boostback burn, which remained offline when it attempted to perform a landing burn.\n\n\"The booster had lower than expected landing burn thrust when contact was lost at approximately 462 meters in altitude over the Gulf of Mexico and just under seven minutes into the mission,\" SpaceX stated. \"The most likely root cause for the early boostback burn shutdown was determined to be continued filter blockage where liquid oxygen is supplied to the engines, leading to a loss of inlet pressure in engine oxygen turbopumps.\"\n\n\"Super Heavy boosters for Flight 4 and beyond will get additional hardware inside oxygen tanks to further improve propellant filtration capabilities.\"\n\nThe forthcoming Flight 4 is an important mission not only for SpaceX, but also for NASA. The rocket will take center stage when the agency embarks on the Artemis 3 mission, which is currently targeting September 2026.\n\nLisa Watson-Morgan, the manager of the Human Landing System program, and her team continue to work alongside SpaceX to understand the development of the rocket that will serve as the Moon lander for the yet-to-be-named astronauts of the Artemis 3 and Artemis 4 missions.\n\n\"It was great to see the lessons that came out of [flights] one and two and to see how that was employed either through manufacturing, production, through operations of how Flight 3 was conducted,\" Watson-Morgan said. \"There weren't any issues around Raptor. No fires and a lot of good consistency, frankly, around the engines. When you get all those engines to light up, for us, it was a significant win.\"\n\nShe noted that while the Raptor relight on the upper stage during Flight 3 wasn't able to be accomplished, there's still plenty of time to achieve that milestone. Watson-Morgan said they would need to see it demonstrated either in the back half of 2024 or in early 2025.\n\n\"As SpaceX continues to mature their Raptors, because they're working through their design and development, as they do that, they're making modifications and adjustments and changes,\" Watson-Morgan said. \"And all of that's getting incorporated into an updated build sequence.\"\n\nOne of the successes that Watson-Morgan and NASA took note of was the propellant transfer, which shifted liquid oxygen (LOX) from the ship's header tank to the main upper stage LOX tank. That was designed to fulfill a $53.2 million Tipping Point contract with NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), which had a requirement to demonstrate the transfer of 10 metric tons of propellant.\n\nWatson-Morgan said that while the HLS office was not directly involved with that, representatives from STMD echoed the opinion of SpaceX in that it was a successful demo. It's the first step in being able to conduct a ship-to-ship propellant transfer, one of the main components of the SpaceX mission for Artemis moon landings.\n\nSpaceX's concept is to launch a tanker version of the ship upper stage into low Earth orbit. They would then launch a series of ships to dock with the tanker and transfer propellant into it, which would in turn, shift that over to the HLS version of Starship before it heads off to the Moon.\n\n\"Prop transfer is really the key to the portal to the rest of the universe. It genuinely is. It's the key to Mars, it's the key to the South Pole and really, that is our long pole and we're doing all we can to get ready for that, to help SpaceX with that,\" Watson-Morgan said. \"In addition, we're doing all we can to help Blue Origin with it because they have that as well in their concept.\"\n\nThe number of fueling flights heading up to the tanker doesn't have a hard and fast number at this point, Watson-Morgan said, because it's not entirely clear how much propellant needs to be transferred.\n\n\"It's contingent on the six of the tanks. It's contingent on how much how much do we want to transfer. It's contingent on what all are the other objectives that we want to prove out and how long do we want to make the demonstration of the flight test?\" Watson-Morgan said. \"And so, it could be just a couple and it could be more than a couple. And so, it all depends on our objectives.\"\n\n\"One thing that I appreciate much about SpaceX is that they are willing to be open and fluid with objectives and open to more objectives, if NASA believes we need them, depending on the timing.\"\n\nWhile she was limited on what she could say about it, Watson-Morgan also mentioned that SpaceX is developing a smaller thruster-style engine to help with the prop transfer demonstration. She said a development milestone on that is coming up later this year.\n\n\"Our team has been very impressed. They've developed this engine within less than half a year and it's, so far, been performing well,\" she said.\n\nPart of the timing for the propellant transfer will hinge on being able to launch multiple Starship missions from more than the one launch tower SpaceX currently has. The company is in the process of building a second tower down at Starbase.\n\nTo that end, they manufactured additional segments and components at their facilities at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida and have barged them down to Texas. A collection of four tower segments shipped earlier this year and this week, they loaded two more segments onto the barge, along with the tower's so-called \"chopsticks\" and their elevator system supports.\n\nWatson-Morgan said the propellant transfer mission could be conducted from two towers at Starbase, but NASA is very interested in making sure that Starship launch capabilities come online at KSC as well. Next week, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will host public scoping meetings to gather input on allowing around 44 Starship launches per year from historic Launch Complex 39A.\n\nSimultaneously, the Department of the Air Force is also doing a similar assessment for Starship launches from either Space Launch Complex 37, which is the former launch site of United Launch Alliance's (ULA) Delta 4 Heavy rocket, or from a proposed new launch pad called SLC-50.\n\n\"We definitely want to see that. We have to see it by the uncrewed demo for sure and clearly, we'd like to see that before to make sure that everything checks out,\" Watson-Morgan said. \"We will go ahead and have pad checkouts and all that and operational readiness reviews in advance of it.\"\n\nPart of SpaceX's HLS agreement with NASA is that it will perform an uncrewed landing of Starship on the Moon prior to the Artemis 3 mission.\n\nAs they're developing the human-rated version of Starship, they're also gathering input from Astronaut Office, which is located at NASA's Johnson Space Center. Watson-Morgan, referring to them as \"the crew\" for shorthand, said the office offers insight and opinions on the functionality of certain parts of the vehicle, like interface, control system and location of handles.\n\nShe said the HLS office mainly works with astronauts Raja Chari and Randy Bresnik, the latter of whom has been a part of the process \"since the very beginning.\" Watson-Morgan said that they also have members of the astronaut office on their control board.\n\n\"We have a Human Landing System control board, where any requirements changes or updates or how things are implemented get to go through their formal board actions and the crew's a voting member,\" she said.\n\nOn April 30, at the SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California, NASA astronaut Doug \"Wheels\" Wheelock and Axiom Space astronaut Peggy Whitson performed the first integrated test of Axiom's pressurized spacesuits alongside mockups of a Starship elevator and the airlock.\n\n\"Overall, I was pleased with the astronauts' operation of the control panel and with their ability to perform the difficult tasks they will have to do before stepping onto the Moon,\" said Logan Kennedy, lead for surface activities in NASA's HLS Program, in a statement. \"The test also confirmed that the amount of space available in the airlock, on the deck, and in the elevator, are sufficient for the work our astronauts plan to do.\"\n\nThrough the Starship test campaign, SpaceX achieve shorter and shorter turnaround times between launches. That's partly due to accomplishing more each time in a less destructive way, but also thanks to work being doing by the FAA.\n\nFlight 2 came just 212 days after Flight 1, Flight 3 was 117 days after Flight 2 and Flight 4 comes just 84 days after Flight 3. Watson-Morgan said her understanding is that SpaceX would like to reach a monthly launch cadence at Starbase, but knows that they'll want to infuse the learning of previous flights into successive ones, which may take more time.\n\n\"Even if it's every two to three months, that's still quite an achievement for a test campaign and each one of these tests will buy down different risks,\" Watson-Morgan said. \"For a NASA standpoint, seeing each one of those launches, we'll get a little deeper insight into how all the engines act, how they're performing, with respect to the ISP (specific impulse) and so, we will have that.\"\n\nIn its approval of the launch license modification allowing for Flight 4, the FAA said that SpaceX gave it three scenarios for Starship entry at the end of the mission \"that would not require an investigation in the event of the loss of the vehicle.\"\n\n\"The FAA approved the scenarios as test induced damage exceptions after evaluating them as part of the flight safety and flight hazard analyses and confirming they met public safety requirements,\" the agency said in a statement. \"If a different anomaly occurs with the Starship vehicle an investigation may be warranted as well as if an anomaly occurs with the Super Heavy booster rocket.\"\n\nThat language, coupled with a good performance of Flight 4 could open the door for a much faster announcement of a Flight 5 mission.", "source": {"uri": "spaceflightnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spaceflight Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A stuck roll control valve during reentry caused a total loss of the vehicle at an altitude of 65 km (40 miles). The IFT-4 iteration of Starship included more maneuvering thrusters and flaps for greater control and stability.\n\nThey worked. Man, did they ever work. Or maybe the Ship simply flew better and didn't require the extra control. SpaceX will know soon enough as they examine the flight data.\n\nNow, about that re-entry...\n\nASIDE: I noticed something today that might be new or at least just new to me. The second stage is called Starship and the first stage is called Super Heavy, but the full stack -- Starship on top of Super Heavy -- is also called Starship. Today, I heard the hosts refer to the second stage as \"Ship.\" I'll probably end up referring to the second stage as both.\n\nThe mission profile was to launch from Starbase in Texas, attempt deorbit and landing burns for Super Heavy (for a non-recoverable water landing in the Gulf of Mexico), while the Ship would enter space for a partial orbital flight before attempting a de-orbit burn and re-entry.\n\nThe goal of today's Ship reentry was to not burn up. If they could manage to relight the engines for a landing burn in the Indian Ocean (not a recoverable landing!), that would be the icing on the world's most extravagant cake.\n\nIt. Was. Extraordinary.\n\nWe got incredible exterior views courtesy of a 4K camera, live-streamed via SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service. (Full Disclosure: I'm a customer.) The camera's view included one of the flaps used to orient the Ship once back in the Earth's atmosphere. The Ship lit up in the plasma field created by the heat of reentry. The heat tiles held. A few heat tiles (in the least hot areas) were purposely left off for testing purposes. The Ship reached maximum heat as it reentered, but then something went wrong.\n\nIt was obvious even to my untrained eye that the flap started burning up at the root where it was attached to the Ship.\n\nAnd yet the Ship held together. Stuff was burning up, flying off, the camera lens became clouded and then finally cracked from all the debris. But somehow Starship held together. Even with at least one control flap apparently entirely burned away, the Ship managed to orient itself for landing, and the landing engines lit up for a perfectly (???) controlled water landing. The telemetry all looked good.\n\nRecommended: The Great Crusade Was Greater Than You Know\n\nOne of the most remarkable parts had nothing to do with the Super Heavy booster or the Ship. Except for three or four brief signal losses, Starlink just kind of casually maintained a hi-def live stream through the entire deorbit cycle, including through a plasma field. Wow.\n\nWhatever went wrong with that flap (and perhaps others we couldn't see), SpaceX will identify the problem, correct for the problem, and test again on IFT-5.\n\nBut before any of that excitement happened, Super Heavy performed better than ever. Only 32 of the 33 engines lit off but it has enough excess thrust -- by design -- to complete a mission with multiple engine failures at launch. More importantly, Super Heavy did exactly what IFT-4 called on it to do: relight engines for a successful de-boost burn, then relight again for a landing burn.\n\nSuper Heavy \"landed,\" as it were, in the Gulf of Mexico more or less perfectly.\n\nJust in terms of the mission profile, IFT-4 achieved everything SpaceX had hoped for and, with the Ship's controlled water landing, more.\n\nBut there's more to come.\n\nThe Associated Press put the worst possible spin on IFT-4, headlining their writeup with \"SpaceX's mega rocket completes its fourth test flight from Texas without exploding.\" But the mission accomplished so much more than that.

Starliner will have a first go at with its third launch attempt on Wednesday. The Boeing spacecraft has had issues for over a month now in getting its first crewed mission off the ground, literally. Both launch day scrubs have not been because of Starliner, however, but because of its rocket, ULA's Atlas V.\n\nLike all crewed missions, flight rules for rocket's ability to launch are heightened so this leads to more scrubs than usual.\n\nStarship's launch date is still up in the air, currently it has the ability to launch with the FAA stating another launch would not pose a safety risk to the public. But SpaceX has yet to gain permission to launch with a new amendment to its license for another launch.\n\nSpaceX has conducted a full wet dress rehearsal and we're just waiting on more signs that SpaceX will be attempting the launch on Thursday. So far, there's nothing that shows they won't.\n\nOh yes, Virgin Galactic might be launching too this week!

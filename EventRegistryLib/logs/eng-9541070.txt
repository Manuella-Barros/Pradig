He had contracted the Indian fishermen by issuing them Iranian visas for fishing off the coast of Iran in his boat since March 26, 2023. The fishermen alleged that the sponsor had ill-treated them and had not provided them basic living conditions. They also said that their passports were all taken away by him.

They were provided relief. The crew told the Coastal Police that they had left Iran on April 22 and reached the coast of Kerala late on Sunday.\n\nThey were interrogated by various security agencies before being handed over to the Coastal Police. According to a source, the fishermen said they had left India on valid visa but were without their passports now after they were confiscated by their sponsor.\n\nThe legal process, said an official, involved producing them for immigration clearance to record their entry to India.

An officer interviewed the boat's captain, Steven Giffin, and was told only two people were onboard on leisure fishing. But the Coast Guard crew allegedly noticed the fishing rods lacked reels and were not the kind used for catching tuna.\n\nThe Coast Guard also interviewed Jonathan Brent Salter, the boat's other occupant, who told officers he had been working on the engine; further questioning allegedly revealed that the vessel had met with another boat in Mexico \"to pick up people,\" records show.\n\nThe Coast Guard notified the Border Patrol about a possible human smuggling encounter and instructed the captain to steer toward the U.S. Coast Guard Station in San Diego. Records show that in addition to Giffin and Salterborder, border agents found 13 people in the boat, including a previously deported Mexican national and a Romanian named Mihail Enasoeai. None of the foreign nationals had documents allowing their legal stay in the United States.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, material witnesses told investigators they paid between $1,000 and $13,000 to be picked up by a small boat near Rosarito Beach, Mexico, and taken out to sea to meet a larger vessel.

The vessel was seized by Iran's military on April 13, triggering international concern.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Amir Abdollahian, in a conversation with his Estonian counterpart Margus Tsahkna, disclosed the release of the crew, including the sole woman cadet among the Indian crew members, Ann Tessa Joseph. The Iranian foreign ministry indicated that the crew's release was carried out on humanitarian grounds.\n\nResponding to inquiries regarding the detained vessel, Abdollahian highlighted that the ship posed a security risk by turning off its radar in Iranian territorial waters. Despite this, Iran released all crew members, expressing willingness for their safe return home, contingent upon the ship's captain accompanying them.\n\nThe detained ship's crew comprised nationals from India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Russia, and Estonia.

This incident underscores the ICG's ongoing efforts to safeguard India's maritime borders and maintain law and order in Maritime Zones of India.\n\nDuring the operation, heightened security level was maintained by ICG units coordinated by ICGS Abhinav, which launched its boarding party to investigate the boat. The boarding operation revealed that the fishing boat is of Iranian nationality with 06 crew who were all of Indian Nationality. The boat was thoroughly checked by ICG team to check for boat's involvement in any anti- national activity.\n\nThe initial investigations divulged that the boat is owned by an Iranian sponsor named Syed Saud Ansari, who had contracted 06 Indian fishermen (from Kanyakumari region in Tamilnadu) by issuing them Iranian Visas for fishing off Iran Coast in his boat since 26 Mar 23.\n\nThe crew stated that the sponsor had been ill treating them since the day they were hired and has not provided them with basic living conditions. Further they had also alleged the sponsor for having confiscated their passports. The crew subsequently decided to escape from Iran to India using the same boat, where they were working as fishermen.\n\nThe Indian Coast Guard always demonstrates unwavering commitment towards ensuring the safety and security of India's coastal waters. With vigilance as its cornerstone, the ICG tirelessly patrols the vast expanse of maritime territory, safeguarding against threats ranging from piracy to illegal fishing and smuggling.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fishing vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_Dhruv", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HAL Dhruv"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beypore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beypore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beypore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kochi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kochi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maritime security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralty_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Admiralty law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_boundary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maritime boundary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanyakumari", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kanyakumari"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kanyakumari"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal,_unreported_and_unregulated_fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smuggling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-01/788c2474-d92c-4646-8989-f2b9b1bf005d/image_123650291.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541070", "eventUri": "eng-9541070", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-23", "textStart": 1602, "textEnd": 1608}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

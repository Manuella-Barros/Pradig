{"id": 223813330, "title": "Naomi Osaka beats nerves to knock Lucia Bronzetti out of French Open", "text": "The closer Naomi Osaka edged towards her first grand slam title win in more than two years, the more she found herself unable to play with the freedom she craved. From 4-0 up in the third set of her French Open first-round match against Lucia Bronzetti, a match largely decided on her racket, Osaka\u2019s nerves began to wreak havoc. She soon found herself on the verge of a crushing defeat. When she truly needed to step up, though, Osaka steadied herself and recovered. After three turbulent sets, she moved into the second round with a 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 victory. Despite the tight result, Osaka did demonstrate some periods of genuine quality against the world No 67. She was excellent in the opening set, serving well and crushing the ball with ease, then she established a 4-0 lead in the final set with similarly dominant play. But those positive moments were bookended by nervous, error-strewn periods as the 26-year-old\u2019s feet became rooted to the ground and her errors missed the court by dramatic margins. To her credit, while trailing 4-5 in the final set after losing five successive games, Osaka steadied herself with some excellent serving and she rolled through the final three games to advance. The victory marks Osaka\u2019s first win in a grand slam match since January 2022, when she reached the third round of the Australian Open. Afterwards, she said her desperation to finally advance past the first round was the primary reason for her nerves. \u201cThat was exactly the reason,\u201d Osaka said. \u201cI was in my head, thinking I didn\u2019t win a match in Australia so I\u2019d really love to win one here. Obviously that wasn\u2019t a good train of thought. I kind of focused on it a bit too much instead of trying to play point by point, and I think towards the end I was able to erase that thought from my head. But I would love to not have to go through that rollercoaster again.\u201d Since returning from maternity leave at the beginning of the year, Osaka has had to accept gradual progress rather than immediately blazing through the draws and re-establishing her level of old. This seemed to be another of those moments, another small step forward. Perhaps she will feel more composed the next time she is charged with closing out a grand-slam match. During her press conference on Saturday, questions about the draw prompted a suspicious Osaka to ask, with a chuckle, that reporters not reveal any potential opponents beyond the first round. Now she knows. By beating Bronzetti, Osaka has done her part of the deal ahead of a potential second-round match against Iga Swiatek, the top seed and tournament favourite. Swiatek will open her tournament on Monday against Leolia Jeanjean, a qualifier from France. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t really know [Swiatek was a potential opponent],\u201d Osaka said. \u201cBut then after, I was like: \u2018Why does everyone keep asking me about this draw?\u2019 I knew that I was in the top half, so I was like, jokingly: \u2018Well, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m playing Iga.\u2019 Then everyone got quiet. \u201cI\u2019m honestly really excited. I watched her a lot when I was pregnant. I think it\u2019s an honour to play her in the French Open, because she\u2019s won more than once here. It\u2019s like a very big honour and challenge for me.\u201d While Osaka\u2019s prospects of challenging Swiatek may be remote based on her opening performance, if the pair face each other she will at least have the benefit of playing against the world No 1 fully aware that the pressure will all be on the other side. It is a free hit, a chance for Osaka to impose herself and see where she stacks up against the best player in the world. But first, Swiatek must complete her part of the job. \u201c[I\u2019m] taking it as an experience and kind of knowing that I feel like I\u2019m the underdog, and I think I thrive in those situations,\u201d Osaka said. \u201cSo if I do play her, I\u2019d be really excited to.\u201d Jelena Ostapenko, the ninth seed, reached the second round with a 6-4, 7-5 win against Jaqueline Cristian of Romania.", "summary": "<ul><li>Former world No 1 into second round after 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 victory</li><li>Osaka could face Swiatek after first grand slam win since 2022</li></ul><p>The closer Naomi Osaka edged towards her first grand slam title win in more than two years, the more she found herself unable to play with the freedom she craved.

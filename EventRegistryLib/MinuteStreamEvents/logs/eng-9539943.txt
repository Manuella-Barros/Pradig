At 14, he left for Kosofe Secondary School, Mile 12 in Lagos.\n\nAfter his secondary education, Gbagi worked with a Foreign Service before travelling abroad to further his education. While in Hong Kong, he shot a movie titled The Birth of Hong Kong in 1993. This gave him some money to pay his tuition fee at Sans Thomas University in the Philippines, where he read political science. He left Sans Thomas University and graduated as a criminologist from the Philippine College of Criminology.\n\nGbagi returned to Nigeria for his National Youth Service (NYSC) and served at the Police College in Ikeja, where he taught criminology.\n\nHe later went back to School and made distinction at the faculty of law, University of Lagos. He was the youngest lawyer ever to head the Legal Aid Council of Nigeria.\n\nHis investments in Nigeria include GKO Group of Companies, Geekos Investments, Signatious Hotels, and Robinson Shopping

May his soul rest in perfect peace\", the statement added.\n\nGbagi was born in Sapele, Delta State in a Catholic hospital by the Cemetery at Ogodo Road. He attended Bishop Johnson Memory Primary School also in Sapele.\n\nKenneth was born into a polygamous home where his father decided that only the first child of each wife, out of his 21 children, will be sent to school. Being his mother's third child, he wasn't sent to school by his father. Kenneth struggled to pay his way to school by doing the worst of odd jobs only boys of his age with his drive could do.\n\nHe left home at the age of 11 to become a sailor. After completing his primary education, he landed in Argentina, traveled to Montevideo and some other countries. But his thirst for education prompted his return to Nigeria where he succeeded in enrolling in a secondary school even when his mates were already in class 3.\n\nThe ex-minister was already 14 years old when he attended Kosofe Secondary School, Mile 12. Interestingly enough, he sponsored himself to secondary school through working as a bus conductor.\n\nUpon finishing his secondary education, Kenneth worked with Foreign Service before travelling abroad to further his education. While in Hong Kong, he shot a movie titled, \"The birth of Hong Kong in 1993.\" This gave him some money to pay his tuition fee.\n\nHe gained admission into one of the oldest universities in the world, Sans Thomas University in Philippines, to read political science. He left Sans Thomas University and graduated as a criminologist from the Philippine College of Criminology. He returned to Nigeria for his National Youth Service. He served with the Police Force and taught many important persons in the Police Force.", "source": {"uri": "leadership.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Leadership"}, "authors": [{"uri": "felix_igbekoyi@leadership.ng", "name": "Felix Igbekoyi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Education minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapele,_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sapele, Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_(Nigeria)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Niger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Order of the Niger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_magnate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business magnate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delta State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delta State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polygamy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosofe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kosofe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kosofe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_College_of_Criminology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippine College of Criminology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montevideo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montevideo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/High_School_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/High School Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kenneth-Omemavwa-Gbagi.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539943", "eventUri": "eng-9539943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

According to several reports, he died in a Lagos State hospital after a brief illness.\n\nDetails are still very sketchy about his death as at the time of filing this report.\n\nThe 62-year-old criminologist and attorney of the Nigerian bar was the governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the 2023 gubernatorial election in Delta State and a former Minister of State for Education.\n\nBorn in Sapele, Delta State, in a Catholic hospital by the Cemetery at Ogodo Road on September 22, 1961, Gbagi attended Bishop Johnson Memory Primary School, Sapele. At 14, he left for Kosofe Secondary School, Mile 12 in Lagos.\n\nAfter his secondary education, Gbagi worked with a Foreign Service before travelling abroad to further his education. While in Hong Kong, he shot a movie titled The Birth of Hong Kong in 1993. This gave him some money to pay his tuition fee at Sans Thomas University in the Philippines, where he read political science. He left Sans Thomas University and graduated as a criminologist from the Philippine College of Criminology.\n\nGbagi returned to Nigeria for his National Youth Service (NYSC) and served at the Police College in Ikeja, where he taught criminology.\n\nHe later went back to School and made distinction at the faculty of law, University of Lagos. He was the youngest lawyer ever to head the Legal Aid Council of Nigeria.\n\nHis investments in Nigeria include GKO Group of Companies, Geekos Investments, Signatious Hotels, and Robinson Shopping Plaza in Warri.", "source": {"uri": "thenewsguru.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheNewsGuru"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emman_ovuakporie@thenewsguru.com", "name": "Emman Ovuakporie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minister of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_State", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delta State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delta State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapele,_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sapele, Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lagos State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosofe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kosofe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kosofe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_(Nigeria)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Bar_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian Bar Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Lagos", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Lagos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Youth_Service_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Youth Service Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikeja", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ikeja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ikeja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools_of_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools of Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://thenewsguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/images-31.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539943", "eventUri": "eng-9539943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

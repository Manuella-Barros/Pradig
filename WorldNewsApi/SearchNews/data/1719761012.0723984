Anthony Junior Bishop of no fixed place of abode, formerly of Chapman Village, St Thomas, was not required to plead to the indictable charge of wounding Cuthbert Harewood with intent to cause serious bodily harm on May 22. He also faces a charge of using unlawful violence towards Harewood that caused others to fear for their personal safety in the attack. Objecting to bail, prosecutor Sargeant Ralph Rollock cited the seriousness of the offence, the use of a cutlass, the need to protect society, the accused man\u2019s lack of address, and the strength of the evidence. The prosecutor told Magistrate Alison Burke in the District \u2018A\u2019 Traffic Court the complainant was still in hospital. He then pointed out that the accused was already on bail from the court and two others on offences which were similar in nature and had missed several court dates. Bishop claimed he missed one of the dates because he was in jail.", "summary": "<p>Already on bail for three similar offences, a 25-year-old man has been remanded to Dodds Prison until June 25 over a chopping incident in The City last week.

He\u2019s really chomping at the bit to take the governor off, so to speak.\u201d Berry noted that Watson, who ripped two passes of at least 50 yards on the final day of minicamp, looks no worse for the wear and tear from two separate shoulder injuries, including the early strained rotator cuff, that cost him 11 games last season. \u201cHe\u2019s had a really nice spring,\u201d Berry said. \u201cHe\u2019s thrown the ball well. He did a really nice job during our 7-on-7 and team periods during this veteran minicamp. So we\u2019re excited as he gets into training camp and we get the pads on, but he\u2019s making excellent progress. And honestly, if you didn\u2019t know he got hurt last year, you really wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference. So we\u2019re very excited once camp starts.\u201d Kevin Stefanski has said that Watson \u201clooks like himself\u201d and that the deep passes with excellent velocity \u201clook normal to me,\u201d but it Berry\u2019s evaluation was the first time anyone in the organization has said he\u2019s ahead of schedule. To this point, the company line has been that he\u2019s exactly where he\u2019s supposed to be. But it was evident in minicamp that Watson was throwing extremely hard and putting the ball on the money most of the time. Granted, he was throwing only every other day and didn\u2019t work against the defense until minicamp \u2014 and then only in 7-on-7s and not 11-on-11s \u2014 but he looked like he could step out and start a game tomorrow if he had to. That\u2019s great news for the Browns, who are counting on Watson to help lead the Browns to the Super Bowl this season, his third with the club. Next up for Watson is to host his offensive teammates likely in Miami for a passing camp like he\u2019s done in each of the past two seasons. He\u2019ll then step up his program during training camp, which begins July 25th at The Greenbrier resort in West Va.", "summary": "Browns GM Andrew Berry said Deshaun Watson is ahead of schedule coming out of minicamp.", "url": "https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2024/06/browns-andrew-berry-on-deshaun-watson-coming-out-of-minicamp-hes-ahead-of-schedule.html", "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/JFKVMRBN35HQ3KBXIMW2XD6NBA.JPG?auth=625a6c4b148837b9a97f0eb15447592d07a1b50264c3b902979b428fd9ca591f&width=1280&quality=90", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:43:39", "author": "Mary Kay Cabot,Mary Kay Cabot, Cleveland.com", "authors": ["Mary Kay Cabot", "Mary Kay Cabot, Cleveland.com"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.08}

Officers were speaking with him at the hospital to get more information about what happened, the sheriff said.\n\nThe skiers hiked into the area Thursday morning, she said.\n\nLone Peak is one of the highest peaks in the Wasatch Range towering over Utah's capital city. Its steep, rugged terrain makes it a popular destination for advanced backcountry skiers, and experienced climbers can be found scaling its sheer granite walls in the warmer months.\n\nThe slide happened in the Big Willow Cirque, said Craig Gordon with the Utah Avalanche Center.\n\n\"This is very serious terrain. It's steep. It's north-facing. The crew that was up there would have to be experienced,\" Gordon said.\n\nAbout 2.5 feet (76 centimeters) of heavy, wet snow fell in the area in the past three days during storms that also brought very strong winds, he said.\n\n\"With spring, avalanche conditions can change in an instant,\" Gordon said.\n\nThe deaths bring this winter's tally of avalanche deaths to at least 15, which is less than the average of about 30 people who are killed by avalanches in the U.S. each year. The Colorado Avalanche Information Center, which keeps track of the figure nationally, tallied 13 deaths before authorities announced Thursday's fatalities.\n\nHanson reported from Helena, Montana.

The company will be owned by the British people, for the British people, backed with \u00a38.3 billion of new money over this Parliament to own and invest in clean power projects in regions across the UK.\n\nIt comes soon after the Energy Secretary has scrapped the ban on onshore wind and unblocked the production of cheap solar energy. Today's announcement is yet more evidence of the Energy Secretary rolling up his sleeves to deliver clean energy and kickstart economic growth, so British bill payers and communities reap the benefits of clean, secure, home-grown energy.\n\nGreat British Energy's first major partnership will be between two national institutions for the benefit of the British people. The Crown Estate, which has a \u00a316 billion portfolio of land and seabed, operates independently and returns its profits to the government, brings long-established expertise to the partnership, and new investment and borrowing powers recently announced by government. Great British Energy will bring the critical strategic industrial policy that the state can provide, as well as its own ability to invest.\n\nThe Crown Estate estimates this partnership will lead to up to 20-30GW of new offshore wind developments reaching seabed lease stage by 2030, enough power for the equivalent of almost 20 million homes.\n\nThe partnership will boost Britain's energy independence by investing in homegrown power, and with accompanying reforms to policy, cut the time it takes to get offshore wind projects operating and delivering power to homes by up to half.\n\nThis partnership will see the public sector taking on a new role undertaking additional early development work for offshore wind projects. This will ensure that future offshore wind development has lower risk for developers, enabling projects to build out faster after leasing and crowding in private sector investment. It will also help boost new technologies such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, wave and tidal energy.\n\nIt comes as the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has published details of the company's objective. Families across the country have suffered during the cost-of-living crisis, as the UK's over-reliance on fossil fuel markets was exploited by Putin. Great British Energy is part of the government's plans for clean power by 2030, so families and businesses are never left vulnerable again to spiking global prices.\n\nThe Prime Minister has confirmed that Great British Energy will be headquartered in Scotland and will back energy generation projects in the UK, bringing profits back to the British people. The UK Government is in discussions with the Scottish Government and\u202fCrown Estate Scotland on how Great British Energy could help to support new development and investment within Scotland.\n\nThe government is already legislating to give both Great British Energy and The Crown Estate the powers they need to rapidly deliver, with two Bills being introduced in Parliament today.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer said:\n\nMy government is laser focused on delivering change, to make people better off.\n\nThis innovative partnership between Great British Energy and the Crown Estate is an important step toward our mission for clean energy by 2030, and bringing down energy bills for good.\n\nThis agreement will drive up to \u00a360 billion in investment into the sector, turbocharging our country toward energy security, the next generation of skilled jobs, and lowering bills for families and business.\n\nMy mission led government is rolling up our sleeves to deliver for Britain.\n\nEnergy Security and Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband said:\n\nGreat British Energy comes from a simple idea - that the British people should own and benefit from our natural resources. Investing in clean power is the route to end the UK's energy insecurity, and Great British Energy will be essential in this mission.\n\nThe agreement with The Crown Estate will lead to more investment, cleaner power, more energy security, and is a statement of intent that it will be a permanent and transformative institution for our country.\n\nChief Executive of the Crown Estate Dan Labbad said:\n\nThe Crown Estate exists to serve the national interest, including stewarding our natural resources to deliver a decarbonised, energy secure and sustainable future.\n\nWith new powers and by partnering with government, we can drive greater investment into this future for our country, and with it support nature recovery and job creation.\n\nGreat British Energy will have five key functionsProject development - leading projects through development stages to speed up their delivery, whilst capturing more value for the British public Project investment - investing in energy projects alongside the private sector, helping get them off the ground Local Power Plan - supporting local energy generation projects through working with local authorities, combined authorities and communities Supply chains - building supply chains across the UK, boosting energy independence and creating jobs Great British Nuclear - exploring how\u202fGreat British Energy and\u202fGreat British Nuclear will work together, including considering how\u202fGreat British Nuclear functions will fit with\u202fGreat British Energy\n\nThe Crown Estate has already helped the UK to become a global leader in the offshore wind sector, and is currently running one of the world's largest commercial scale floating wind leasing programmes in the Celtic sea. This partnership will accelerate that leadership even further.\n\nThe Great British Energy Bill, which is being introduced in the House of Commons today, will support the creation of the new publicly owned company by setting out its objectives and ensuring it has access to necessary finances. The Secretary of State will also have the ability to set Great British Energy's strategic priorities to ensure it remains focussed on the government's aim to accelerate the delivery of homegrown clean energy power in the UK.\n\nThe Crown Estate Bill will modernise The Crown Estate by removing outdated restrictions on its activities so it can, for example, invest in digital technologies that will further enhance its award-winning spatial mapping of the seabed. The Bill will also expand The Crown Estate's investment powers and grant borrowing capabilities, unlocking significant investment in public infrastructure. This includes essential marine investment to help support the acceleration and growth of offshore wind capacity by 2030 alongside supporting the regeneration of urban centres, such as its most recent example of a new Life Science partnership in central Oxford and nature recovery across its portfolio. These reforms will secure the continued future success of the Crown Estate business and maximise the returns it generates for the public.\n\nThe announcements follow the government's rapid action to set up a new Mission Control at the heart of government to deliver clean power by 2030, headed up by former Climate Change Committee chief executive Chris Stark.\n\n/Public Release.

Capitalisation of \u00a38.3 billion has been promised in the current parliamentary session.\n\nThe Government says it will have five key functions, including project investment and building up supply chains.\n\nAhead of the Bill's introduction, the Prime Minister said: \"Scotland will lead the clean energy revolution in the United Kingdom, fuelled by the skills, knowledge, and talented workforce the energy sector here contains.\n\n\"That's why we're headquartering GB Energy in Scotland, and today's announcement takes us a step closer to achieving that.\n\n\"Clean energy by 2030, cheaper bills, and good jobs across the country.\"\n\nScottish Secretary Ian Murray said: \"Scotland is the powerhouse of our clean energy mission and Great British Energy will drive forward investment in home-grown energy production and provide benefits to bill payers.\n\n\"Greater energy security through Great British Energy will mean less reliance on overseas fossil fuels, boosting our economy and creating more jobs.\n\n\"We are also focused on cleaner energy and getting renewables projects online quicker, which is key for our journey to net zero.\n\n\"I am pleased we are working closely with the Scottish Government to ensure these benefits are felt by people right across the UK.\"\n\nTrade body Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) welcomed the tie up between the Crown Estate and the much-anticipated GB Energy.\n\nIt highlighted that the new government now needs partnerships with industry to put plans into action and kickstart economic growth.

This aims to ensure that offshore wind development has lower risk for developers, enabling projects to build out faster after leasing and crowding in private sector investment. It will also help boost new technologies such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, wave and tidal energy.\n\nThe Prime Minister has confirmed that GB Energy will be headquartered in Scotland and will back energy generation projects in the UK, bringing profits back to the British people. The UK Government is in discussions with the Scottish Government and Crown Estate Scotland on how GB Energy could help to support new development and investment within Scotland.\n\nSir Keir said: \"My government is laser-focused on delivering change, to make people better off.\n\n\"This innovative partnership between Great British Energy and the Crown Estate is an important step toward our mission for clean energy by 2030, and bringing down energy bills for good.\"\n\nMr Miliband said: \"Great British Energy comes from a simple idea - that the British people should own and benefit from our natural resources. Investing in clean power is the route to end the UK's energy insecurity, and Great British Energy will be essential in this mission.\n\n'The agreement with The Crown Estate will lead to more investment, cleaner power, more energy security, and is a statement of intent that it will be a permanent and transformative institution for our country.\"\n\nOffshore Energies UK said the partnership is a \"logical step on the government's planned path to net zero.

Investing in clean power is the route to end the UK's energy insecurity, and Great British Energy will be essential in this mission.\n\n\"The agreement with The Crown Estate will lead to more investment, cleaner power, more energy security, and is a statement of intent that it will be a permanent and transformative institution for our country.\"\n\nBut the Conservative Party accused Labour of having put \"ideology above the national interest\".\n\nShadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho said: \"The public has been sold a lie that a Labour government will cut their energy bills by \u00a3300. Now that they've won the election they've tried to brush that figure under the carpet, showing us the truth that GB Energy is nothing but a gimmick that will end up costing families, not cutting bills.\n\n\"Labour have already been forced to admit that their flagship energy company won't generate any energy, and now we know it's a financial black hole - funnelling taxpayer's money into reducing risk for multi-million-pound energy companies.\"\n\nShe added: \"Labour's entire energy policy puts ideology above the national interest. Their absurd 2030 decarbonisation target will hike bills and ramp up our dependence on batteries and cables from China.\n\n\"They want to kneecap our domestic oil and gas production to import foreign fuel with higher carbon emissions.

enough to power almost 20 million homes.\n\nThe government claims it could leverage up to \u00a360bn of private investment into the country's energy infrastructure as a result.\n\nMinisters hope it will help towards achieving their goal of cutting energy bills at home, as well as helping the UK to become more self-sufficient when it comes to power.\n\nThe deal has been announced the same day the government will introduce legislation to create Great British Energy - a new publicly owned company, promised in Labour's manifesto, which will have \u00a38.3bn of funding over the next parliament.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"My government is laser focused on delivering change, to make people better off.\n\n\"This innovative partnership between Great British Energy and the Crown Estate is an important step toward our mission for clean energy by 2030, and bringing down energy bills for good.\"\n\nHe also said the partnership would \"turbocharge our country toward energy security, the next generation of skilled jobs, and lowering bills for families and business\", adding: \"My mission led government is rolling up our sleeves to deliver for Britain.\"\n\nThe Crown Estate is essentially the monarchy's property company, which has a \u00a316bn portfolio - including most of Britain's seabed up to 12 nautical miles from the land.\n\nIt made \u00a31.1bn in profit last year, the majority of which came from leasing land to offshore wind providers, and most of the money goes back into the government's coffers, bar a small portion which goes to the monarchy itself.\n\nIn another bill being introduced on Thursday, the Crown Estate will also be given new borrowing powers so it can invest more into wind projects.\n\nChief executive Dan Labbad said: \"The Crown Estate exists to serve the national interest, including stewarding our natural resources to deliver a decarbonised, energy secure and sustainable future.\n\n\"With new powers and by partnering with government, we can drive greater investment into this future for our country, and with it support nature recovery and job creation.\"\n\nOther details around Great British Energy were unveiled, with the government saying it would lead energy projects through development stages to make them go faster, then give them back to private firms, while keeping a stake to get a return for the public purse.\n\nHowever, ministers have left the door open for Great British Energy to become an operator of projects themselves in the future.\n\nGreenpeace UK called the announcement \"a great first step towards Labour delivering on their strong election mandate for rolling out renewable energy across the country\".\n\nBut shadow energy security secretary Claire Coutinho claimed Great British Energy was \"nothing but a gimmick that will end up costing families, not cutting bills\".\n\nShe added: \"Labour have already been forced to admit that their flagship energy company won't generate any energy, and now we know it's a financial black hole - funnelling taxpayers' money into reducing risk for multi-million-pound energy companies.\n\n\"Labour's entire energy policy puts ideology above the national interest... the Conservatives will hold them to account and make sure that the focus is on cheap bills and secure energy.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Estate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crown Estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Coutinho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Claire Coutinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenpeace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenpeace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural resource"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/24/03/1600x900/skynews-offshore-wind-uk-gwynt-y-mor_6481482.jpg?20240307103948", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761253", "eventUri": "eng-9761253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6705882352941177, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Perhaps nowhere more than when it comes to energy. Every person and business has paid the price of our country's energy insecurity. As Vladimir Putin sought to use energy as a weapon in his illegal invasion of Ukraine, bills went through the roof in a cost of living crisis unprecedented in modern times.\n\nAs the Climate Change Committee (CCC) recently made clear, there is one obvious answer to preventing us being so exposed again - a sprint for homegrown clean energy. As it said in its progress report to parliament last week: \"British-based renewable energy is the cheapest and fastest way to reduce vulnerability to volatile global fossil-fuel markets. The faster we get off fossil fuels, the more secure we become.\"\n\nBritain was left horribly exposed by years of underinvestment in its own supply and an overdependence on fossil fuels. With energy bills due to rise again in the autumn, according to independent forecasts, because of fossil-fuel prices, the challenges we face have not passed. The only way to protect ourselves as a country for the long term is to deliver cleaner, cheap, homegrown energy - boosting our energy independence, creating jobs and tackling the climate crisis.\n\nThat is why our mission to make Britain a clean-energy superpower, with a fully decarbonised power system by 2030, is so important - and there is not a moment to lose. Within a week of coming to power, the new government lifted the onshore windfarms ban, appointed the former head of the CCC, Chris Stark, to drive forward that clean-energy target, announced a rooftop solar-panel revolution and established a new national wealth fund with the chancellor for green investment.\n\nToday, we take the next steps. What was also clear from the election is how much the British people understood the case for Great British Energy, our new publicly owned energy company. In post-election polling by the organisation More in Common, Great British Energy enjoyed the support of 73% of all voters and 56% of 2024 Conservative voters.\n\nPeople recognise that this innovation can help drive cheaper, cleaner energy, create good jobs and growth, and generate wealth for the country. It is what our European neighbours have been doing for decades. A pragmatic, dynamic state partnering with the private sector to deliver for families and businesses.\n\nTo accelerate the action we need and make good on our election mandate, today we have introduced our legislation for Great British Energy and published an update statement for the organisation - and the prime minister is announcing an unprecedented partnership between Great British Energy and the crown estate.\n\nThe two organisations are coming together for the benefit of the nation with a new division called Great British Energy: The Crown Estate. The crown estate, which has a \u00a315.5bn portfolio of land and seabed, and returns its profits to the government, will bring its long established expertise, having enabled the UK to be a world leader in offshore wind. It will also have access to new borrowing powers recently announced by the government. As a publicly owned company, Great British Energy will provide the link to the government's strategic industrial policy objectives of investing in supply chains for the country.\n\nThis new partnership will help accelerate the deployment of the clean energy we need, help create good jobs in our country and generate wealth for the taxpayer.\n\nIt is an exemplar of the difference Great British Energy can make, working with the private sector to deploy new technologies. Currently, it can take years before a company can move its clean-energy project forward. Great British Energy will co-invest in new technologies, attracting private funding in areas including floating offshore windfarms, tidal power and hydrogen. It will also have the power to scale and accelerate mature technologies such as wind, solar and nuclear, partnering with existing private sector firms to speed up their deployment and meet ambitious timelines for delivery.\n\nIt will also work to scale up community energy projects - partnering with energy companies, local authorities and cooperatives to develop up to 8GW of small- and medium-scale projects.\n\nGreat British Energy will prove the case for 21st-century, modern public ownership - a dynamic state in partnership with workers, industry and unions, serving communities with cheap, clean and more secure energy, and we're doing it in a way that will deliver economic prosperity to every home, business and community across the UK.\n\nThe new government is under no illusions about the scale of the challenge we face. This is a long-term plan, not a quick fix, but we believe we can galvanise the whole country behind this mission.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

They will deliver few, if any, of the bold pledges they are making.\n\nLet me explain. In the King's Speech, Sir Keir's new government confirmed that GBE, the state-owned energy company, will develop, own and operate energy projects such as wind farms, using public money to help spur further private sector investment.\n\nKeir Starmer giving a speech on a visit to Hutchinson Engineering on July 25 (pictured). The Prime Minister hopes Great British Energy will develop projects and lower prices for the public\n\nEd Miliband (pictured on July 23) has taken over as Energy Secretary, promising to make Britain a clean energy 'superpower' by 2030 with home-grown clean energy\n\nBut the \u00a38.3 billion of seed money promised by the Exchequer for Britain's energy transformation over the term of the current parliament will be a drop in the ocean.\n\nIn spite of the overblown language, this is a fraction of the sums already devoted to 'climate reduction' goals by our UK-listed oil firms Shell and BP, as well as domestically owned power suppliers Centrica and Scottish & Southern Electricity (SSE).\n\nRead More How King Charles is expected to earn millions from Great British Energy deal\n\nSome argue it is reassuring that GBE will be headed up by the former boss of German multinational Siemens's British arm, Juergen Maier, who might bring some much-needed private-sector experience to the job.\n\nWhat is less reassuring, however, is the disastrous financial performance of Siemens Energy - which ran up losses of \u00a33.7 billion in 2023 alone.\n\nCombined with the desperate track record of past Labour governments to command and control the economy through grandiose quangos such as the National Enterprise Board of the 1970s, it looks almost inevitable that GBE will become yet another vast black hole, sucking in public cash at the expense of other strained public services.\n\nMost critically, by blocking future North Sea oil licences, as Starmer has done, and for the moment holding fire on the prospects for new nuclear production, the nation's energy security is being sacrificed in order to pursue unproven green energy 'solutions'.\n\nIn doing so, Starmer and Miliband are exposing the nation to the danger of factories being closed, the elderly and poor freezing in their homes - and lights going out when the wind fails to blow and the sun doesn't shine.\n\nIt is also critical that the UK can maintain a minimum level of electricity production at all times - especially if the Government pursues a madcap rush towards electric vehicles (EV) which, in many cases, are proving notoriously unreliable.\n\nThat is why Centrica-owned British Gas is investing heavily in renewing the nation's gas storage capacity at Rough off the East Yorkshire coast and exploring other potential sites in Wales.\n\nKing Charles (pictured July 11 in Cardiff) is also set to receive a major boost to his income from Great British Energy's deal with the Crown Estate\n\nSome argue it is reassuring that GBE will be headed up by the former boss of German multinational Siemens's British arm, Juergen Maier (pictured July 25 as Sir Keir gives a speech)\n\nNot to mention that Starmer and Miliband appear willing to trash 100,000 North Sea oil-related jobs, sabotage Aberdeen and lose \u00a330 billion of new investment in fossil fuels, and the engineering services which go with them, to drive the 'green revolution'.\n\nLabour believes that by signing an agreement yesterday with the Crown Estate - which has command over most of the nation's coastal waters - it can somehow magic up \u00a360 billion of new investment.\n\nRead More Fears Labour's push for Net Zero could endanger Britain's food security\n\nAdmittedly, this will be useful. Indeed, the link to the monarchy alone could potentially attract some overseas investors on the grounds of offering a kind of royal imprimatur. But we shouldn't get carried away by Labour's hoopla.\n\nThe Crown Estate has much more expertise on redeveloping real estate, such as the shops of London's swish Regent Street, than it does in energy.\n\nNor perhaps, are all of Miliband's eco-wheezes quite as revolutionary as he would have us believe. Before its new agreement with Labour, for example, the Crown Estate was already in talks with Scandinavian pioneers and Danish offshore energy experts.\n\nAnd despite the Crown Estate's prestigious reputation, the fact remains that the only thing that will attract investors is a competitive entry price. If the price at which energy generated at the offshore windfarms can be sold is set too low to make the projects viable, it will put off bidders.\n\nWe learnt this the hard way in a crucial auction late last year, when not a single company bid to run a new offshore wind farm. Why? Because the Tory government had set the energy price too low. Even more seriously, a major proposed investment off the coast of Norfolk was temporarily put on hold.\n\nThe same thing happened in the US last year when \u00d8rsted can-celled \u00a33.3 billion of wind projects because it could not make the returns.\n\nEarlier this year, BP also pulled out of its involvement in New York state wind farms - at a heavy cost to investors - because of the difficulty of getting decent returns.\n\nThe ultimate goal in all of these wind farms may have been lower prices for consumers. The reality is that only by offering a higher energy price to investors will they come forward - and the projects be built. It's an uncomfortable truth for Starmer and Miliband, who want to be seen to be providing the cheapest energy possible to voters.\n\nSir Starmer visiting the Beatrice wind farm off the Caithness Coast\n\nEd Miliband speaking ahead of Sir Keir Starmer during their visit to Hutchinson Engineering in Widnes\n\nA stock image of Gunfleet Sands' offshore wind farm as a Union Jack flies before them\n\nThey have been repeatedly questioned about when - or even if - their 'Green New Deal' would deliver lower prices for consumers. They couldn't answer. So much for cheaper bills.\n\nA secondary aim of GBE is to boost our manufacturing sector, creating new skills and new jobs to replace those in fossil fuels.\n\nRead More Labour is accused of 'lying' over pledge to knock \u00a3300 off bills\n\nThis may be a perfectly noble aim. But in Britain, we have already sold ourselves out. Most of the solar panels being installed on the roofs of homes and factories across the UK are being built in China at a fraction of the cost they can be made in the UK.\n\nOne only has to look at how Beijing is dominating the market for electric cars - and the 50 per cent tariffs erected in the US and Europe to slow imports - to understand how difficult it is going to be to compete with Asian production.\n\nThere also is evidence from pressure group Tech Transparency that Chinese suppliers of wind farm equipment are using cheap Uyghur labour to manufacture wind turbines. It will be all but impossible for UK manufacturers (currently responsible for less than 10 per cent of wind farm components) to compete.\n\nIt's not all bad news. There is one area of green technology where Britain has a competitive quality and engineering advantage. Rolls-Royce, with the assistance of government funding, leads the world in the development of 'small modular reactors'. These are mini, simple-to-construct nuclear reactors based on the turbines that power nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nEd Miliband smirking on during the speeches at the visit in Cheshire on Thursday\n\nAn image made by a drone shows wind turbines at a wind farm in Biggleswade\n\nRolls-Royce believes it is capable of capturing a \u00a3250 billion global market if it receives the go-ahead from Whitehall for UK production. The Czech Republic has already expressed interest in buying them.\n\nTens of thousands of real jobs - not the Potemkin quango roles envisaged by the new Government - are there to be created.\n\nSo far, however, Miliband has been slow to give the green light.\n\nWe can all pray for the success of Great British Energy and the zero-carbon nirvana envisaged by our mission-driven Government.\n\nBut I fear we are creating a taxpayer-funded white elephant which will decimate our energy security.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors":

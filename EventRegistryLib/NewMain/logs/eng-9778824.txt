She was just a teenager when she was cast in Raj Kapoor's 'Bobby' in the lead role opposite Rishi Kapoor. In an earlier interview, Dimple Kapadia spoke about how she got the role in 'Bobby', calling this era the most 'magical' of her life. Dimple Kapadia also made a shocking revelation and revealed that just before she bagged the role in 'Bobby', she was suffering from leprosy and a family friend, at the time, had threatened to get her \"ostracised\" from her school when she was just 12 years old.\n\nSpeaking to FICCI Flo Jaipur Chapter, Dimple Kapadia said that her father Chunnibhai Kapadia was influential and knew a 'famous director' who was like a friend of the family. Dimple Kapadia recalled how he was unkind to her. \"I was suffering from leprosy at that time. I was about 12 years old. I had it on my elbow. So this man turned around and said, 'I'll see that you get ostracised from school'. That was the first time I heard that word. I didn't even know what that meant,\" Dimple Kapadia said.\n\nBut, her medical condition proved to be a blessing in disguise for Dimple Kapadia as it led to her meeting Raj Kapoor. She said, \"Raj Kapoor wanted to meet this girl. He was told there is this beautiful girl and she is suffering from leprosy. Out of this kind of a setback, there was a lot to gain and that's how I got Bobby. It was the most fabulous time of my life. Anything that I said or wanted or desired, just happened. It was magical. Absolutely magical.\"\n\nBut before things worked out in her favour, Dimple Kapadia faced many hurdles. Raj Kapoor first rejected her for the role. \"I remember reading a newspaper in school which said that Raj Kapoor is looking for a girl for Bobby. I said to my friends 'I am Bobby'. Then I went for the test and I got rejected because he said 'You look much older than Chintu (Rishi Kapoor). Unn dino main kitab mein likti thi (Those days I would write in a notebook). I used to fill up my notebooks with Ram Ram Ram Ram. I thought aise kaise ho gaya yeh (How did this happen)?\"\n\nDimple Kapadia said that after rejecting her, Raj Kapoor called her again, after which things fell into place.\n\nFor the unversed, 'Bobby', starring Dimple Kapadia and Rishi Kapoor, was released in 1973 and went on to become a super hit. Both the debutants became overnight stars, thanks to the success that 'Bobby' enjoyed at the box office.\n\nBefore the release of 'Bobby', Dimple Kapadia got married to superstar Rajesh Khanna at the age of only 16. She gave birth to two daughters - Twinkle Khanna and Rinke Khanna. She separated from Rajesh Khanna after 10 years of marriage and then returned to films. Dimple Kapadia now plays minor roles in films. She was seen in Shah Rukh Khan's 'Pathaan' last year.", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimple_Kapadia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dimple Kapadia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raj_Kapoor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Raj Kapoor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Kapoor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Kapoor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaipur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaipur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jaipur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathaan_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathaan (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinke_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rinke Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Rukh_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shah Rukh Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twinkle_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twinkle Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajesh_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajesh Khanna"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2024/07/31/2643533-dimple-kapadia.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778824", "eventUri": "eng-9778824", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 238, "relevance": 1}

She recounted a traumatic experience from her childhood when a \"famous director\" who was a close family friend threatened to get her ostracized from school because she had leprosy. Dimple, who was only about 12 years old at the time, explained that this was the first time she had even heard the word \"ostracized\" and had to ask someone what it meant. The director's threat left a significant impact on her, but it also led to an unexpected opportunity.\n\nDimple Kapadia reveals how Leprosy led to her breakthrough role in Bobby\n\nTurning setback into opportunity\n\nDespite the threat and the stigma associated with leprosy, Dimple's condition eventually worked in her favor. During the same period, Raj Kapoor was on the lookout for a fresh face to play the lead in his upcoming film \"Bobby.\" Dimple's father, Chunnibhai Kapadia, was well-connected in the film industry and mentioned his daughter's situation to Kapoor. Intrigued by her story and her beauty, Raj Kapoor decided to cast her in the film. \"He was told there is this beautiful girl, and she is suffering from leprosy.

When she met Raj Kapoor, he told her, \"You look much older than Chintu (Rishi Kapoor).\" Disheartened by the comment, Dimple had her unique way of coping. She wrote \"Ram Ram Ram Ram\" repeatedly, trying to manifest a positive outcome despite the rejection. Fortunately, Raj Kapoor called her back for another audition, and this time, everything fell into place.\n\nThe magical journey of Bobby\n\nBobby marked the debut of Dimple Kapadia and Rishi Kapoor, and the film became an instant hit. Reflecting on those early years, Dimple described them as \"magical.\" She reminisced about how everything she aspired to seemed to fall into her lap effortlessly. The success of Bobby launched her into stardom, and she had a remarkable career in Bollywood. Dimple's story is a testament to turning adversities into opportunities and finding magic in the most unexpected places.\n\nLegacy and impact\n\nToday, at 67 years old, Dimple Kapadia looks back at her journey with gratitude. Her story of overcoming societal stigma and personal challenges to achieve success continues to inspire many. Bobby remains a classic in Indian cinema, and Dimple's performance is still remembered and celebrated.

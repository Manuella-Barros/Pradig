He took full advantage of his speed, his innovative moves and used the motivation of proving those doubters wrong all the way to a 16-year Hall of Fame career. He will be presented by Colts owner Jim Irsay, who is expected to be in a wheelchair after being injured in a fall.\n\n\"We all believed Dwight had the ability to be a force in the league,\" Polian told The Associated Press. \"The spin move was one Dwight executed perfectly and really perfected, so it was fine with us. But his base move was the bull rush, and he was so strong and fast he could run by most slow offensive tackles and guys who weren't as strong.\"\n\nPolian, the Hall of Fame executive, simply followed the plan.\n\nAfter creating the blueprint that produced four straight AFC titles in Buffalo, Polian spent his early years in Indianapolis putting together an offense around Peyton Manning. By the time Dungy arrived in 2002, he wanted defensive players who could wreak havoc on opponents and the speedy Freeney fit the bill perfectly.\n\nDungy concurred. So when draft analysts immediately branded the selection as the dreaded reach, the Colts shrugged it off.\n\nFreeney did not.\n\n\"I always had to bring my A-plus game,\" he said at his retirement ceremony. \"The Jonathan Ogdens, the Drew Breeses, the Tom Bradys, those guys made me bring my A-plus game every time. It raised my competitive nature to places I never knew existed.\"\n\nThe Colts found out how special Freeney would be quickly.\n\nDungy moved the former Syracuse star into the starting lineup midway through his rookie season, thanks to his routine penchant for embarrassing offensive linemen, harassing quarterbacks, forcing turnovers and wrecking games.\n\nBy the end of that season, Freeney had 46 tackles and nine forced fumbles, both of which became career bests, and 13 sacks -- one more than eventual AP Defensive Rookie of the Year Julius Peppers, whom Carolina took with the No. 2 overall draft pick that April. Peppers also will be inducted Saturday though Freeney is scheduled to speak first.\n\nOver those next 10 seasons, Freeney changed the game and Indy's image with the help of a virtual carbon copy pass rusher, Robert Mathis, who arrived in 2003.\n\nThat tag-team tandem quickly emerged as one of the NFL's most feared pass-rushing duos, making Freeney even more dangerous. Freeney won the league's sacks title in 2004 with 16. Two years later, Freeney and Mathis were the key components on Indy's Super Bowl-winning defense.\n\nThey didn't just challenge one another, they outmaneuvered opponents by learning one another's strengths and showing younger defensive teammates how to compete.\n\n\"He always wanted to race,\" former Colts linebacker and current assistant coach Cato June said, referring to Freeney. \"He was super fast and wanted to be the best athlete on the field. So you have these battles and you have this young Robert Mathis, who's just as fast. Those are the first interactions you have and then when you see a guy just day in and day out become an un-blockable beast, it's like wow!\"\n\nFreeney's impact on the sport was boundless.\n\nThe move he developed almost as a lark in high school was suddenly mimicked everywhere -- to the chagrin of traditional coaches who long complained it was not a proper technique.\n\nIn Indianapolis, all Freeney's teammates and coaches cared about was that it worked -- even if Freeney wasn't playing the sport exactly by the book.\n\n\"I used to get called for traveling all day (in basketball), so I couldn't really do the basketball thing,\" he said. \"So I got on the football field and the coach said 'Dwight, I don't care how you get there, just get there.' So I started using the spin move and kept going with it and it became a natural thing.\"\n\nIt changed Freeney's image forever.\n\nHe finished his 11-year career in Indianapolis with a franchise-record 107 1/2 sacks, a number only Mathis has surpassed, and embraced the simple celebration of a salute.\n\nAfter the 2012 season, Freeney left the Colts and headed to San Diego for two seasons. He spent his final three NFL seasons bouncing from Arizona to Atlanta to Seattle and finally Detroit before retiring where it all began, Indianapolis, in April 2018.\n\nThe final tally: 350 tackles, 125 1/2 sacks, 47 forced fumbles, seven double-digit sack seasons, seven Pro Bowl appearances, three All-Pro selections and one Super Bowl ring.\n\nYet for Freeney and his teammates, it was never about the numbers or awards. All they ever wanted to do was to prove to the doubters the Colts could win their way.\n\n\"Dwight deserves everything he's getting,\" former receiver and current Colts assistant Reggie Wayne said of the first defensive teammate he's seen enter the Hall of Fame. \"We knew if we scored enough points, Dwight was going to be able to cut it loose. We knew on third down Dwight was going to make a play for us. We knew those guys were going to go after the quarterback to get the ball back, especially Dwight with the spin.\"", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"},

So I started using the spin move and kept going with it and it became a natural thing.\"\n\nIt changed Freeney's image forever.\n\nHe finished his 11-year career in Indianapolis with a franchise-record 107 1/2 sacks, a number only Mathis has surpassed, and embraced the simple celebration of a salute.\n\nAfter the 2012 season, Freeney left the Colts and headed to San Diego for two seasons. He spent his final three NFL seasons bouncing from Arizona to Atlanta to Seattle and finally Detroit before retiring where it all began, Indianapolis, in April 2018.\n\nThe final tally: 350 tackles, 125 1/2 sacks, 47 forced fumbles, seven double-digit sack seasons, seven Pro Bowl appearances, three All-Pro selections and one Super Bowl ring.\n\nYet for Freeney and his teammates, it was never about the numbers or awards. All they ever wanted to do was to prove to the doubters the Colts could win their way.\n\n\"Dwight deserves everything he's getting,\" former receiver and current Colts assistant Reggie Wayne said of the first defensive teammate he's seen enter the Hall of Fame. \"We knew if we scored enough points, Dwight was going to be able to cut it loose. We knew on third down Dwight was going to make a play for us. We knew those guys were going to go after the quarterback to get the ball back, especially Dwight with the spin.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 * I understand and agree that registration on

Yahoo Sports will take a relatively short look at each legend and how he reached football immortality.\n\nPatrick Willis | Randy Gradishar | Steve McMichael | Andre Johnson\n\nIn a sport where physicality and brute force are celebrated, Dwight Freeney used speed and finesse at defensive end to disrupt offenses for over a decade.\n\nFreeney was announced as a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's Class of 2024 in his second year of eligibility. His dominance in both his collegiate career at Syracuse and his professional career, most notably with the Indianapolis Colts, will be recognized forever in Canton.\n\n\"You try to prepare for it -- the emotions and what you're gonna feel -- and you think if you had a pretty good career you have a good opportunity and chance to get there,\" Freeney said. \"... When you actually get that knock, you're really flushed with emotion, and you feel a gratitude and appreciation for all those who have been able to get there.\"\n\nDuring his NFL career, Freeney was a seven-time Pro-Bowler and named first-team All-Pro three times. He was also a key member of the 2006 Colts team that won Super Bowl XLI against the Chicago Bears. The defensive end was so dominant that he was named to the NFL's All-Decade Team of the 2000s alongside other defensive greats such as Michael Strahan, Ray Lewis, and fellow 2024 enshrinee Julius Pepper.\n\nAnd it was Freeney's patented spin move when rushing the quarterback that helped him not only overwhelm the competition, but also become a trailblazer for the more modern pass rushers who weren't always the biggest and strongest.\n\n\"Everyone always said I was undersized. Too small to play the position. He can't see past the offensive tackle, he won't be able to see the quarterback. But being a couple inches shorter, it gives you a natural leverage,\" Freeney said of his play style. \"I was really one of the first guys predicated on speed, quickness and getting to the ball.\"\n\nIt was during Freeney's high school years when he developed the spin move. He credits the And1 Mixtapes of the 1990s and 2000s for helping him create his technique.\n\n\"What I wanted to do was bring a little bit of [And1] into the game of football and I wanted to see how I can make this offensive tackle look absolutely silly, ridiculous. I wanted him to fall, break his ankles, etc., just like how they do on the basketball court,\" Freeney said on the \"RG3 and The Ones\" podcast.\n\nWhen working on basketball-like moves on the football field, Freeney stumbled upon the spin move. Once he tried it in a game, it made the offensive tackle fall down and that's when he \"found something there.\"\n\nFreeney's exploits in high school eventually landed him a football scholarship at Syracuse, where he was named an All-American and Big East Defensive Player of the Year, with a school-record 17.5 sacks his senior season that also led the country.\n\nHis elite-level athleticism as well as his speed caught the attention of the Colts. Despite questions about Freeney's size for the position at only 6-foot-1, he was selected with the 11th overall pick in the 2002 NFL Draft.\n\nFreeney made an immediate impact as a rookie. He recorded a Colts rookie record 13 sacks and led the NFL with nine forced fumbles and 20 tackles for a loss.\n\nIn his second year, Freeney took his game to new heights, earning his first Pro Bowl appearance and recording a three-sack game against the Miami Dolphins.\n\n\"It felt like no one could block me,\" Freeney said of the performance.\n\nFreeney was named first-team All-Pro the following two seasons, and finished with 51 sacks his first four years as a pro. Only five players in NFL history recorded more in the same time span.\n\nThat wasn't the only history that Freeney made. His 47 forced fumbles are fifth in NFL history. In the same vein, his nine forced fumbles in his rookie campaign was an NFL record at the time.\n\nOver 22 postseason games, he totaled 11 sacks (tied for sixth all-time) and six tackles for loss. Even after helping lead the Colts to their Super Bowl XLI win, Freeney continued to be a force, earning Pro-Bowl nods from 2008 to 2011 and recording double-digit sacks in three of those seasons. He had two sacks in Super Bowl XLIV, a loss to the New Orleans Saints, despite suffering an ankle injury in the AFC championship game.\n\nAfter his final year with the Colts in 2012, Freeney spent time with the then-San Diego Chargers, Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons (with whom he appeared in another Super Bowl), Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions. He totaled 18 sacks, three forced fumbles, 36 quarterback hits and 15 tackles for a loss between the ages of 33 and 37.\n\nFreeney retired in 2018 and was inducted into the Colts' Ring of Honor in 2019.\n\n\"Dwight built himself into one of the game's most feared pass rushers with his trademark spin moves,\" Colts team owner and CEO Jim Irsay said. \"He provided Colts fans with many thrilling moments as one of pro football's all-time greats, and he truly deserves this honor.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dhani_joseph@aol.com",

He took full advantage of his speed, his innovative moves and used the motivation of proving those doubters wrong all the way to a 16-year Hall of Fame career. He will be presented by Colts owner Jim Irsay, who is expected to be in a wheelchair after being injured in a fall.\n\n\"We all believed Dwight had the ability to be a force in the league,\" Polian told The Associated Press. \"The spin move was one Dwight executed perfectly and really perfected, so it was fine with us. But his base move was the bull rush, and he was so strong and fast he could run by most slow offensive tackles and guys who weren't as strong.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

By the time Dungy arrived in 2002, he wanted defensive players who could wreak havoc on opponents and the speedy Freeney fit the bill perfectly.\n\nDungy concurred. So when draft analysts immediately branded the selection as the dreaded reach, the Colts shrugged it off.\n\nFreeney did not.\n\n\"I always had to bring my A-plus game,\" he said at his retirement ceremony. \"The Jonathan Ogdens, the Drew Breeses, the Tom Bradys, those guys made me bring my A-plus game every time. It raised my competitive nature to places I never knew existed.\"\n\nThe Colts found out how special Freeney would be quickly.\n\nDungy moved the former Syracuse star into the starting lineup midway through his rookie season, thanks to his routine penchant for embarrassing offensive linemen, harassing quarterbacks, forcing turnovers and wrecking games.\n\nBy the end of that season, Freeney had 46 tackles and nine forced fumbles, both of which became career bests, and 13 sacks -- one more than eventual AP Defensive Rookie of the Year Julius Peppers, whom Carolina took with the No. 2 overall draft pick that April. Peppers also will be inducted Saturday though Freeney is scheduled to speak first.\n\nOver those next 10 seasons, Freeney changed the game and Indy's image with the help of a virtual carbon copy pass rusher, Robert Mathis, who arrived in 2003.\n\nThat tag-team tandem quickly emerged as one of the NFL's most feared pass-rushing duos, making Freeney even more dangerous. Freeney won the league's sacks title in 2004 with 16. Two years later, Freeney and Mathis were the key components on Indy's Super Bowl-winning defense.\n\nThey didn't just challenge one another, they outmaneuvered opponents by learning one another's strengths and showing younger defensive teammates how to compete.\n\n\"He always wanted to race,\" former Colts linebacker and current assistant coach Cato June said, referring to Freeney. \"He was super fast and wanted to be the best athlete on the field.

He took full advantage of his speed, his innovative moves and used the motivation of proving those doubters wrong all the way to a 16-year Hall of Fame career. He will be presented by Colts owner Jim Irsay, who is expected to be in a wheelchair after being injured in a fall.\n\n\"We all believed Dwight had the ability to be a force in the league,\" Polian told The Associated Press. \"The spin move was one Dwight executed perfectly and really perfected, so it was fine with us. But his base move was the bull rush, and he was so strong and fast he could run by most slow offensive tackles and guys who weren't as strong.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

By the time Dungy arrived in 2002, he wanted defensive players who could wreak havoc on opponents and the speedy Freeney fit the bill perfectly.\n\nDungy concurred. So when draft analysts immediately branded the selection as the dreaded reach, the Colts shrugged it off.\n\nFreeney did not.\n\n\"I always had to bring my A-plus game,\" he said at his retirement ceremony. \"The Jonathan Ogdens, the Drew Breeses, the Tom Bradys, those guys made me bring my A-plus game every time. It raised my competitive nature to places I never knew existed.\"\n\nThe Colts found out how special Freeney would be quickly.\n\nDungy moved the former Syracuse star into the starting lineup midway through his rookie season, thanks to his routine penchant for embarrassing offensive linemen, harassing quarterbacks, forcing turnovers and wrecking games.\n\nBy the end of that season, Freeney had 46 tackles and nine forced fumbles, both of which became career bests, and 13 sacks -- one more than eventual AP Defensive Rookie of the Year Julius Peppers, whom Carolina took with the No. 2 overall draft pick that April. Peppers also will be inducted Saturday though Freeney is scheduled to speak first.\n\nOver those next 10 seasons, Freeney changed the game and Indy's image with the help of a virtual carbon copy pass rusher, Robert Mathis, who arrived in 2003.\n\nThat tag-team tandem quickly emerged as one of the NFL's most feared pass-rushing duos, making Freeney even more dangerous. Freeney won the league's sacks title in 2004 with 16. Two years later, Freeney and Mathis were the key components on Indy's Super Bowl-winning defense.\n\nThey didn't just challenge one another, they outmaneuvered opponents by learning one another's strengths and showing younger defensive teammates how to compete.\n\n\"He always wanted to race,\" former Colts linebacker and current assistant coach Cato June said, referring to Freeney. \"He was super fast and wanted to be the best athlete on the field. So you have these battles and you have this young Robert Mathis, who's just as fast. Those are the first interactions you have and then when you see a guy just day in and day out become an un-blockable beast, it's like wow!\"\n\nFreeney's impact on the sport was boundless.\n\nThe move he developed almost as a lark in high school was suddenly mimicked everywhere -- to the chagrin of traditional coaches who long complained it was not a proper technique.\n\nIn Indianapolis, all Freeney's teammates and coaches cared about was that it worked -- even if Freeney wasn't playing the sport exactly by the book.\n\n\"I used to get called for traveling all day (in basketball), so I couldn't really do the basketball thing,\" he said. \"So I got on the football field and the coach said 'Dwight, I don't care how you get there, just get there.'

Too small to play the position. ... But being a couple inches shorter, it gives you a natural leverage.\"\n\nSeven men will be formally enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Aug. 3 in Canton, Ohio. Yahoo Sports will take a relatively short look at each legend and how he reached football immortality.\n\nPatrick Willis | Randy Gradishar | Steve McMichael | Andre Johnson\n\nIn a sport where physicality and brute force are celebrated, Dwight Freeney used speed and finesse at defensive end to disrupt opposing offenses for over a decade.\n\nFreeney was announced as a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's Class of 2024 in just his second year of eligibility. His dominance in both his collegiate career at Syracuse and his professional career, most notably with the Indianapolis Colts, will be recognized forever in Canton.\n\n\"You try to prepare for it -- the emotions and what you're gonna feel -- and you think if you had a pretty good career you have a good opportunity and chance to get there,\" Freeney said. \"... When you actually get that knock, you're really flushed with emotion, and you feel a gratitude and appreciation for all those who have been able to get there.\"\n\nDuring his NFL career, Freeney was a seven-time Pro-Bowler and named first-team All-Pro three times. He was also a key member of the 2006 Colts team that won Super Bowl XLI against the Chicago Bears. The defensive end was so dominant that he was named to the NFL's All-Decade Team of the 2000s alongside other defensive greats such as Michael Strahan, Ray Lewis, fellow 2024 enshrinee Julius Pepper and more.\n\nAnd it was Freeney's patented spin move when rushing the quarterback that helped him not only overwhelm the competition, but also become a trailblazer for the more modern pass rushers who weren't always the biggest and strongest.\n\n\"Everyone always said I was undersized. Too small to play the position. He can't see past the offensive tackle, he won't be able to see the quarterback. But being a couple inches shorter, it gives you a natural leverage,\" Freeney said of his play style. \"I was really one of the first guys predicated on speed, quickness and getting to the ball.\"\n\nIt was during Freeney's high school years where he developed the spin move. He credits the And1 Mixtapes of the 1990s and 2000s for helping him create his patented technique.\n\n\"What I wanted to do was bring a little bit of [And1] into the game of football and I wanted to see how I can make this offensive tackle look absolutely silly, ridiculous. I wanted him to fall, break his ankles, etc, just like how they do on the basketball court,\" Freeney said on the \"RG3 and The Ones\" podcast.\n\nWhen working on basketball-like moves on the football field, Freeney stumbled upon the spin move. Once he tried it in a game, it made the offensive tackle fall down and that's when he \"knew\" he \"found something there.\"\n\nFreeney's exploits in high school eventually landed him a football scholarship at Syracuse, where he was named an All-American and Big East Defensive Player of the Year, with a school-record 17.5 sacks his senior season that also led the country.\n\nHis elite-level athleticism as well as his speed caught the attention of the Colts. Despite questions about Freeney's size for the position at only 6-foot-1, he was selected with the 11th overall pick in the 2002 NFL Draft.\n\nFreeney made an immediate impact as a rookie. He recorded a Colts rookie record 13 sacks and led the NFL with nine forced fumbles and 20 tackles for a loss.\n\nIn his second year, Freeney took his game to new heights, earning his first Pro Bowl appearance and recording a three-sack game against the Miami Dolphins.\n\n\"It felt like no one could block me,\" Freeney said of the performance.\n\nFreeney was named first-team All-Pro the following two seasons, and finished with 51 sacks his first four years as a pro. Only five players in NFL history recorded more in the same time span.\n\nThat wasn't the only history that Freeney made. His 47 forced fumbles are fifth in NFL history. In the same vein, his nine forced fumbles in his rookie campaign was an NFL record at the time.\n\nOver 22 postseason games, he totaled 11 sacks (tied for sixth all-time) and six tackles for loss. Even after helping lead the Colts to their Super Bowl XLI win, Freeney continued to be a force, earning Pro-Bowl nods from 2008 to 2011 and recording double-digit sacks in three of those seasons. He had two sacks in Super Bowl XLIV, a loss to the New Orleans Saints, despite suffering an ankle injury in the AFC championship game.\n\nAfter his final year with the Colts in 2012, Freeney spent time with the then-San Diego Chargers, Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons (with whom he appeared in another Super Bowl), Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions. He totaled 18 sacks, three forced fumbles, 36 quarterback hits and 15 tackles for a loss between the ages of 33 and 37.\n\nFreeney retired in 2018 and was inducted into the Colts Ring of Honor in 2019.\n\n\"Dwight built himself into one of the game's most feared pass rushers with his trademark spin moves,\" Colts team owner and CEO Jim Irsay said. \"He provided Colts fans with many thrilling moments as one of pro football's all-time greats, and he truly deserves this honor.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

He took full advantage of his speed, his innovative moves and used the motivation of proving those doubters wrong all the way to a 16-year Hall of Fame career. He will be presented by Colts owner Jim Irsay, who is expected to be in a wheelchair after being injured in a fall.\n\n\"We all believed Dwight had the ability to be a force in the league,\" Polian told The Associated Press. \"The spin move was one Dwight executed perfectly and really perfected, so it was fine with us. But his base move was the bull rush, and he was so strong and fast he could run by most slow offensive tackles and guys who weren't as strong.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

By the time Dungy arrived in 2002, he wanted defensive players who could wreak havoc on opponents and the speedy Freeney fit the bill perfectly.\n\nDungy concurred. So when draft analysts immediately branded the selection as the dreaded reach, the Colts shrugged it off.\n\nFreeney did not.\n\n\"I always had to bring my A-plus game,\" he said at his retirement ceremony. \"The Jonathan Ogdens, the Drew Breeses, the Tom Bradys, those guys made me bring my A-plus game every time. It raised my competitive nature to places I never knew existed.\"\n\nThe Colts found out how special Freeney would be quickly.\n\nDungy moved the former Syracuse star into the starting lineup midway through his rookie season, thanks to his routine penchant for embarrassing offensive linemen, harassing quarterbacks, forcing turnovers and wrecking games.\n\nBy the end of that season, Freeney had 46 tackles and nine forced fumbles, both of which became career bests, and 13 sacks -- one more than eventual AP Defensive Rookie of the Year Julius Peppers, whom Carolina took with the No. 2 overall draft pick that April. Peppers also will be inducted Saturday though Freeney is scheduled to speak first.\n\nOver those next 10 seasons, Freeney changed the game and Indy's image with the help of a virtual carbon copy pass rusher, Robert Mathis, who arrived in 2003.\n\nThat tag-team tandem quickly emerged as one of the NFL's most feared pass-rushing duos, making Freeney even more dangerous. Freeney won the league's sacks title in 2004 with 16. Two years later, Freeney and Mathis were the key components on Indy's Super Bowl-winning defense.\n\nThey didn't just challenge one another, they outmaneuvered opponents by learning one another's strengths and showing younger defensive teammates how to compete.\n\n\"He always wanted to race,\" former Colts linebacker and current assistant coach Cato June said, referring to Freeney. \"He was super fast and wanted to be the best athlete on the field. So you have these battles and you have this young Robert Mathis, who's just as fast. Those are the first interactions you have and then when you see a guy just day in and day out become an un-blockable beast, it's like wow!\"\n\nFreeney's impact on the sport was boundless.\n\nThe move he developed almost as a lark in high school was suddenly mimicked everywhere -- to the chagrin of traditional coaches who long complained it was not a proper technique.\n\nIn Indianapolis, all Freeney's teammates and coaches cared about was that it worked -- even if Freeney wasn't playing the sport exactly by the book.\n\n\"I used to get called for traveling all day (in basketball), so I couldn't really do the basketball thing,\" he said. \"So I got on the football field and the coach said 'Dwight, I don't care how you get there, just get there.' So I started using the spin move and kept going with it and it became a natural thing.\"\n\nIt changed Freeney's image forever.\n\nHe finished his 11-year career in Indianapolis with a franchise-record 107 1/2 sacks, a number only Mathis has surpassed, and embraced the simple celebration of a salute.\n\nAfter the 2012 season, Freeney left the Colts and headed to San Diego for two seasons. He spent his final three NFL seasons bouncing from Arizona to Atlanta to Seattle and finally Detroit before retiring where it all began, Indianapolis, in April 2018.\n\nThe final tally: 350 tackles, 125 1/2 sacks, 47 forced fumbles, seven double-digit sack seasons, seven Pro Bowl appearances, three All-Pro selections and one Super Bowl ring.\n\nYet for Freeney and his teammates, it was never about the numbers or awards. All they ever wanted to do was to prove to the doubters the Colts could win their way.\n\n\"Dwight deserves everything he's getting,\" former receiver and current Colts assistant Reggie Wayne said of the first defensive teammate he's seen enter the Hall of Fame. \"We knew if we scored enough points, Dwight was going to be able to cut it loose. We knew on third down Dwight was going to make a play for us. We knew those guys were going to go after the quarterback to get the ball back, especially Dwight with the spin.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I

So I started using the spin move and kept going with it and it became a natural thing.\"\n\nHe finished his 11-year career in Indianapolis with a franchise-record 107 1/2 sacks, a number only Mathis has surpassed, and embraced the simple celebration of a salute.\n\nAfter the 2012 season, Freeney left the Colts and headed to San Diego for two seasons.

He took full advantage of his speed, his innovative moves and used the motivation of proving those doubters wrong all the way to a 16-year Hall of Fame career. He will be presented by Colts owner Jim Irsay, who is expected to be in a wheelchair after being injured in a fall.\n\n\"We all believed Dwight had the ability to be a force in the league,\" Polian told The Associated Press. \"The spin move was one Dwight executed perfectly and really perfected, so it was fine with us. But his base move was the bull rush, and he was so strong and fast he could run by most slow offensive tackles and guys who weren't as strong.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

By the time Dungy arrived in 2002, he wanted defensive players who could wreak havoc on opponents and the speedy Freeney fit the bill perfectly.\n\nDungy concurred. So when draft analysts immediately branded the selection as the dreaded reach, the Colts shrugged it off.\n\nFreeney did not.\n\n\"I always had to bring my A-plus game,\" he said at his retirement ceremony. \"The Jonathan Ogdens, the Drew Breeses, the Tom Bradys, those guys made me bring my A-plus game every time. It raised my competitive nature to places I never knew existed.\"\n\nThe Colts found out how special Freeney would be quickly.\n\nDungy moved the former Syracuse star into the starting lineup midway through his rookie season, thanks to his routine penchant for embarrassing offensive linemen, harassing quarterbacks, forcing turnovers and wrecking games.\n\nBy the end of that season, Freeney had 46 tackles and nine forced fumbles, both of which became career bests, and 13 sacks -- one more than eventual AP Defensive Rookie of the Year Julius Peppers, whom Carolina took with the No. 2 overall draft pick that April. Peppers also will be inducted Saturday though Freeney is scheduled to speak first.\n\nOver those next 10 seasons, Freeney changed the game and Indy's image with the help of a virtual carbon copy pass rusher, Robert Mathis, who arrived in 2003.\n\nThat tag-team tandem quickly emerged as one of the NFL's most feared pass-rushing duos, making Freeney even more dangerous. Freeney won the league's sacks title in 2004 with 16. Two years later, Freeney and Mathis were the key components on Indy's Super Bowl-winning defense.\n\nThey didn't just challenge one another, they outmaneuvered opponents by learning one another's strengths and showing younger defensive teammates how to compete.\n\n\"He always wanted to race,\" former Colts linebacker and current assistant coach Cato June said, referring to Freeney. \"He was super fast and wanted to be the best athlete on the field. So you have these battles and you have this young Robert Mathis, who's just as fast. Those are the first interactions you have and then when you see a guy just day in and day out become an un-blockable beast, it's like wow!\"\n\nFreeney's impact on the sport was boundless.\n\nThe move he developed almost as a lark in high school was suddenly mimicked everywhere -- to the chagrin of traditional coaches who long complained it was not a proper technique.\n\nIn Indianapolis, all Freeney's teammates and coaches cared about was that it worked -- even if Freeney wasn't playing the sport exactly by the book.\n\n\"I used to get called for traveling all day (in basketball), so I couldn't really do the basketball thing,\" he said. \"So I got on the football field and the coach said 'Dwight, I don't care how you get there, just get there.' So I started using the spin move and kept going with it and it became a natural thing.\"\n\nIt changed Freeney's image forever.\n\nHe finished his 11-year career in Indianapolis with a franchise-record 107 1/2 sacks, a number only Mathis has surpassed, and embraced the simple celebration of a salute.\n\nAfter the 2012 season, Freeney left the Colts and headed to San Diego for two seasons. He spent his final three NFL seasons bouncing from Arizona to Atlanta to Seattle and finally Detroit before retiring where it all began, Indianapolis, in April 2018.\n\nThe final tally: 350 tackles, 125 1/2 sacks, 47 forced fumbles, seven double-digit sack seasons, seven Pro Bowl appearances, three All-Pro selections and one Super Bowl ring.\n\nYet for Freeney and his teammates, it was never about the numbers or awards. All they ever wanted to do was to prove to the doubters the Colts could win their way.\n\n\"Dwight deserves everything he's getting,\" former receiver and current Colts assistant Reggie Wayne said of the first defensive teammate he's seen enter the Hall of Fame. \"We knew if we scored enough points, Dwight was going to be able to cut it loose. We knew on third down Dwight was going to make a play for us. We knew those guys were going to go after the quarterback to get the ball back, especially Dwight with the spin.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local

His high-octane offense would build a lead; it was up to the defense to finish it off.\n\nFor a decade, Dwight Freeney was the Colts' closer.\n\n\"End this,\" Manning would tell him before the defense jogged onto the field. \"This is your time.\"\n\nFreeney relished it, the stakes and the spotlight, the game's outcome hinging on his ability to beat the man across from him. Games were mostly a grind, he says: As one of the league's premier pass rushers, Freeney typically spent the better part of three hours getting held, chipped, punched and double-teamed. But he learned to play chess with the offensive tackle, using dozens of snaps early to set himself up for a precious moment in the fourth quarter when he could pounce.\n\n\"In a one-score game, he was Michael Jordan with the ball in his hand and a few seconds left,\" says former Colts tight end and longtime teammate Dallas Clark. \"We'd all sit on the sideline, knowing exactly what was about to happen.\"\n\nFreeney knew, too.\n\n\"The best part is when you know the other guy is scared to death,\" he says. \"He's not getting any help. He knows exactly what move I'm gonna do, and he knows he can't stop it.\"\n\nThat's when Freeney went to work. Speed. Strength. The swim. The spin. The tackle was left guessing. Hoping. Praying. Inevitably, the quarterback was left on the ground, the down over, the win clinched, the fans in full throat.\n\nManning would simply grin from the sideline.\n\nColts owner Jim Irsay says, \"I used to love that our best offensive player would find our best defensive player and basically tell him, 'Free, do your thing, and let's get the hell out of here.'\"\n\nFreeney's objective never changed.\n\n\"My whole football career,\" he says, \"whoever was blocking me, I wanted to make that dude look absolutely silly.\"\n\nDwight Freeney's road to Canton, Ohio, where he'll be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame this week, started on the soccer field.\n\nMore specifically, on the bench next to the soccer field.\n\nHe'd given football a try for two days in fifth grade. His Pee Wee coaches stuck him at left guard. He hated it. He quit. He spent the better part of 10 years pouring himself into his other passions: soccer, basketball and baseball.\n\nProblem was, the Bloomfield (Conn.) High School varsity soccer team didn't have much of a defense -- Freeney says as a freshman goalie, he faced 30 or 40 shots a game. And one evening, after letting four or five slip past, he found himself benched for the first time in his life. He was despondent.\n\nThat's when Jack Cochran, the school's football coach, walked up.\n\n\"You'd make a great defensive end,\" he said.\n\nFreeney resisted. Football? No thanks. Defensive end? He didn't even know where to start.\n\nSo Cochran simplified it for him.\n\n\"I don't care you how you get from Point A to Point B,\" the coach told him. \"Just get there.\"\n\nSimple enough. Freeney scripted his Hall of Fame career getting to Point B.\n\nAfter four seasons at Syracuse, the biggest knock on him entering the 2002 NFL Draft was his size. He stood just 6 feet. Most defensive ends in that era were 6-foot-3 or taller.\n\n\"When I heard his height, I wasn't sure he was gonna fit the bill,\" Irsay admits.\n\nBut after the owner, whose team had the 11th pick, turned on the tape -- including Freeney's 4 1/2-sack game against the fastest quarterback college football had ever seen, Michael Vick -- he started to consider it. Freeney's sizzling 4.38 40-yard dash at Syracuse's pro day didn't hurt.\n\nHe was a defensive end with wide receiver speed.\n\nThe final decision was left to Tony Dungy, the Colts' new coach. Dungy and team president Bill Polian were side by side on treadmills the day before the draft, weighing their options mid-workout. Irsay told them he wanted defense, preferably a front-seven player. Polian threw out two names: Freeney and Charles Grant, a defensive tackle out of Georgia who stood 3 inches taller.\n\n\"Bill, given the choice, I'll take speed every time,\" Dungy told him.\n\nFreeney was the pick.\n\nAlmost instantly, he remade the Colts' defense, a unit that for years would still toil in the shadow of Manning's stacked offense. Freeney forced nine fumbles as a rookie and piled up 10 sacks over the second half of the season. He was an All-Pro by Year 2, and four years in, he'd racked up 51 sacks, third most in the league in that span. Opponents trying to keep up with the Colts' vaunted offense were often forced to throw it more than they wanted to. Freeney made them pay.\n\n\"Don't worry about stopping the run,\" legendary defensive line coach John Teerlinck would bark at Freeney and Robert Mathis, Freeney's running mate for a decade. \"Just get to the quarterback!\"\n\nTogether, they became one of the most feared pass-rushing duos in league history. (Today Freeney sits two spots ahead of his old teammate on the all-time sacks list, 125.5 to 123.)\n\n\"Truth is, if Rob wasn't on the Colts all those years, I'd have way more sacks,\" Freeney says with a laugh. \"And if I wasn't on the team, he'd have way more sacks. We stole so many from each other.\"\n\nFreeney would later credit Teerlinck, who died in 2020, for teaching him what a real pass rusher was. \"You have to eat, sleep and breathe getting after the quarterback,\" Freeney explains. \"It never leaves you.\" He'd see an old lady in the grocery store and start thinking about which move he was gonna pull on her. He'd wake up at 3 a.m. the night after a four-sack game, stressed about not getting five.\n\nClark saw it on those stifling summer mornings in Terre Haute, Ind., during training camp. He was the Colts' first-round pick the year after Freeney arrived, a raw tight end out of Iowa who'd stare at the ceiling some nights in his dorm room on the Indiana State campus, worried his blocking assignment the next day would include the lightning quick defensive end nobody could stay in front of.\n\n\"When my number was called against Freeney in one-on-ones, my mind said, 'Oh, s -- !'\" Clark remembers. \"Then I'm telling myself, 'OK, get light on your feet. Get back. Get hands on him quick, because if you don't, he's gone.\"\n\nClark wasn't alone.\n\n\"I'll be honest,\" says six-time Pro Bowler Jeff Saturday, \"Freeney's get-off terrified me.\"\n\n\"There were only a few guys I played with who put the fear of God in people,\" adds Tarik Glenn, a two-time Pro Bowl left tackle. \"Freeney was one of them.\"\n\nThe pair -- Glenn and Freeney -- warred in practice every day for five years. The pass rusher tested new moves. The left tackle tested new counters. The payoff arrived on Sundays.\n\nPretty soon, both were among the league's best at their positions.\n\n\"I never faced anybody in a game who was better than him,\" Glenn says.\n\nGlenn still remembers what the best offensive tackles of that era -- Hall of Famers like Jonathan Ogden, Willie Roaf and Orlando Pace -- would tell him after facing Freeney for 60-plus snaps.\n\nJason Peters lasted longer than any offensive lineman in NFL history but one. He made nine Pro Bowls and six All-Pro teams. Last fall, he was asked which pass rusher across his 20-year career gave him the most trouble.\n\n\"Dwight Freeney by far,\" Peters said. \"You know why? Because all his rushes look exactly the same. He set you up better than anyone. His speed rush looked just like the bull rush. The bull rush looked just like the spin. The spin started like the rest of them. Man, he was slippery. Hardest guy to stay in front of I've ever seen.\"\n\nFreeney's repertoire ran deep, and it required constant maintenance. \"Sharpening,\" he calls it. He'd stay after practice, set up four or five obstacles in succession -- tackling dummies or trash cans -- and exhaust himself, move after move after move. He'd duck under the first. He'd spin around the second. He'd swim past the third. He'd bull rush the fourth. He'd rep for an hour, then stagger off the field dead tired.\n\nThe aim: simulate the unpredictability that ensues after the snap. Freeney knew he had to be comfortable amid chaos.\n\n\"I'd put myself in situations where it was damn near impossible for me to pull off a move,\" he says. \"That made the games easier.\"\n\nHis signature move was the spin, and it was a thing of football beauty. Freeney would whip his 268-pound frame around in a flash. Some tackles would whiff completely, their feet frozen. Some would fall flat on their back.\n\nNothing embarrassed them more.\n\n\"He was born with that move,\" Glenn says. \"You think Allen Iverson had to work on the crossover? Or Tim Hardaway had to practice his first step? That came naturally to him.\"\n\nFreeney tells it differently. The spin started on the high school basketball court, where, as a power forward, his pivots in the post always led to a whistle. Traveling. \"Every damn time,\" he steams. But in those early football practices, after Cochran convinced him to switch sports, Freeney decided to borrow his post move and try it out on offensive tackles.\n\nThere's no traveling in football.\n\nFurther inspiration came from a VHS cassette he used to watch over and over: the And1 mixtape, a collage of playground hoops highlights that led to a nationwide tour in the early 2000s. The worse a player could embarrass a defender, the more the crowd would roar.\n\n\"They were breaking ankles, making guys look like fools,\" Freeney says. \"I loved it. I told myself, 'I'm gonna do that on the football field.' I wanted to take that type of creativity and make it part of my game.\"\n\nSo he did. Freeney became an artist out there, juking, spinning, ducking, slipping and speeding past linemen. Hordes of offensive tackles, fearing utter humiliation, would simply grab his jersey and refuse to let go. Freeney was held at a legendary clip, as much as any player of his era. \"That's how most of those guys survived,\" Freeney says now, chuckling. \"You hold on for dear life and hope the refs don't catch it. Because if they called every hold back when I played, the games would still be going.\"\n\nFreeney used to lumber over to the Colts' sideline and seek out the equipment staff, begging them to tighten his jersey.\n\n\"I don't want anything loose they can grab ahold of!\" he'd shout.\n\nThere was also a doggedness to Freeney's approach -- it's why he lasted 16 seasons, suiting up for five teams after he left the Colts in 2013. He was rigid when it came to his routine. For years, Freeney ate only steak and rice (with a pinch of salt) for every meal, including breakfast. Teammates would rib him; Freeney never wavered. He was among the early believers in weekly cryotherapy treatments, a practice that's since become routine around the NFL, and a devotee of the ARP device, which would send electric currents through his muscles to accelerate recovery.\n\n\"We made fun of him all the time,\" Clark says with a laugh. \"We thought he was an alien.\"\n\nBut it paid off. Freeney missed only 11 games in 11 years with the Colts. After he suffered a nasty high-ankle sprain in the fourth quarter of the team's 2009 AFC Championship Game win over the Jets, questions loomed for two weeks around his availability for Super Bowl XLIV. \"I'm telling you, 99.9 percent of guys with that injury wouldn't even have been in the conversation to play,\" Clark says. \"That ankle was wrecked.\n\n\"But because it was Freeney, we all believed he was gonna be there.\"\n\nHe was. And on a tender ankle, Freeney one-armed Saints QB Drew Brees to the turf like a rag doll in the second quarter, the Colts already up 10-0.\n\nBut the ankle couldn't endure 65 snaps. The Colts' pass rush vanished late, and Brees completed every pass but two after halftime. The Saints won 31-17.\n\nIrsay's never gotten over it. A win would've been the franchise's second Super Bowl victory in four seasons.\n\n\"No question we win that game if Freeney's fully healthy,\" the owner says almost 15 years later. \"No question.\n\n\"You can't underestimate what he meant to us. He was our guy on defense. He was one of my favorite players I've ever watched in our league. Watching him play was like watching a barroom brawl.\"\n\nFreeney retired in 2018, settled in Florida, became close friends with Michael Jordan and started working on his golf game. Whenever the Hall of Fame was brought up, he'd shrug it off.\n\nYears passed. The topic got harder and harder to ignore.\n\n\"I'd run into Hall of Famers, guys who were some of the best pass rushers ever, and they'd tell me, 'Bro, you're a first-ballot guy, no doubt,'\" Freeney says.\n\nHe started to believe them. He started to get his hopes up. And when the call didn't come his first year as a finalist, it stung.\n\n\"That hit really hard,\" Freeney admits.\n\nSo he retreated to the golf course, pushing it out of his mind. Then one morning, about a year later, Freeney walked in the front door of The Grove -- Jordan's exclusive club -- a few minutes before his tee time and saw Dungy standing there, wearing his own gold jacket.\n\nHe knew.\n\n\"Welcome to the family,\" his old coach told him. Freeney was a part of the Hall of Fame's Class of 2024.\n\nHe was almost speechless.\n\n\"I'm gonna be spraying that ball all over the place today,\" he joked.\n\n\"I'm just glad he got in,\" Jordan said later, \"because I had to console him last year.\"\n\nA career that first sprouted on the bench next to the soccer field in Bloomfield, Conn., will now live on in Canton, Ohio. Dwight Freeney made it to Point B so often -- and made so many offensive tackles look silly along the way -- that he became one of the best to ever do it.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com",

He took full advantage of his speed, his innovative moves and used the motivation of proving those doubters wrong all the way to a 16-year Hall of Fame career. He will be presented by Colts owner Jim Irsay, who is expected to be in a wheelchair after being injured in a fall.\n\n\"We all believed Dwight had the ability to be a force in the league,\" Polian told The Associated Press. \"The spin move was one Dwight executed perfectly and really perfected, so it was fine with us. But his base move was the bull rush, and he was so strong and fast he could run by most slow offensive tackles and guys who weren't as strong.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Napa officials, nonprofits seem cautious\n\nPolian, the Hall of Fame executive, simply followed the plan.\n\nAfter creating the blueprint that produced four straight AFC titles in Buffalo, Polian spent his early years in Indianapolis putting together an offense around Peyton Manning. By the time Dungy arrived in 2002, he wanted defensive players who could wreak havoc on opponents and the speedy Freeney fit the bill perfectly.\n\nDungy concurred. So when draft analysts immediately branded the selection as the dreaded reach, the Colts shrugged it off.\n\nFreeney did not.\n\n\"I always had to bring my A-plus game,\" he said at his retirement ceremony. \"The Jonathan Ogdens, the Drew Breeses, the Tom Bradys, those guys made me bring my A-plus game every time. It raised my competitive nature to places I never knew existed.\"\n\nThe Colts found out how special Freeney would be quickly.\n\nDungy moved the former Syracuse star into the starting lineup midway through his rookie season, thanks to his routine penchant for embarrassing offensive linemen, harassing quarterbacks, forcing turnovers and wrecking games.\n\nBy the end of that season, Freeney had 46 tackles and nine forced fumbles, both of which became career bests, and 13 sacks -- one more than eventual AP Defensive Rookie of the Year Julius Peppers, whom Carolina took with the No. 2 overall draft pick that April. Peppers also will be inducted Saturday though Freeney is scheduled to speak first.\n\nOver those next 10 seasons, Freeney changed the game and Indy's image with the help of a virtual carbon copy pass rusher, Robert Mathis, who arrived in 2003.\n\nThat tag-team tandem quickly emerged as one of the NFL's most feared pass-rushing duos, making Freeney even more dangerous. Freeney won the league's sacks title in 2004 with 16. Two years later, Freeney and Mathis were the key components on Indy's Super Bowl-winning defense.\n\nThey didn't just challenge one another, they outmaneuvered opponents by learning one another's strengths and showing younger defensive teammates how to compete.\n\n\"He always wanted to race,\" former Colts linebacker and current assistant coach Cato June said, referring to Freeney. \"He was super fast and wanted to be the best athlete on the field. So you have these battles and you have this young Robert Mathis, who's just as fast. Those are the first interactions you have and then when you see a guy just day in and day out become an un-blockable beast, it's like wow!\"\n\nFreeney's impact on the sport was boundless.\n\nThe move he developed almost as a lark in high school was suddenly mimicked everywhere -- to the chagrin of traditional coaches who long complained it was not a proper technique.\n\nIn Indianapolis, all Freeney's teammates and coaches cared about was that it worked -- even if Freeney wasn't playing the sport exactly by the book.\n\n\"I used to get called for traveling all day (in basketball), so I couldn't really do the basketball thing,\" he said. \"So I got on the football field and the coach said 'Dwight, I don't care how you get there, just get there.' So I started using the spin move and kept going with it and it became a natural thing.\"\n\nIt changed Freeney's image forever.\n\nHe finished his 11-year career in Indianapolis with a franchise-record 107 1/2 sacks, a number only Mathis has surpassed, and embraced the simple celebration of a salute.\n\nAfter the 2012 season, Freeney left the Colts and headed to San Diego for two seasons. He spent his final three NFL seasons bouncing from Arizona to Atlanta to Seattle and finally Detroit before retiring where it all began, Indianapolis, in April 2018.\n\nThe final tally: 350 tackles, 125 1/2 sacks, 47 forced fumbles, seven double-digit sack seasons, seven Pro Bowl appearances, three All-Pro selections and one Super Bowl ring.\n\nYet for Freeney and his teammates, it was never about the numbers or awards. All they ever wanted to do was to prove to the doubters the Colts could win their way.\n\n\"Dwight deserves everything he's getting,\" former receiver and current Colts assistant Reggie Wayne said of the first defensive teammate he's seen enter the Hall of Fame. \"We knew if we scored enough points, Dwight was going to be able to cut it loose. We knew on third down Dwight was going to make a play for us. We knew those guys were going to go after the quarterback to get the ball back, especially Dwight with the spin.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I

Defensive end Dwight Freeney was a rookie in 2002 and spent 11 of his 16 NFL seasons with the Colts.\n\nDwight Freeney's arrival in Canton takes Browns fans back to the early days of the Browns' expansion era.\n\nFreeney was a Colts rookie when he battled veteran Browns left tackle Ross Verba late in the 2002 season at Cleveland.\n\nThe Browns were on a 5-2 hot streak that still stands out as a highlight of the era. Beating the Colts would have been a crowning achievement, a conquest of a rising power led by quarterback Peyton Manning.\n\nAt first, Colts head coach Tony Dungy intended to break in Freeney slowly, but the rookie kept making plays, soon earning a heavy workload.\n\nIn the Browns game, Freeney sacked Tim Couch twice for losses totalling 17 yards. He squashed a drive by tackling William Green for a 5-yard loss.\n\nIt was a thriller. Cleveland play caller Bruce Arians dialed up a touchdown drive that provided a 23-21 fourth-quarter lead, but Manning made hay with Marvin Harrison (172 receiving yards) and rallied the Colts to a 28-23 advantage.\n\nCouch got the Browns to the 5 in the final seconds before running out of downs.\n\nFreeney's play against Cleveland continued to reflect why he is going in the Hall of Fame.\n\nThe teams met again in the 2003 season opener, when Browns quarterback Kelly Holcomb was coming off a 429-yard day in a 36-33 playoff loss at Pittsburgh.\n\nFreeney helped put Holcomb on the run all day. In the fourth quarter, he tackled Green for a loss that stalled a promising drive. He was a factor in another late stop. Mike Vanderjagt's 45-yard field goal with six seconds left gave Indianapolis a 9-6 win.\n\nIn 2005, facing Browns left tackle L.J. Shelton, Freeney sacked Trent Dilfer three times in a 13-6 Colts victory.\n\nIn 2008, when he faced second-year Browns left tackle Joe Thomas, the Browns led 6-3 in the fourth quarter. They had a third-and-8 near midfield when Freeney beat Thomas, dislodged the ball while sacking Derek Anderson, and watched teammate Robert Mathis return the resulting fumble recovery for a game-winning touchdown.\n\n\"He got the best of me a couple of times, especially early in my career,\" Thomas said when both he and Freeney had retired.\n\nThomas, four years younger than Freeney, recalls being in college, studying Hall of Fame left tackle Jonathan Ogden.\n\n\"Dwight Freeney had two sacks against Ogden ... against a first-ballot Hall of Famer!\" Thomas said. \"He gave one of the best left tackles all-time his lunch that day.\"\n\nThomas said the 6-foot-1, 265-pound Freeney \"weopanized the spin move\" and noted, \"people had done it before, but not like him.\"\n\n\"He could do the three things that make you a great pass rusher,\" Thomas said. \"He could beat you inside, he could beat you outside, and he could beat you running you over. He was short and squatty, with those big strong thighs.\"\n\nDuring a stop in Canton this year, Freeney recalled facing Thomas.\n\n\"I spent a lot of time studying Joe, trying to find a weakness in his approach,\" he said. \"I couldn't find any.\n\n\"I would keep turning on film, turning on film, trying to find somebody who got to him.\n\n\"There wasn't anybody. I would come to the conclusion, I'm going to have get creative.\"\n\nFreeney was on the same defensive line as another elite defensive end, Mathis, who recently told colts.com writer JJ Stankevitz, \"I would put Dwight up against anybody one-on-one at any point in history.\"\n\nFreeney's calling card after getting up from a big play was a pound of the chest and a salute.\n\nColts owner Jim Irsay, selected by Freeney to be his Hall of Fame presenter, said such a player comes along \"every 70 years ... turn on the film and, mayhem.\"\n\nFreeney, now 44, grew up in Bloomfield, Connecticut, north of New York City. His favorite player was Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor, who ranked high on a 2019 USA Today list of the 100 best players all-time.\n\nThe day Freeney announced his retirement, he said, \"I gave it my all, and hopefully I made a difference in some kid's life like Lawrence Taylor did for me.\"\n\nIn college, Freeney played for Syracuse teams that were competitive in the Big East, except in three losses to the Miami Hurricanes by a combined 130-13 score.\n\nHe joined the Colts with limited fanfare as a No. 11 overall draft pick in 2002.\n\n\"He was in the perfect situation,\" said Dungy, who was Freeney's head coach from 2002-08. \"We played on AstroTurf. We had the lead a lot, and people were going to have to throw against us.\"\n\nDungy and General Manager Bill Polian conceded the 6-foot-1 Freeney was quite short for an NFL defensive end, but both were taken by his speed, skill and zeal. They were getting a brute who could bench press 500 pounds and squat 750.\n\nThe list of players taken in the rest of the first round was fairly nondescript, although Baltimore landed future Hall of Fame safety Ed Reed at No. 24. The Browns took the aforementioned William Green at No. 16.\n\nFreeney made second-team All-Pro in his second season, 2003, when Michael Strahan and Leonard Little were the first-team defensive ends. Freeney and Julius Peppers, both members of the Hall of Fame Class of 2024, were the first-teamers in 2004.\n\nFreeney and Osi Umenyiora were the first-teamers in 2005. Jason Taylor, Jared Allen, Patrick Kerney, Mario Williams and Justin Tuck were other contemporaries in that time frame.\n\nCourtney Brown, the first pick of the 2000 draft by Cleveland, never joined the discussion of \"best ends\" - his last NFL season was 2005.\n\nFreeney spent 11 seasons with the Colts. Unlike Thomas, who retired after 11 years with the Browns, Freeney hung on another five years, suiting up for the Chargers, Cardinals, Falcons, Lions and Seahawks.\n\nIn 2011, near the end of Freeney's Indianapolis days, the Browns finally beat the Colts, but with Kerry Collins and not Manning playing quarterback. Freeney had a 9-yard strip sack of Colt McCoy.\n\nFreeney was 35 when he sacked Josh McCown in a 35-20 Cardinals win at Cleveland in 2015.\n\nThe last game of his career was with the Falcons in Super Bowl 51, on Feb. 5, 2017 in Houston.\n\nAtlanta wound up blowing a lead, but one play after Falcons QB Matt Ryan fumbled the ball away to the Patriots in the fourth quarter, Freeney sacked Tom Brady.\n\nIn the 2019 ranking of history's greatest players, the top four were Jerry Rice, Brady, Taylor and Jim Brown. Brown was a Syracuse man. Freeney, another one, joins him in the Hall of Fame.", "source": {"uri": "cantonrep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Canton Repository"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canton_repository@cantonrep.com",

The Colts' high-powered Peyton Manning-led offense took care of the rest.\n\nFreeney played in Indianapolis from 2002-2012. He would play for a few more teams toward the end of his career, but Freeney will always be remembered as a Colts legend.\n\nHe was selected to seven Pro Bowls during his career. Freeney led the league in sacks with 16 during the 2004 season. The Colts also won a Super Bowl while Freeney was on the roster.\n\nFreeney may have received inspiration from his relationship with Jordan.

He took full advantage of his speed, his innovative moves and used the motivation of proving those doubters wrong all the way to a 16-year Hall of Fame career. He will be presented by Colts owner Jim Irsay, who is expected to be in a wheelchair after being injured in a fall.\n\n\"We all believed Dwight had the ability to be a force in the league,\" Polian told The Associated Press. \"The spin move was one Dwight executed perfectly and really perfected, so it was fine with us. But his base move was the bull rush, and he was so strong and fast he could run by most slow offensive tackles and guys who weren't as strong.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

By the time Dungy arrived in 2002, he wanted defensive players who could wreak havoc on opponents and the speedy Freeney fit the bill perfectly.\n\nDungy concurred. So when draft analysts immediately branded the selection as the dreaded reach, the Colts shrugged it off.\n\nFreeney did not.\n\n\"I always had to bring my A-plus game,\" he said at his retirement ceremony. \"The Jonathan Ogdens, the Drew Breeses, the Tom Bradys, those guys made me bring my A-plus game every time. It raised my competitive nature to places I never knew existed.\"\n\nThe Colts found out how special Freeney would be quickly.\n\nDungy moved the former Syracuse star into the starting lineup midway through his rookie season, thanks to his routine penchant for embarrassing offensive linemen, harassing quarterbacks, forcing turnovers and wrecking games.\n\nBy the end of that season, Freeney had 46 tackles and nine forced fumbles, both of which became career bests, and 13 sacks -- one more than eventual AP Defensive Rookie of the Year Julius Peppers, whom Carolina took with the No. 2 overall draft pick that April. Peppers also will be inducted Saturday though Freeney is scheduled to speak first.\n\nOver those next 10 seasons, Freeney changed the game and Indy's image with the help of a virtual carbon copy pass rusher, Robert Mathis, who arrived in 2003.\n\nThat tag-team tandem quickly emerged as one of the NFL's most feared pass-rushing duos, making Freeney even more dangerous. Freeney won the league's sacks title in 2004 with 16. Two years later, Freeney and Mathis were the key components on Indy's Super Bowl-winning defense.\n\nThey didn't just challenge one another, they outmaneuvered opponents by learning one another's strengths and showing younger defensive teammates how to compete.\n\n\"He always wanted to race,\" former Colts linebacker and current assistant coach Cato June said, referring to Freeney. \"He was super fast and wanted to be the best athlete on the field. So you have these battles and you have this young Robert Mathis, who's just as fast. Those are the first interactions you have and then when you see a guy just day in and day out become an un-blockable beast, it's like wow!\"\n\nFreeney's impact on the sport was boundless.\n\nThe move he developed almost as a lark in high school was suddenly mimicked everywhere -- to the chagrin of traditional coaches who long complained it was not a proper technique.\n\nIn Indianapolis, all Freeney's teammates and coaches cared about was that it worked -- even if Freeney wasn't playing the sport exactly by the book.\n\n\"I used to get called for traveling all day (in basketball), so I couldn't really do the basketball thing,\" he said. \"So I got on the football field and the coach said 'Dwight, I don't care how you get there, just get there.' So I started using the spin move and kept going with it and it became a natural thing.\"\n\nIt changed Freeney's image forever.\n\nHe finished his 11-year career in Indianapolis with a franchise-record 107 1/2 sacks, a number only Mathis has surpassed, and embraced the simple celebration of a salute.\n\nAfter the 2012 season, Freeney left the Colts and headed to San Diego for two seasons. He spent his final three NFL seasons bouncing from Arizona to Atlanta to Seattle and finally Detroit before retiring where it all began, Indianapolis, in April 2018.\n\nThe final tally: 350 tackles, 125 1/2 sacks, 47 forced fumbles, seven double-digit sack seasons, seven Pro Bowl appearances, three All-Pro selections and one Super Bowl ring.\n\nYet for Freeney and his teammates, it was never about the numbers or awards. All they ever wanted to do was to prove to the doubters the Colts could win their way.\n\n\"Dwight deserves everything he's getting,\" former receiver and current Colts assistant Reggie Wayne said of the first defensive teammate he's seen enter the Hall of Fame. \"We knew if we scored enough points, Dwight was going to be able to cut it loose. We knew on third down Dwight was going to make a play for us. We knew those guys were going to go after the quarterback to get the ball back, especially Dwight with the spin.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news

He took full advantage of his speed, his innovative moves and used the motivation of proving those doubters wrong all the way to a 16-year Hall of Fame career. He will be presented by Colts owner Jim Irsay, who is expected to be in a wheelchair after being injured in a fall.\n\n\"We all believed Dwight had the ability to be a force in the league,\" Polian told The Associated Press. \"The spin move was one Dwight executed perfectly and really perfected, so it was fine with us. But his base move was the bull rush, and he was so strong and fast he could run by most slow offensive tackles and guys who weren't as strong.\"\n\nPolian, the Hall of Fame executive, simply followed the plan.\n\nAfter creating the blueprint that produced four straight AFC titles in Buffalo, Polian spent his early years in Indianapolis putting together an offense around Peyton Manning. By the time Dungy arrived in 2002, he wanted defensive players who could wreak havoc on opponents and the speedy Freeney fit the bill perfectly.\n\nDungy concurred. So when draft analysts immediately branded the selection as the dreaded reach, the Colts shrugged it off.\n\nFreeney did not.\n\n\"I always had to bring my A-plus game,\" he said at his retirement ceremony. \"The Jonathan Ogdens, the Drew Breeses, the Tom Bradys, those guys made me bring my A-plus game every time. It raised my competitive nature to places I never knew existed.\"\n\nThe Colts found out how special Freeney would be quickly.\n\nDungy moved the former Syracuse star into the starting lineup midway through his rookie season, thanks to his routine penchant for embarrassing offensive linemen, harassing quarterbacks, forcing turnovers and wrecking games.\n\nBy the end of that season, Freeney had 46 tackles and nine forced fumbles, both of which became career bests, and 13 sacks -- one more than eventual AP Defensive Rookie of the Year Julius Peppers, whom Carolina took with the No. 2 overall draft pick that April. Peppers also will be inducted Saturday though Freeney is scheduled to speak first.\n\nOver those next 10 seasons, Freeney changed the game and Indy's image with the help of a virtual carbon copy pass rusher, Robert Mathis, who arrived in 2003.\n\nThat tag-team tandem quickly emerged as one of the NFL's most feared pass-rushing duos, making Freeney even more dangerous. Freeney won the league's sacks title in 2004 with 16. Two years later, Freeney and Mathis were the key components on Indy's Super Bowl-winning defense.\n\nThey didn't just challenge one another, they outmaneuvered opponents by learning one another's strengths and showing younger defensive teammates how to compete.\n\n\"He always wanted to race,\" former Colts linebacker and current assistant coach Cato June said, referring to Freeney. \"He was super fast and wanted to be the best athlete on the field. So you have these battles and you have this young Robert Mathis, who's just as fast. Those are the first interactions you have and then when you see a guy just day in and day out become an un-blockable beast, it's like wow!\"\n\nFreeney's impact on the sport was boundless.\n\nThe move he developed almost as a lark in high school was suddenly mimicked everywhere -- to the chagrin of traditional coaches who long complained it was not a proper technique.\n\nIn Indianapolis, all Freeney's teammates and coaches cared about was that it worked -- even if Freeney wasn't playing the sport exactly by the book.\n\n\"I used to get called for traveling all day (in basketball), so I couldn't really do the basketball thing,\" he said. \"So I got on the football field and the coach said 'Dwight, I don't care how you get there, just get there.' So I started using the spin move and kept going with it and it became a natural thing.\"\n\nIt changed Freeney's image forever.\n\nHe finished his 11-year career in Indianapolis with a franchise-record 107 1/2 sacks, a number only Mathis has surpassed, and embraced the simple celebration of a salute.\n\nAfter the 2012 season, Freeney left the Colts and headed to San Diego for two seasons. He spent his final three NFL seasons bouncing from Arizona to Atlanta to Seattle and finally Detroit before retiring where it all began, Indianapolis, in April 2018.\n\nThe final tally: 350 tackles, 125 1/2 sacks, 47 forced fumbles, seven double-digit sack seasons, seven Pro Bowl appearances, three All-Pro selections and one Super Bowl ring.\n\nYet for Freeney and his teammates, it was never about the numbers or awards. All they ever wanted to do was to prove to the doubters the Colts could win their way.\n\n\"Dwight deserves everything he's getting,\" former receiver and current Colts assistant Reggie Wayne said of the first defensive teammate he's seen enter the Hall of Fame. \"We knew if we scored enough points, Dwight was going to be able to cut it loose. We knew on third down Dwight was going to make a play for us. We knew those guys were going to go after the quarterback to get the ball back, especially Dwight with the spin.\"\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

Those are the first interactions you have and then when you see a guy just day in and day out become an un-blockable beast, it's like wow!\"\n\nFreeney's impact on the sport was boundless.\n\nThe move he developed almost as a lark in high school was suddenly mimicked everywhere -- to the chagrin of traditional coaches who long complained it was not a proper technique.\n\nIn Indianapolis, all Freeney's teammates and coaches cared about was that it worked -- even if Freeney wasn't playing the sport exactly by the book.\n\n\"I used to get called for traveling all day (in basketball), so I couldn't really do the basketball thing,\" he said. \"So I got on the football field and the coach said 'Dwight, I don't care how you get there, just get there.' So I started using the spin move and kept going with it and it became a natural thing.\"\n\nIt changed Freeney's image forever.\n\nHe finished his 11-year career in Indianapolis with a franchise-record 107 1/2 sacks, a number only Mathis has surpassed, and embraced the simple celebration of a salute.\n\nAfter the 2012 season, Freeney left the Colts and headed to San Diego for two seasons. He spent his final three NFL seasons bouncing from Arizona to Atlanta to Seattle and finally Detroit before retiring where it all began, Indianapolis, in April 2018.\n\nThe final tally: 350 tackles, 125 1/2 sacks, 47 forced fumbles, seven double-digit sack seasons, seven Pro Bowl appearances, three All-Pro selections and one Super Bowl ring.\n\nYet for Freeney and his teammates, it was never about the numbers or awards. All they ever wanted to do was to prove to the doubters the Colts could win their way.\n\n\"Dwight deserves everything he's getting,\" former receiver and current Colts assistant Reggie Wayne said of the first defensive teammate he's seen enter the Hall of Fame. \"We knew if we scored enough points, Dwight was going to be able to cut it loose. We knew on third down Dwight was going to make a play for us. We knew those guys were going to go after the quarterback to get the ball back, especially Dwight with the spin.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news

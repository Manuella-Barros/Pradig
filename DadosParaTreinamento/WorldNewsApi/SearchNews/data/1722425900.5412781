Abubakar Usman, Public Relations Officer of the command disclosed in a statement signed for the Controller. Abubakar, a Chief Superintendent of Customs (CSC), said the Customs boss got the royal endorsement following a visit he made to the palace of the Oba. The visit, according to him, was as part of customs community relations effort to achieve host communities support for government fiscal policies and compliance by members of the trading community. Speaking during the courtesy visit, Comptroller Olomu emphasized the critical role of traditional institutions in promoting and supporting fiscal compliance; while also conveying warm greetings from the Comptroller-General of Customs, CGC Bashir Adewale Adeniyi. \u201cWe are here to seek your royal blessings and to solicit your support in ensuring that your subjects and stakeholders comply fully with government fiscal policies,\u201d Olomu stated. Speaking further, he said, \u201cThe Nigerian Customs Service is expected to generate a total of N5.1 trillion in the fiscal year 2024, with the Apapa area command responsible for generating N2.3 trillion of that amount. This underscores the importance of Lagos and Apapa port to our nation\u2019s economy, \u201d he said. Olomu explained that collaboration with traditional institutions is essential to achieving the projected revenue and ensuring the successful implementation of government policies. He also highlighted the need to minimize the smuggling of adulterated drugs, which poses a significant threat to public health and safety. Oba Akinolu expressed satisfaction with the Customs Service\u2019s efforts and called for stricter measures to combat the smuggling of prohibited and adulterated drugs into the country. \u201cSmuggling of drugs, adulterated or substandard, poses a great threat to our nation,\u201d Oba Akinolu stated. \u201cThe havoc it wreaks on our people is immense. We must continue to educate and appeal to our citizens to understand the dangers of these illicit activities. The Nigerian Customs Service, under your leadership, plays a pivotal role in this fight, \u201d the monarch said. The Oba praised the efforts and collaboration of the NCS and the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), highlighting their excellent performance in combating drug smuggling. He assured Olomu of his unwavering support, saying, \u201cI assure you of my support any time, any day. May God Almighty take care of the officers under your command and prepare you adequately for your future endeavors.\u201d Oba Akinolu also advised the officers to prepare for their future by educating their children and maintaining their health. \u201cEducate your children and look after your health. I am 81 years old now, and it is by God\u2019s grace. God will also do it for you,\u201d he remarked. The visit concluded with mutual assurances of cooperation and commitment to fighting the menace of drug smuggling, ensuring the safety and well-being of the Nigerian populace. Olomu had recently visited the Oba of Ijora, Oba Fatai Aromire as part of efforts to strengthen customs community relations, which the monarch noted to be the first of its kind visit to his palace in the last thirty years.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/olomu44.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/olomu44.jpg 1080w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/olomu44-300x225.jpg 300w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/olomu44-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/olomu44-768x576.jpg 768w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/olomu44-86x64.jpg 86w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" /></div>\u2026Monarch Calls For End To\u00a0 Drug Abuse, Peddling.

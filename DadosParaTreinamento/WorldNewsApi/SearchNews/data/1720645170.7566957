Cruise ship tracking data reveals that the vessel briefly turned around in the narrow channel shortly after the incident occurred.\u2014 LoraForAlabama (@LoraForAlabama) Disturbingly, this marks the seventh instance of a person going overboard from an MSC cruise ship in less than seven months, according to Cruise Law News. In March, another passenger named Liam Brody Wilkie Jones disappeared from the same MSC Euribia during a seven-day European cruise and is presumed dead. Just one month prior, a passenger survived after falling from the MSC Bellissima while travelling from Taiwan to Okinawa.The MSC Euribia, standing at an impressive 213 feet tall, has the capacity to accommodate more than 8,000 passengers. A ticket for the Norway cruise, during which the man tragically fell overboard on Tuesday, costs approximately $700 per person, as listed on MSC's website.", "summary": "A man in his late 50s fell overboard from the MSC Euribia cruise ship in Norway's Sognefjord.

The only thing sweeter than a tray of Starbucks menu items is a miniature tray of Starbucks items, and that\u2019s something the chain actually offers\u2026to those who know how to get them. As the tiny range isn\u2019t really advertised by the chain, it\u2019s like a behind-the-counter secret that only diehard fans know about, but we\u2019re here today to share the steps you\u2019ll need to take to get your hands on them. The first thing you\u2019ll need to do is\u2026go to Starbucks. And then\u2026go to Starbucks again. You see, the official Miniature Collection can\u2019t be acquired immediately, and it requires a fair amount of patience, as you\u2019ll need to collect stars on the Starbucks Rewards Program. Once you collect 400 stars, you\u2019ll be able to trade them in for the tiny range. \u25bc Become a member by either signing up for a Starbucks card or using the official app, and then collect stars every time you make a purchase. One star is rewarded for every 54 yen (US$0.35) spent, so you\u2019ll have to spend around 20,000 yen ($127.95) at the chain to get the miniature collection. While that might sound daunting, the chain is constantly churning out new Frappuccinos and limited-edition mugs and tumblers throughout the year, so it\u2019s an attainable goal for a regular Starbucks customer. Once you\u2019ve collected your stars, all you have to do is select the product on the official Rewards website and it\u2019ll be delivered to your registered address free of charge. Other rewards you can receive for collecting 400 stars are products like original tote bags, mugs, and ID card holders, but in our opinion, the Miniature Collection is the best choice. \u25bc First off, the set comes packaged in a beautiful box. Then there\u2019s the incredibly detailed reproduction, which mimics the items on the menu with impressive accuracy. The miniature coffee has a removable lid, and when you lift it off, the inside looks just like black coffee. Everything, from the tiny tray through to the tiny serviettes, is identical to what you usually see at Starbucks. It\u2019s definitely worth the time and effort taken to earn 400 stars, and if you have a collection of figurines at home, they\u2019ll be just as thrilled to see the tiny range. Each item is made with such care and attention to detail you\u2019ll be tempted to keep them in your pocket and whip them out every time you visit Starbucks, not only to admire the side-by-side with the real items, but to watch the jaws drop on passersby. So next time you\u2019re thinking of splurging at Starbucks, you might want to consider joining up for the Rewards program. The Miniature Collection alone makes it totally worth it, but if you don\u2019t have the time or inclination to join, dont worry \u2014 you can always keep an eye on the online store for other fabulous finds, like the Kraft Paper Shopper Tote, which is a stylish take on the chain\u2019s free paper bags!

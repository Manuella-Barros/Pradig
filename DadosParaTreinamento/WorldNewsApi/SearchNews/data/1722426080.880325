The Oscar-winning director attended a live taping of Josh Horowitz\u2019s Happy Sad Confused podcast at the 92nd Street Y in New York City, alongside his Horizon: An American Saga co-stars Sam Worthington, Abbey Lee and Luke Wilson. During the wide-ranging conversation, Costner opened up about writing fully fleshed-out characters, particularly women, that aren\u2019t typically seen in Westerns. \u201cWhen you start writing you go, \u2018Where\u2019s the woman?\u2019 It just drove the story in every plot line,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just seemed to me to be so easy. I mean, I just hardly couldn\u2019t conceive of a scene that didn\u2019t involve women or a young girl raised by a strong woman.\u201d While castmember Sienna Miller wasn\u2019t able to attend the podcast taping, Costner sang her praises, saying that she helped bring his characters to life through her \u201cluminous\u201d acting before expressing his typical film audience. \u201cI make movies for men,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do. But I won\u2019t make a movie unless I have strong women characters, and that\u2019s how I\u2019ve conducted my career. And I think that\u2019s why I have a good following. I thank you women for dragging your men here. It was a Western, after all.\u201d Horizon: An American Saga is the first installment in a four-part film series, with the second part set to be released in August. Parts three and four are currently in the works. Costner leads the ensemble cast of the story that takes place over the course of 15 years of pre- and post-Civil War expansion. The series marks Costner\u2019s return to directing in more than 20 years. He landed an Oscar for his directorial debut, Dances With Wolves, in 1991 and followed that with The Postman (1997) and Open Range (2003). Since then, he\u2019s focused primarily on acting in and producing projects \u2014 most recently Yellowstone, which he officially exited on June 20. When it came to Horizon: An American Saga, however, the multihyphenate told The Hollywood Reporter that he knew he had to return to the director\u2019s chair for the film series he has been working on since the 1980s. \u201cSometimes you wonder if you can still ride the bike, but what I knew was I believed so much in my story that I really was the one that needed to direct this,\u201d he told THR at the film\u2019s Los Angeles premiere on Monday. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to come away not bringing everything home that I thought the movie had a chance to deliver.\u201d He added, \u201cThere are people that are more talented than myself. I\u2019m sure that [there are] directors [who] really understand the camera, but I believe in the story, and I believe so much in it that for me I think that comes shining through my movies.\u201d Horizon: An American Saga is now in theaters.", "summary": "Kevin Costner knows his audience.

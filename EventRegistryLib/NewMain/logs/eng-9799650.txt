Just ask Deebo Samuel, who is racing through training camp with renewed vigor and the lightest frame of his career.\n\n\"It's kind of weird, for sure,\" Samuel said Wednesday. \"I remember last year, we were playing the Giants (without an injured Aiyuk), and I went to him to say, 'Bro, I never knew how weird it was not to be on the field at the same time.'\"\n\nWill they ever be on the field together again?\n\nAiyuk remains out of practice and at a stubborn impasse regarding his contract. The 49ers granted him permission to seek a trade, and the franchise would have to approve any deal.\n\nIf the Pittsburgh Steelers are Aiyuk's ideal destination outside of a 49ers' return, as a league source indicated, it would take a substantial exchange of equity to dispatch their leading receiver over their past two seasons. The Steelers' roster isn't exactly overflowing with enticing options, and future draft capital doesn't benefit the 49ers' Super Bowl push this season.\n\n\"I'll let you guys speculate on that,\" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin told reporters when vaguely asked if he'd like to add a veteran receiver.\n\nESPN reported Tuesday night that the Steelers had re-engaged on trade talks, and that the New England Patriots excused themselves from consideration while the Cleveland Browns remain interested. Aiyuk's agent, Ryan Williams, was spotted Wednesday at the Raiders' camp in Costa Mesa, Calif.\n\n\"You want resolution for sure, for him and the team,\" linebacker Fred Warner said. \"But, at the end of the day, nervous energy, there's none of that going on. We know the situation and we'll let them handle that from there.\"\n\nThe 49ers hold Aiyuk's rights for at least another season. He is slated to play out his rookie contract this year on a $14.1 million fifth-year option.\n\n\"It feels awkward, being with somebody out there for four years straight,\" Samuel added. \"But business is business, and you know how it goes.\"\n\nSamuel is two years removed from his own training camp \"hold-in,\" which ended with a three-year contract but still had him subject to the trade market before April's draft. \"I sat and talked to Kyle (Shanahan) and John (Lynch). We put that behind us,\" Samuel said. \"It's not a thought in my mind right now.\"\n\nBut it is on Aiyuk's mind, even if such business talk doesn't come up in daily chats with Samuel who charterizes them as \"just like brother talk. Regardless of what happens, he's still my guy. I love him to death, whether he's here, he's there, wherever.\"\n\nAiyuk has skipped all 12 practices, and Samuel has only taken one off (last Sunday). Offseason training at locales across the country had Samuel report to camp in the lightest shape of his NFL career. Asked how much he weighs, Samuel playfully snapped: \"Enough.\" The team lists him at 215 pounds, same as every roster since his 2019 rookie year.\n\n\"The first day I saw him when we came back, I almost didn't recognize him and said, 'Dude, you're in great shape,' \" defensive coordinator Nick Sorensen said.\n\nAdded Warner: \"You can tell he took this offseason really seriously. This means a lot to him. This obviously has been his best camp, coming in prepared and competing and showing everyone he's ready to go.\"\n\nIf Samuel hasn't been the most targeted receiver, he's been the most energetic and active. He is entering his sixth season, and it's been three years since his only All-Pro and Pro Bowl campaign. Speaking of the No. 1, that's replaced No. 19 on Samuel's jersey, which makes him look \"even slimmer,\" Warner quipped. \"He's setting himself up to have an amazing season. I'm excited for him and for us because we need him.\"\n\n\"My motivation, for sure, was losing two Super Bowls,\" Samuel said.\n\nWhether it's watching Samuel cut across his defense on a 15-yard crossing route or break free on an end-around run, Sorensen is aware of those dangers, saying: \"He's Deebo. He's a weapon anyway, but he's been looking really good.\"\n\nWarner dinged\n\nFoot irritation kept Warner from practicing for the first time this camp. \"Just a little minor something to let it relax today. Nothing major at all,\" Warner said.\n\nFilling in at middle linebacker were Curtis Robinson, while Jaylen Graham and Dee Winters also got into the action, along with veteran DeVondre Campbell.\n\nAlumni return\n\nPro Football Hall of Famers Ronnie Lott, Charles Haley and Bryant Young were joined by Brent Jones, Eric Wright, Steve Bono, Anthony Dixon and other alumni in honor of 8/7 Dwight Clark Day. Clark passed away in 2018 after a courageous battle with ALS.\n\nPractice highlights\n\nGeorge Odum had two interceptions and continues to impress as a replacement starter until Talanoa Hufanga (knee) is cleared for practice. ... Jake Moody was 2 for 3 on field-goal attempts, with one blocked. ... Malik Mustapha blitzed and stripped the ball from Josh Dobbs in the backfield. ... Ambry Thomas and Renardo Green made multiple pass breakups, following the lead of Charvarius Ward on a Purdy pass intended for Frank Darby. ... Nick Bosa and Leonard Floyd repeatedly got pressure off the edge. ... Punter Mitch Wishnowsky returned to practice after a three-day absence related to knee irritation.\n\nOwens waived injured\n\nTerique Owens, an undrafted rookie and the son of 49ers Hall of Famer Terrell Owens, was waived injured because of a hand issue. Owens auditioned for the 49ers at their local pro day in April. In other corresponding roster moves, veteran safety Erik Harris was released as the 49ers signed wide receiver Jontre Kirklin and running back Ke'Shawn Vaughn.\n\n____", "source": {"uri":

(AP) - Deebo Samuel has looked like a different person since arriving for the offseason program this spring for the San Francisco 49ers - and it's not just about his new No. 1 jersey.\n\nThe player who was an All-Pro in 2021 when he was one of the game's most dangerous playmakers is trying to get back to that form after slipping a bit the past two seasons. He came back this season at his lowest weight since entering the NFL and with the work ethic of a player with something to prove this season rather than the satisfaction of one who had already arrived.\n\n\"The first day I saw him, when he came back, I almost didn\u00b4t recognize him,\" defensive coordinator Nick Sorensen said Wednesday. \"I was like, 'Dang, dude you\u00b4re in really good shape.' That's not a knock. He looks great and he\u00b4s moving great. He\u00b4s Deebo. He\u00b4s a weapon anyway but he\u00b4s been looking really good.\"\n\nA top-flight version of Samuel is even more critical this summer for the 49ers with his running mate at receiver, Brandon Aiyuk, refusing to practice while he waits for either a long-term contract extension or a trade to another team.\n\nAiyuk, a second-team All-Pro in 2023, is on the fifth-year option worth about $14.1 million this season and wants to become the latest receiver to cash in with a long-term deal. Ten receivers before Aiyuk had signed contracts worth at least $70 million already this offseason with Justin Jefferson\u00b4s four-year, $140 million extension with Minnesota setting the top of the market.\n\nSamuel requested a trade last month and his representatives have been talking to other teams to see if there's a team that Aiyuk wants to join that is willing to pay him the money he wants and give the 49ers the compensation they need to get rid of one of their top offensive players.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel Sr. catches a pass during NFL football training camp in Santa Clara, Calif., Wednesday, July 31, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)\n\n\"It kind of feels awkward after being with somebody out there for four years straight,\" Samuel said about playing without Aiyuk. \"But it's a business. That's how it goes on the field.\"\n\nSamuel is focused more on his own play, which has looked more like the 2021 version that took the NFL by storm when he gained 1,770 yards and scored 14 TDs in a breakthrough campaign.\n\nThat earned him a three-year, $71.6 million extension the following summer after his own contentious negotiations that featured a trade request and a brief \"hold in.\"\n\nBut he hasn't gotten back to that 2021 form, having said he was \"awful\" in 2022 when he was distracted in the offseason by his contract and then playing a little better in 2023.\n\nSamuel had 1,981 yards from scrimmage and 17 TDs in those two seasons combined - barely more than he got in 2021 alone. He was intent on getting into the best shape he could in order to end a season with a Super Bowl title after losing the title game in the 2019 and 2023 seasons to Kansas City and NFC title games in 2021-22.\n\n\"My motivation was for sure losing two Super Bowls,\" he said. \"We are always there. In my mind. I\u00b4m doing everything possible to be in the best shape and being the best player and being the best version of myself to come back and continue help this team go on those runs that we know we\u00b4re capable of.\"\n\nThat has been evident since the spring when Samuel was one of the rare proven veterans who was on the field throughout the offseason program.\n\nHe has set the tone for the receivers in training camp, missing only one practice so far and playing at a high level at every chance he gets, catching the attention of his teammates.\n\n\"That number change got him looking even slimmer,\" All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner said. \"You can tell he took this offseason really serious. This means a lot to him. He\u00b4s been outstanding. This has obviously been his best camp in terms of just coming in prepared, ready to go, just competing every single day, showing his team, showing us and everyone that he\u00b4s ready to go. He\u00b4s setting himself up to have an amazing season. I\u00b4m really happy for him and obviously happy for our team because we need him.\"\n\nNOTES: First-round rookie WR Ricky Pearsall missed practice a day after hurting his shoulder. ... Warner missed practice because of foot irritation. ... The 49ers signed WR Jontre Kirklin and RB Ke\u00b4Shawn Vaughn to one-year deals.

This means a lot to him. This obviously has been his best camp, coming in prepared and competing and showing everyone he's ready to go.\"\n\nIf Samuel hasn't been the most targeted receiver, he's been the most energetic and active. He is entering his sixth season, and it's been three years since his only All-Pro and Pro Bowl campaign.

I'm excited for him and for us because we need him.\"\n\n\"My motivation, for sure, was losing two Super Bowls,\" Samuel said.\n\nWhether it's watching Samuel cut across his defense on a 15-yard crossing route or break free on an end-around run, Sorensen is aware of those dangers, saying: \"He's Deebo.

(AP) -- Deebo Samuel has looked like a different person since arriving for the offseason program this spring for the San Francisco 49ers -- and it's not just about his new No. 1 jersey.\n\nThe player who was an All-Pro in 2021 when he was one of the game's most dangerous playmakers is trying to get back to that form after slipping a bit the past two seasons. He came back this season at his lowest weight since entering the NFL and with the work ethic of a player with something to prove this season rather than the satisfaction of one who had already arrived.\n\n\"The first day I saw him, when he came back, I almost didn't recognize him,\" defensive coordinator Nick Sorensen said Wednesday. \"I was like, 'Dang, dude you're in really good shape.' That's not a knock. He looks great and he's moving great. He's Deebo. He's a weapon anyway but he's been looking really good.\"\n\nA top-flight version of Samuel is even more critical this summer for the 49ers with his running mate at receiver, Brandon Aiyuk, refusing to practice while he waits for either a long-term contract extension or a trade to another team.\n\nAiyuk, a second-team All-Pro in 2023, is on the fifth-year option worth about $14.1 million this season and wants to become the latest receiver to cash in with a long-term deal. Ten receivers before Aiyuk had signed contracts worth at least $70 million already this offseason with Justin Jefferson's four-year, $140 million extension with Minnesota setting the top of the market.\n\nSamuel requested a trade last month and his representatives have been talking to other teams to see if there's a team that Aiyuk wants to join that is willing to pay him the money he wants and give the 49ers the compensation they need to get rid of one of their top offensive players.\n\n\"It kind of feels awkward after being with somebody out there for four years straight,\" Samuel said about playing without Aiyuk. \"But it's a business. That's how it goes on the field.\"\n\nSamuel is focused more on his own play, which has looked more like the 2021 version that took the NFL by storm when he gained 1,770 yards and scored 14 TDs in a breakthrough campaign.\n\nThat earned him a three-year, $71.6 million extension the following summer after his own contentious negotiations that featured a trade request and a brief \"hold in.\"\n\nBut he hasn't gotten back to that 2021 form, having said he was \"awful\" in 2022 when he was distracted in the offseason by his contract and then playing a little better in 2023.\n\nSamuel had 1,981 yards from scrimmage and 17 TDs in those two seasons combined -- barely more than he got in 2021 alone. He was intent on getting into the best shape he could in order to end a season with a Super Bowl title after losing the title game in the 2019 and 2023 seasons to Kansas City and NFC title games in 2021-22.\n\n\"My motivation was for sure losing two Super Bowls,\" he said. \"We are always there. In my mind. I'm doing everything possible to be in the best shape and being the best player and being the best version of myself to come back and continue help this team go on those runs that we know we're capable of.\"\n\nThat has been evident since the spring when Samuel was one of the rare proven veterans who was on the field throughout the offseason program.\n\nHe has set the tone for the receivers in training camp, missing only one practice so far and playing at a high level at every chance he gets, catching the attention of his teammates.\n\n\"That number change got him looking even slimmer,\" All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner said. \"You can tell he took this offseason really serious. This means a lot to him. He's been outstanding. This has obviously been his best camp in terms of just coming in prepared, ready to go, just competing every single day, showing his team, showing us and everyone that he's ready to go. He's setting himself up to have an amazing season. I'm really happy for him and obviously happy for our team because we need him.\"\n\nNOTES: First-round rookie WR Ricky Pearsall missed practice a day after hurting his shoulder. ...

Aiyuk has been vocal all offseason about his desire for a new contract that would position him among the highest-paid receivers in the league.\n\nWith trade rumors intensifying and the likelihood of Aiyuk joining a new team for the 2024 season growing, it's important to emphasize that Aiyuk will be worth the substantial cost that any team willing to acquire him will incur.\n\n\"You know, it's kind of weird for sure,\" Deebo Samuel remarked.\n\n\"I remember last year when we played the Giants I went to him and I was like 'Bruh I never knew how weird it was for you not to not be on the field at the same time' and the time I was out and he was out there by himself, [he] was just like 'I kind of see what you feel, it kind of felt awkward.\"\n\nThe 49ers retain Aiyuk's rights for at least one more season, as he is set to play out his rookie contract this year on a $14.1 million fifth-year option.\n\nAiyuk has missed all 12 practices, while Samuel has only missed one (last Sunday). Samuel arrived at camp in the best shape of his NFL career thanks to offseason training across the country. When asked about his weight, Samuel jokingly responded, \"Enough.\" The team lists him at 215 pounds, consistent with every roster since his 2019 rookie season.\n\nBrotherly love between Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk\n\n\"I still talk to him every day. He's in meetings, we still chop it up and not even about the things that are going on, but just like brother talk. Regardless of whatever happens, that's still my guy, love him to death whether he here or he there or wherever. But you know, like I just said, business is business and just going out there and I can only control the things I can control and so I just go out there and do the best I can at my job,\" Samuel said.\n\nPresident of Football Operations and General Manager John Lynch, along with Coach Kyle Shanahan, have consistently expressed their intention to retain Aiyuk for the upcoming season and beyond. However, the final decision rests with Aiyuk himself.\n\nThe focus now shifts to waiting for a trade. Although Aiyuk will command a hefty price, he's definitely worth it. The 49ers' decision to hold onto him for so long highlights his value, and they're about to reap the benefits, making this trade one of the offseason's most significant transactions.\n\nSamuel understands that no matter how Aiyuk's situation unfolds, he will always have a lifelong bond with his current 49ers teammate.

They're sticking at $26 million per year, which is below his market value.\n\nThe 49ers think Aiyuk is immature and want to take him down a peg.\n\nMeanwhile, the Steelers want to build him up and have him set the standard and the culture on their team. Their current no. 1 wide receiver, George Pickens, refuses to block. Aiyuk is one of the best blocking wide receivers in the NFL. So he can show the Steelers offense what an All Pro plays like.\n\nIn addition, the Steelers head coach, Mike Tomlin, is the opposite of 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan. Tomlin is a true player's coach who will make Aiyuk feel special and important. Shanahan plays favorites, and it's clear Aiyuk is not one of his favorites. Deebo Samuel is his favorite player on the team -- they're dear friends. They talk to each other every day during practice. So Samuel gets treatment and privileges and targets in big games that Aiyuk doesn't get.\n\nIt's not that the Steelers are offering so much more money than the 49ers or that their offense is better than the 49ers.

Mandatory Credit: D. Ross Cameron-USA TODAY Sports / D. Ross Cameron-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFormer South Carolina Gamecock wide receiver Deebo Samuel will be impacted if Brandon Aiyuk is tarded by the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe rumor mill has been running hot on the NFL landscape as of late as it seems the potential of wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk being traded by the San Francisco 49ers is becoming more and more likely. If he is indeed shipped to another team, one player that will be immediately impacted is former South Carolina Gamecock Deebo Samuel.\n\nSamuel and Aiyuk have both been focal points of the 49ers offense over the last few seasons. Both are very versatile athletes that can used in all facets of the game. In 2023, Aiyuk finished with 1,342 yards off of 75 receptions for seven touchdowns. Samuel finished with 60 receptions for 892 yards and seven touchdowns along with 225 rushing yards and five touchdowns. Two highly involved receivers in head coach Kyle Shanahan's offense, but if Aiyuk is traded off of the team, it will open the door for Samuel to get more touches.\n\nThe 49ers do have a very versatile running back in the form of Christian McCaffery, so some touches can be allocated to him, but as far as the receiving game goes, it is likely Samuel would become the main guy in the offense. Samuel is entering his sixth season in the league and all of them have been with the 49ers. He is very familiar with the offense and will be a good player for the offense to rely on to help make up for the loss of Aiyuk.\n\nSo while losing Aiyuk would be a tough pill to swallow for 49ers fans, Samuel providing a safety blanket should help maintain any confidence in the success in the team. Multiple trade rumors have been spewed out over the last week so it seems like it is only a matter of time before a trade becomes official. And when/if it happens, Samuel will have the opportunity to be one of the most productive players in all of the NFL.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deebo_Samuel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deebo Samuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Gamecocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina Gamecocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5184,h_2916,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/gamecock_digest/01j4szr6jv3jj1h4tnzr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799650", "eventUri": "eng-9799650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

How does SF offensive line look without Trent Williams? What do you want to see in first preseason game?", "body": "The San Francisco 49ers are far enough into training camp that it's almost time for their first preseason game. And still, there's no resolution to the Brandon Aiyuk drama. And nothing new came to light in the Trent Williams holdout either. So the team will move forward without the two All-Pro players. And while both situations will likely be resolved before the regular season begins, there are no guarantees.\n\nWe opened the 49ers Webzone Mailbag to see what was on your mind this week, and to no one's surprise, there were some Aiyuk and Williams questions. So let's jump in and look at those and the others.\n\nThat's the 30 million dollar question. The Cleveland Browns and New England Patriots are no longer in the race. Aiyuk doesn't want to play for either team. But a trade with the Pittsburgh Steelers is still a viable option.\n\nAccording to Senior NFL Writer for The Athletic, Dianna Russini, \"The 49ers, to this point, haven't been satisfied with the Steelers' offers and would like a receiver in return for Aiyuk as part of a trade, although they are open to players at other positions, league sources said.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Russini reported that the Steelers, \"along with other teams, are in communication and STILL negotiating with the 49ers for Brandon Aiyuk. No deal is done, per sources.\" Who are the other teams? It sounds like the 49ers may be looking to get back a player who can help them in 2024 (as they should), and that Pittsburgh isn't offering any player San Francisco wants. Perhaps the 49ers can find a third team to enter the deal to find that player.\n\nI hope it ends soon. My concern is that it's becoming a distraction in the locker room. There have already been rumors that Kyle Shanahan is frustrated by this. And Aiyuk admitted to enjoying the attention. If Shanahan is frustrated or distracted by it, others likely are.\n\nI've said all offseason that I do not believe the 49ers will trade Aiyuk. It doesn't make sense to do so. They won't be as good in 2024 without him. I'm going to stand by what I've believed and say that Aiyuk will be with the team this season. But I'm not very confident in my prediction.\n\nRegardless, I don't see a happy ending to this. Aiyuk either stays and isn't happy about not being paid. Or the 49ers cave and pay him more than they want. Or Aiyuk is traded, which won't end well for anyone except for the team that lands Aiyuk.\n\nI'm not sure it's sneaky or smart of the 49ers to trade Aiyuk so they can see how well QB Brock Purdy performs without his favorite target. I doubt they're considering that at all right now. But if they trade Aiyuk, they will get to see how Purdy looks without his All-Pro wide receiver. And perhaps that will help them better understand whether or not Purdy is worthy of the massive contract he's currently on course to receive.\n\nIt feels like we're getting close to some kind of resolution to the Aiyuk situation. But so far, it's been crickets on the Williams holdout. Let's hope the 49ers and their All-World tackle get things figured out soon.\n\nSome days they look good and some days they don't. It's safe to say they need Williams. But there have also been a lot of changes to the rest of the offensive line throughout training camp. This is due to injuries and Williams' absence. Offensive lines need time to gel, and with a lot of changes, that can take time.\n\nNone of the injuries appear to be major, so they should be getting more consistent looks as we get closer to week one. Williams is the biggest question mark, but there are also questions about what happens at center and right guard.\n\nDominick Puni has been getting first-team reps at right guard. Would he still be receiving those reps if Spencer Burford wasn't injured? Probably not, but he's looked good in his reps, so he's certainly doing his part to take over that spot.\n\nThe most important thing I want to see is no injuries. The 49ers are already banged up, so we need them to get through this game without any major injuries.\n\nAfter health, it's all about the young players, especially the rookies and second-year guys who didn't play much as rookies. How will Puni look on Saturday? How about some of the young wide receivers and defensive backs? Very few of the regular starters will play on Saturday, so the young guys and backups will get a shot to showcase what they can do.\n\nFinally, it will be interesting to see what the backup quarterbacks do. Josh Dobbs and Brandon Allen are fighting for that number two spot behind Purdy. Who will step up? Will Tanner Mordecai get in the game, and if he does, how will he look? Can he do what Purdy did two seasons ago?\n\nI predict the 49ers starting offensive line in week one against the New York Jets (on Monday Night Football) will be:\n\nLT Williams, LG Aaron Banks, C Jake Brendel, RG Jon Feliciano, RT Colton McKivitz\n\nIf I was running the show, the 49ers would probably have the top overall draft pick every year. That said, here's how I'd like to see the offensive line for week one:\n\nLT Williams, LG Aaron Banks, C Feliciano, RG Puni, RT Colton McKivitz\n\nBut I realize it may be too much to ask of Puni to start in week one, on Monday Night Football, against an excellent Jets defense. So I could be swayed to stick with the same lineup that started the Super Bowl. And that's probably what's going to happen.\n\nDo you mean other than giving Kyle Juszczyk the nickname, \"Juice?\" Sorry, that was a lie.

According to Bleacher Report's Jordan Schultz, Aiyuk and the organization recently had a frank conversation and have restarted contract talks.\n\n\"The two sides have since restarted negotiations on a long-term deal and there is some optimism that Aiyuk could remain in SF,\" Schultz tweeted in part Friday afternoon.\n\nWhile Schultz makes clear the situation remains \"fluid,\" the top buzzword of this saga, but Aiyuk could try to hammer out a long-term deal with the 49ers instead of being dealt.\n\nNFL Network's Tom Pelissero offers the same reporting and says Aiyuk staying in San Francisco is \"increasingly possible.\"\n\nTo date, the 49ers and Aiyuk have had contracts stall throughout the offseason. Reportedly, San Francisco's top offer has been for $26 million per year, a number they submitted before the receiver market heated up this offseason with several big-name wideouts getting deals done. Despite that, the team hadn't shifted their figure. Aiyuk is reportedly searching for at least $28 million per season, which would make him a top-five paid receiver or just right outside that class.\n\nPittsburgh has been seen as one of the most interested parties for Aiyuk and the top place he'd like to be traded to But trade compensation to the 49ers has been an obstacle, San Francisco reportedly wanted back a wide receiver to lessen the blow for losing Aiyuk. At last reporting, the Steelers were waiting to hear back from the 49ers on how they wanted to proceed. Other reports indicated San Francisco was searching for a third team to get involved and trade them a receiver, setting up a rare three-team trade in the NFL.\n\nNow, the 49ers may be making the calculation that paying Aiyuk a little more is better than trading him for a little less. As always, stay tuned, but after months of debating where he'll be traded, the answer could be nowhere.\n\nRelated Items:Brandon Aiyuk, Jordan Schultz, Tom Pelissero, Trending Recommended for you Steelers Place OLB Markus Golden On Reserve/Retired List T.J.

The 49ers were the top team in the NFC during the 2023-24 season and advanced to Super Bowl 58. They took a 25-22 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs but retained elite talent to run things back. Brock Purdy and Deebo Samuel are two offensive contributors vital to SF's attack. However, Samuel made an eye-opening film admission ahead of the 2024 preseason play.\n\nWhen asked if he and Purdy watch tape together, Samuel gave this response:\n\n\"No,\" Samuel replied, via 95.7 The Game on X (formerly Twitter).\"\n\nHowever, after a brief stare with reporters, Samuel began laughing and said \"Yeah for sure.\"\n\n\"That's Kyle [Shanahan's] job man. Kyle handles the quarterbacks,\" Samuel joked.\n\nFor a duo that allegedly does not watch film together, Deebo Samuel and Brock Purdy clean up quite nicely.\n\nPurdy had an impressive year in 2023-24 in just his second season with the 49ers. The former Iowa State Cyclone amassed 4,280 yards, 31 touchdowns, and boasted a 72.8 QBR, all of which were top-five NFL rankings. Purdy came up huge for San Francisco in the postseason, leading comebacks against the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions before helping his team advance to the Super Bowl.\n\nSamuel was nearly as impressive.\n\nHe joined SF three years before Purdy and made an immediate impact. Samuel experienced a breakout year during the 2021 season, amassing a career-high 1,405 yards along with six touchdowns. He has not experienced the same success since then but remains a key target. The 28-year-old accumulated 892 yards and seven touchdowns in 2023-24.\n\n49ers bolstering roster despite trade rumors\n\nOne of the major stories following San Francisco is the status of Brandon Aiyuk. Aiyuk is rumored to be on the move after negotiations between him and management on a new contract have reportedly stalled. Nevertheless, the 49ers plan on bringing in a serviceable roster upgrade.\n\nSan Francisco and former Detroit Lions safety Tracy Walker are working on finalizing a deal, Ari Meirov reported. Walker had a workout with SF on Wednesday and is expected to sign with the team. He should add sound depth to an already impressive defense. Still, there be will questions about the team's offense if Brandon Aiyuk is traded.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the 49ers handle this crucial period as they begin preseason play.

He wants to get traded to the Steelers and a deal seems inevitable. But for now, he's still on the 49ers.\n\nSo when I asked Deebo Samuel on Wednesday about Jauan Jennings' stellar offseason, his answer surprised me.\n\n\"I wouldn't even say he has improved,\" Samuel explained. \"Jauan has been the most consistent receiver that we have day in and day out as far as blocking and making plays. That's why we call it third-and-Jauan. He's in better shape. His ball skills have gotten way better. Every time you see him out there, he's giving everything he's got on every route, on every play.\"\n\nTranslation: Jennings is a more consistent wide receiver than Brandon Aiyuk, who thinks he's the best wide receiver on the team. That's why when it's third down, the money down, the got-to-have-it down, Brock Purdy trusts Jennings more than anyone.\n\nThis may or may not be true. But it's worth noting that this summer when Brandon Aiyuk was lobbying to become the highest-paid offensive player on the 49ers, he did so at the expense of Samuel. Went on The Pivot Podcast and smiled and nodded when all the various hosts said he was the best pure wide receiver on the 49ers.\n\nI'm guessing Samuel watched that interview, took exception to Aiyuk's comments and was more than happy to praise Jennings at Aiyuk's expense.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jauan_Jennings", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jauan Jennings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deebo_Samuel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deebo Samuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5184,h_2916,x_0,y_65/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_49ers/01j4r49j0gpd2eh8tkpr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799650", "eventUri": "eng-9799650", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

It feels like it's been Groundhog's Day for a week now whenever we talk about San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk.\n\nInterested parties seem to be dwindling. We're on Day 5 of the 49ers allegedly sending Aiyuk to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Could part of the reason be that Aiyuk doesn't actually want to go anywhere? ESPN's Adam Schefter believes so:\n\n\"I think there's a part of him that would still like to stay in San Francisco. The problem is, there's been so much that has transpired, that that's become more and more difficult. Like, this is a deal that could have and should have been done. At one point, it looked like the two sides were getting a deal done in the offseason, and it didn't get done, and here we are where all this other 'scar tissue,' if you will, has built up and complicated the situation and turned it into a real-life soap opera.\"\n\nThere have been tweets and rumors about potential players that the Steelers would send to the 49ers in exchange for Aiyuk. Schefter said, \"Pittsburgh's not giving up George Pickens for Brandon Aiyuk. Pittsburgh's not giving up Pat Friermuth for Brandon Aiyuk. Certain things are not realistic.\"\n\nThe 49ers have softened their stance on replacing Aiyuk with a wideout in any potential trade. But, based on this next blurb from Schefter explains why both sides remain at a stalemate:\n\nI think that in any trade...if you're subtracting an elite wide receiver off a Super Bowl-caliber roster, you'd want to try to replace that player as much as you could,\" Schefter said. \"So, who could and would do that? Pittsburgh doesn't have a receiver they can give to the Niners to make up for that.\"\n\nPittsburgh traded away Dionte Johnson in the offseason, so there really aren't any other pass catchers that move the needle. Outside of one of their two rookie offensive lineman, Alex Highsmith or Joey Porter, it's difficult to pinpoint a player who is in the same stratosphere as Aiyuk on their roster -- T.J.

In fact, Jauan Jennings -- a receiver who would be seeing a much larger role should Aiyuk end up being traded -- has been thriving.\n\nAccording to All-Pro wide receiver Deebo Samuel, one of the most respected voices in the 49ers locker room, Jennings has proved to be the most consistent wideout in camp. Considering the source, this is lofty praise for the 27-year-old Jennings, as Samuel typically hasn't been a player known for seeking headline splashes by saying things he doesn't truly believe.\n\nHere's what Deebo had to say about Jennings following Wednesday's practice.\n\n\"I wouldn't even say he's improved,\" Samuel said. \"Jauan has been the most consistent receiver that we have. Day in and day out, as far as blocking, going out and making plays, that's why we call it 'third-and-Jauan.' Just coming in in better shape, ball skills gotten way better. Every time you see Jauan out there he's giving everything he's got, every route, every play.\"\n\nJudging by all accounts, Jennings has absolutely been making the most of the extra targets he's been seeing and generally had an outstanding training camp, but this is quite the glowing endorsement and hearing such words from Samuel probably lands a little differently for the fourth-year pro.\n\nWhile Jennings has become well known for routinely making clutch catches, hence the nickname of \"Third and Jauan,\" his role with the 49ers offense has been understandably limited with Aiyuk and Samuel in front of him on the depth chart, in addition to the presence of tight end George Kittle and star running back Christian McCaffrey, who both see plenty of targets.\n\nHaving said all of that, if the 49ers do end up dealing Aiyuk to one of his many suitors, Jennings seeing a major uptick in receptions -- he's averaged just 26 catches in his first three seasons -- would hardly be a shocking development.\n\nFor the many 49ers fans who badly want Aiyuk to remain with the team but who also see the inevitable writing on the wall, Jennings stepping into a breakout season as WR No. 2 would probably be the best \"glass-half-full\" approach to a possible Aiyuk departure.", "source": {"uri": "49erswebzone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "49ers Webzone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_ryan@49erswebzone.com", "name": "Tim Ryan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jauan_Jennings", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jauan Jennings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deebo_Samuel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deebo Samuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_McCaffrey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian McCaffrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kittle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Kittle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special_Needs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special Needs", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://static.49erswebzone.com/v/bvDVSm/content/media/article/07e7af536611c9f39e0ac8dbcfce6f8c.jpg?social=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799650", "eventUri": "eng-9799650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

He tweeted that the San Francisco 49ers have made a renewed effort in recent days to strike a long-term deal with Aiyuk. Although the situation is fluid, and other teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers remain in the mix, a return to San Francisco appears increasingly possible.\n\nPelissero's follow-up tweet said, \"After months of speculation, sporadic negotiations, and recent trade talks, the 49ers are pushing to get a deal done that keeps Brandon Aiyuk in San Francisco for the long haul. Nothing done, but finally, things are moving.\"\n\nUndoubtedly, Aiyuk returning to the 49ers is the best thing that could happen for all parties. They developed him into one of the top wideouts in the NFL. Now, it's that time when you reward him for what he's accomplished.\n\nUnfortunately, in this business, the box score talks about negotiations. Aiyuk is competing against players he plays the same position as, but they aren't on teams with multiple superstars on the same side of the ball.\n\nThe longer this lasts, someone will eventually blink. According to Pelissero's report, it seems like the Niners are the ones who are willing to budge first. This is also two weeks after we've seen Chris Conley start in Aiyuk's position, and the 49er's defensive backs have a stranglehold on the wideouts.\n\nAiyuk is the best wideout on the team, and everyone in the building knows that.

But between Aiyuk not wanting to go certain places and San Francisco unable to get acceptable compensation up to this point from teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers, and there hasn't been a lot of progress seemingly made on a trade.\n\nESPN's Dan Graziano said on Unsportsmanlike this morning that San Francisco wants a resolution to this whole thing \"pretty soon.\"\n\n\"It's reached a really interesting point, where the Niners look like they want a resolution pretty soon, one way or another,\" Graziano said, adding that if a team can satisfy paying Aiyuk what he wants and giving the 49ers acceptable compensation, Aiyuk will be traded.\n\nBut Graziano believes that now that Aiyuk has had a chance to survey the market, there's a chance he could come back to San Francisco and the two sides could look to negotiate to keep him a 49er.\n\n\"The Niners are at a point where they're like, ok, listen, you've had a chance to talk to some other teams about a contract, you're not hearing what you want from them either. Maybe come back to us, maybe talk about our offer again, maybe just play this out and hit free agency.\"\n\nGraziano said there's a \"non-zero\" chance that Aiyuk winds up back in San Francisco for 2024.\n\nGiven the state of the trade negotiations, where Pittsburgh doesn't seem willing to give San Francisco what they want and Aiyuk not wanting to play for the Cleveland Browns, it would have to take a third team coming in to make an offer for Aiyuk or potentially a third team helping facilitate a trade of Aiyuk to Pittsburgh. Someone with more receiver depth could take a pick from Pittsburgh and send San Francisco a receiver, as the team wants a receiver back but Pittsburgh doesn't want to deal anyone from their current roster.\n\nIt's caused things to essentially stall out, as the reporting on Aiyuk and the Steelers has remained the same for much of the last few days - he wants to go there, but Pittsburgh and San Francisco can't hammer out compensation. If that doesn't change, the 49ers won't trade him for less than they think he's worth, and Pittsburgh will likely fall out of the running.\n\nBut with a resolution wanted and expected quickly, we could hear about Aiyuk's future home in the next few days, whether it's Pittsburgh, San Francisco or elsewhere.\n\nRelated Items:Brandon Aiyuk, Dan Graziano, Trending, UnSportsmanLike Recommended for you Heyward Expecting Next Step For DeMarvin Leal Now That He 'Understands The Playbook A Lot More' Steelers Vs.

Fred Warner, Deebo Samuel and Nick Bosa, among others, are all vital parts of the 49ers' soul. Brock Purdy is accumulating credibility swiftly. And Trent Williams might be the most respected person in that locker room, but he's not in there now because he's holding out for a sweetened contract. Which is one of the disruptions that have shaken this franchise lately.\n\nThe biggest disturbance, no doubt, is the continuing standoff/stare down/pre-breakup situation between the 49ers and Brandon Aiyuk, who has requested a trade and been given permission to talk to other teams. Even if Aiyuk and the 49ers drag themselves back to the negotiating table, there are hurt feelings and hard questions for all sides.\n\nHow is the 49ers' locker room dealing with all this? Are the players wondering if owner Jed York is ready to end this era with a series of discards, which already started with the release of stalwart Arik Armstead in March? Is there discord? Is it business as usual? Who is leading the way?\n\nKyle Shanahan and John Lynch run the team, but they're not the voices of this team. I wanted to hear from one of the leaders. Somebody who went through his own rough negotiating process with the 49ers a few years ago. Someone who plays alongside Aiyuk and Williams on the 49ers' offense.\n\nGeorge, are these contractual crises a sign that this era of the 49ers might be coming to an end?\n\n\"I get asked that all the time, like, 'You guys, you can't pay everybody; you have a superstar team,'\" Kittle told me after practice on Thursday. \"Talk about a window closing and all that type of stuff. And I'm just, like, all I know is that currently, right now, we have a really good roster. And I'm just gonna try to attack it every single day with the really good roster that I have.\n\n\"I remember being told in like 2021 that, 'Hey, if we don't win it this year, the window's closed.' And we've been to three NFC Championship Games since then. So the window hasn't closed. John and Kyle and Jed (York) have done a great job about figuring out a way to, whatever metaphorical window, keep that open.\"\n\nKittle said it was a little strange early in camp when Aiyuk, who has been attending camp but not practicing, was absent from the huddle. But several weeks in, with the 49ers getting ready for their exhibition opener on Saturday in Nashville, Tenn., Kittle said everybody is just doing the work and doing their best to ignore the headlines and hullabaloo generated by the Aiyuk situation.\n\n\"Honestly, to me, it's less weird now than it was at the start,\" Kittle said. \"Aiyuk's a phenomenal football player. And with all this stuff that's happening on the outside, I mean, I have no idea. I see stuff on Instagram occasionally. I don't really watch any type of 'SportsCenter' or (sports-talk) stuff. But it doesn't really affect me at all.\n\n\"Hopefully it pans out the way that's the best possible way for both Brandon and the 49ers. And whatever happens, happens. Because I have zero control over it and there's nothing I can do about it. ... For Brandon, it's just, I want what's best or him. If he requests a trade, I hope that he gets to go somewhere that's best for him. And I have no bad blood with Brandon.\"\n\nYes, I think Kittle sounded somewhat resigned about this. Or at least his words were filled with an acceptance that things probably won't be resolved very soon. Kittle emphasized that all negotiations are different -- last year, for instance, Bosa was going to hold out until the 49ers caved, period. But it'd be na\u00efve to think that an Aiyuk trade is anything but extremely possible at any moment. And Kittle is not na\u00efve.\n\nPlus, there are young receivers like rookies Ricky Pearsall and Jacob Cowing and young veterans like Jauan Jennings, Ronnie Bell and Danny Gray who theoretically could step into the void.\n\n\"I would definitely say that it would be a significant loss,\" Kittle said. \"(Aiyuk)'s a fantastic wide receiver who does everything that you want. He runs every route tree. He makes huge plays. He gives 100-percent effort in the run game. He leads by example. He brings awesome energy every single day of work. He's everything you want in a football player. So I love having him as a teammate.\n\n\"But the one benefit to him not practicing ... is a lot of younger guys get all these reps, and they're getting important reps with the 1s and with Brock that they wouldn't be getting otherwise. I'm not going to take probably any rookie over Brandon, I'm not going to do that. But the fact that these young guys get these reps, it's going to put them in a position to succeed if we can't figure stuff out with Brandon.\"\n\nThe 49ers won't all of a sudden turn into a terrible team if Aiyuk departs. They'll still be loaded with Pro Bowl talent, from Purdy, Kittle, Deebo, Warner and Williams (presuming he and the 49ers come to terms) to Christian McCaffrey, Charvarius Ward and Kyle Juszczyk.\n\nBut they'll be less talented than they could've been, or should've been, if 49ers management hadn't misplayed the Aiyuk negotiations to this point. It will take strong leadership to get the 49ers through this. I think some of that is already happening. For the 49ers, it's about standards -- and standard bearers. And this will last as long as the talent level is high and the standards are maintained.\n\nKittle said his generation of captains mostly came of age in the 2021 season, two years after the Super Bowl trip and a year after the COVID-blighted 2020 campaign, when the 49ers also endured a flood of serious injuries, including to Jimmy Garoppolo, Kittle and Bosa. There was some roster shuffling after that horrible campaign, some of the older veterans exited, and the current wave of 49ers leaders stepped forward.\n\n\"It was me, Fred, Trent Williams and at that point it's Hey, Deebo, you're in Year 3. You've got Arik Armstead at that point, too, who was a good leader, and Bosa,\" Kittle said. \"We were kind of a young group of leaders. But we just tried to practice at a very high level every single day and set a standard that was, if you're walking into this San Francisco 49ers organization, if you get signed here, if you don't play at this level, you're going to stand out like a sore thumb on tape and you're going to be embarrassed.\"\n\nThey're going to need all of that and more from Kittle, Warner & Co. if the 49ers move on from Aiyuk. What's also understood is that Purdy, entering his second full season as the starting quarterback, is moving into a true leadership role himself. Two offseasons ago, Purdy was the established starter, but that was after only a handful of games as a rookie before he blew out his elbow in the NFC Championship Game. Purdy had to spend the entire 2023 offseason rehabbing after surgery and unsure if he was going to be ready for the 2023 season. This offseason was ... normal. Or as normal as it gets for a 24-year-old now firmly set as the 49ers' QB1.\n\n\"He went and got married,\" Kittle said of Purdy. \"He went on a honeymoon. He was able to calm down a little bit. And when you're able to do that, it kind of reignites a hunger ... you have that itch. It's like, football season's coming and I need to get in the best shape of my life and to be my best self. I feel like I saw that from Brock. When he showed up to OTAs, when I saw him, he looked like he was just ready to go. And I show up at training camp, he has the same thing. He's just hungry to get better every day.\n\n\"And when you feel that off of your starting quarterback, it makes you just want to go as well.\"\n\nBut the Purdy ascension also complicates the greater 49ers financial squeeze, because everybody in the organization understands that he's due for a $200-million-plus extension next offseason. That deal probably won't really hit the salary cap for several more years, but it'll likely necessitate York committing more than $150 million in guaranteed money. Maybe that's what's holding back the 49ers' talks with Aiyuk, maybe not. But it wouldn't be the first time that the accumulation of guaranteed money -- not the more easily manipulated cap figures -- were the true problem issue in an NFL negotiation.\n\nIt's all staring the 49ers' top veterans in the face. Armstead, a long-time captain, was released after he refused to take a pay cut, just after he went through an injury-limited season and turned 30. Shanahan and Lynch have not denied that they could move on from Samuel after this season, when he'll be 29. Kittle is entering his eighth NFL season and will turn 31 in October. He only has one more year left on his contract after this season, and the 49ers could get out of it fairly easily. Even though last year was Kittle's best, healthiest and most productive campaign since 2021 (65 catches, 1,020 yards), you never know when somebody who plays as physically as Kittle might start to wear down.\n\nIf the 49ers do some more hardline salary slicing, is it possible they think about targeting Kittle next offseason? \"For sure,\" Kittle said.\n\nIs this something on his mind?\n\n\"It's not really an issue for me,\" Kittle said. \"There's nothing I can do about that except to go out there at every single practice and every single game, show them why they need to keep me around. That's the only thing I can control. Stay healthy, make a bunch of plays, play at a high level, be a good person and win football games. And if I can just do that, I feel like I'm going to be a Niner for a really long time.\n\n\"And if I think about hey, they've done this before, you're at the end of your contract, you're 30... I don't really feel 30. ... I think I'm having a pretty good training camp. My body feels pretty good. And I'm just gonna continue to play the way that I've been playing my entire career. That's been at a pretty high level.\n\n\"I'm very aware that I'm not 23 years old anymore. But I honestly haven't been able to tell the difference between 27 and 30. I'm just going to keep going until the wheels fall off. And I feel like the way that I take care of my body, the wheels aren't going to fall off for a while, knock on wood.\"\n\nThe 49ers are going to need Kittle -- and Warner and others -- for as long as they can play like this, and for as long as they can provide counsel for the rest of the roster. But it'll get harder every time they lose a player like Armstead earlier this year, and maybe Aiyuk in a matter of hours or days. It'll all get harder. And eventually, even Kittle and Warner will be gone, too. It's harsh, but every player faces this. Every team faces this. Even the 49ers. Especially the 49ers these days.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_kawakami@nytimes.com", "name": "Tim Kawakami", "type":

However, it seems the 49ers are not satisfied with the offer on the table. As reported by Dianna Russini, Aiyuk's current team is unhappy with what the Steelers are proposing, noting that they want \"a wide receiver back in return, if possible... but they are also open to other positions.\"\n\nThe timeline has moved pretty fast for the parties involved. Just a week ago, it was reported that the 49ers will not be looking to trade their star receiver. Many analysts even pointed out that they don't need to trade him anywhere.\n\nHe is still in his contract year, and if no resolution is reached, he can simply play out this season and see what happens, similar to what Dak Prescott did with the Cowboys.\n\nThe timing is unfavorable for a trade. Under these circumstances, finding a trade scenario that satisfies Aiyuk, the 49ers, and the team he's being traded to will be a herculean task with the season just weeks away.\n\nNotably, Aiyuk turned down a $32 million offer from the Patriots, apparently due to dissatisfaction with their current QB situation. Thus, finding a team comparable to the 49ers is likely to be challenging. And for the 49ers to find a trade package that justifies this move, it also won't be easy.\n\nAiyuk's current team is an upstanding Super Bowl contender with a young and exciting QB who has already proven himself to be worthy. While moving to a team like the Steelers or the Patriots might secure Aiyuk his desired compensation, it may not be a situation he'll be entirely satisfied with.\n\nNo team, other than the Chiefs, has a core group like the 49ers. They've made it to the big game twice in the last 5 years. Once, without Aiyuk. So the 49ers might do okay without him, but Aiyuk's resume will definitely take a hit if he moves on to a worse situation.\n\nThat said, another prominent wide receiver who left to secure his bag has faded in the playoffs. Tyreek Hill, once the talk of the town as the most formidable weapon in the Kansas City Chiefs' arsenal, now only makes appearances on Twitter during January and February, as Colin Cowherd recently pointed out.\n\nDuring an episode of The Herd, Cowherd highlighted how Tyreek Hill found himself in a situation similar to Aiyuk's. Like the 49ers player, Hill was a superstar receiver on a historically successful team. However, when such a team is built, many deserving players need to be financially respected. Ultimately, Hill and the Chiefs couldn't reach a consensus.\n\nUnwilling to take less money, he packed his bag and flew down to Miami. Now, his regular season stats are still great, but during the playoffs, he is a mere social media star. Cowherd said:\n\n\"Tyreek Hill, remember when he mattered in January and February? 'Hey, but he got the bag!' But he's irrelevant when it matters now. He watches the games like all of us, on television.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the playoffs, the time when it matters the most, Hill's team is nowhere to be found. They are still finding their footing and it doesn't look like Hill is going to be in his prime much longer, having already hinted at retirement at the age of 30.\n\nSo by moving on from the Chiefs, Hill may not have himself any favors professionally.

Pittsburgh isn't going to deal from their wide receiver corps to add Aiyuk, as it's a group that needs to be upgraded, hence why the team is on Aiyuk to begin with.\n\nPittsburgh seems to be the team to beat for Aiyuk right now, but he could always stay with the 49ers on a contract extension or be traded elsewhere. Aiyuk would have to agree to sign an extension with whatever team is looking to acquire him, as no team would trade assets for Aiyuk for just one year, but the compensation also has to be enough to motivate the 49ers to move him.\n\nThe possibility of a third team getting involved to facilitate San Francisco getting a receiver for Aiyuk has been floated around, but three-team trades are incredibly hard to pull off in the NFL and that doesn't feel like a very plausible outcome. With the Steelers not giving up a player, it could lead to San Francisco asking for an increased draft compensation package for Pittsburgh, one they may not be willing to meet.\n\nThat seems like it could be a hold-up in the trade right now, as Pittsburgh won't overpay for Aiyuk and their unwillingness to move off a player could be a detriment to a win-now 49ers team. The fact that a trade hasn't happened yet despite all signs pointing toward one means that there could be a number of complications that the two sides are working through.\n\nThe saga for Aiyuk has felt like it's been nearing the end for a while now, and if San Francisco agrees to trade Aiyuk without acquiring a player, the Steelers may give up multiple day two picks in order to acquire Aiyuk. It sounds as if we'll have a resolution of some sort in the coming days or potentially hours.\n\nRelated Items:Brandon Aiyuk, Gerry Dulac, Trending Recommended for you Michael Lombardi Thinks Landing Brandon Aiyuk Could Lead To George Pickens Trade Report: 49ers Aren't Satisfied With Steelers' Offers For Aiyuk Garafolo Believes Brandon Aiyuk Will Land With Steelers 'In Relatively Short Order'", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_clark@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Joe Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BrandonAiyukStock10.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799650", "eventUri": "eng-9799650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

So quarterback Russell WIlson wouldn't be a fair trade.\n\nAccording to Jim Wexell who covers the Steelers, the 49ers are looking for two first round picks.\n\nIf you ask why two first rounders, I'll speculate productivity, age, and the fifth year option + franchise tag before a deal even is needed. Plus it's Brandon Aiyuk.\n\nOh and one other thing: No matter what compensation, the team that lands Brandon Aiyuk wins the Brandon Aiyuk trade. Why? Because that team has Brandon Aiyuk. Two first round picks soften that blow.\n\nIf you were doing a deal with the 49ers what would you give up to add Brandon Aiyuk to your team?

Mandatory Credit: Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers have reportedly been trying to find a way to acquire star wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk, but they may have to improve their offer if they want to get a deal done.\n\nAccording to Dianna Russini of The Athletic, the San Francisco 49ers have not yet been satisfied with what the Steelers have offered for Aiyuk. San Francisco is said to be seeking draft capital in addition to a wide receiver or other position player.\n\nAiyuk is in the final year of his contract, so any team that acquires him would want an extension in place before completing the deal. That should not be an issue with the Steelers, as there has been talk of Aiyuk potentially accepting less money from Pittsburgh than he would another team.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns are another team that has been linked to Aiyuk, and they could potentially offer Amari Cooper as part of a trade. That might be appealing to the 49ers, as Cooper played at a high level last season with 72 catches for 1,250 yards and 5 touchdowns. The Steelers are not going to part with young wide receiver George Pickens, so they may have not have enough to match an offer from Cleveland or another team.\n\nSteelers head coach Mike Tomlin fueled the speculation about an Aiyuk trade with his cryptic response to a question this week, but the 49ers do not appear to be in any rush to make a deal.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_delvecchio@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Steve DelVecchio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi's_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Levi's Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tomlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tomlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amari Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Brandon-Aiyuk-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799650", "eventUri": "eng-9799650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

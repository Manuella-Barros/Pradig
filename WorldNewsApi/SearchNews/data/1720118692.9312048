In a statement on Saturday afternoon, Harris called on Hamas and Israel to give \"serious and positive consideration\" to Biden's ceasefire deal. Biden said on Friday that Israel had offered a new roadmap to end the conflict in Gaza, stating that \"it's time for this war to end\". The US President urged Hamas to accept the three-stage deal, which would begin with a six-week ceasefire during which Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza. There would also be a \"surge\" of humanitarian aid during this first phase in addition to the exchange of some hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The deal would eventually lead to a permanent \"cessation of hostilities\" and a major reconstruction plan for Gaza. Hamas has said that it views the deal \"positively\". \"This is truly a decisive moment,\" Biden said on Friday. \"Hamas says it wants a ceasefire. This deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it.\" The Taoiseach also reiterated Ireland's call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, calling for all hostages to be released and for aid to be allowed to enter Gaza unimpeded. He said the deal \"can move us closer to securing\" a ceasefire and aid in addition to securing the release of hostages. He also said the deal can help \"create space to build a just and lasting peace and two-state solution\". \"I call on all parties to give the plan presented by President Biden serious and positive consideration,\" Harris said in a statement on Saturday. \"This is an opportunity that should not be missed. It is long past time for the suffering to end.\" Earlier on Saturday, T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Miche\u00e1l Martin called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, stating that \"it's time to stop\". \"Now is the time for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, and unhindered humanitarian aid to desperate Palestinian civilians,\" Martin said on Saturday. Meanwhile, Ophir Falk, chief foreign policy advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Biden's deal was \"not a good deal\" but that Israel would accept it. \"It's not a good deal but we dearly want the hostages released, all of them,\" Falk said. \"There are a lot of details to be worked out,\" he added. He said Israel's demands, including \"the release of the hostages and the destruction of Hamas as a genocidal terrorist organisation\", have not changed.", "summary": "In a statement on Saturday afternoon, Harris called on Hamas and Israel to give \"serious and positive consideration\" to Biden's ceasefire deal.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.irishcentral.com/news/politics/taoiseach-hamas-israel-biden-ceasefire-plan", "image": "https://www.irishcentral.com/uploads/article-v2/2024/6/163647/thumb_MI_Simon_Harris_-_Rolling_News__2_.jpg?t=1717330765", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:19:21", "author": "IrishCentral Staff", "authors": ["IrishCentral Staff"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.014}

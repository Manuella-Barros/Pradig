{"id": 223687586, "title": "LIVE score updates from Kilkenny v Wexford, Galway v Dublin and Antrim v Carlow", "text": "Welcome Good afternoon and welcome to our live blog for this final round of round-robin fixtures in the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship. There is loads to play for in today's games, which includes a relegation decider between Antrim and Carlow. Neither of them can advance in Leinster, but the losers will be relegated, while a draw would see Carlow play Joe McDonagh Cup hurling next year. The top two teams will play in the Leinster final, with the third-placed team advancing to the preliminary All-Ireland SHC quarter-finals. Kilkenny are the only team guaranteed to advance and will qualify for the Leinster decider if they avoid defeat against Wexford, while a win for either Galway or Dublin would secure a place in the Leinster final regardless of what happens in the Kilkenny v Wexford match. You can read all the permutations here.", "summary": "The final round of Leinster Hurling Championship round-robin games take place", "url": "https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/sport/gaa/hurling/live-score-updates-kilkenny-v-29242295", "image": "https://i2-prod.belfastlive.co.uk/sport/gaa/hurling/article29242282.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_inpho_02495418.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:25:24", "author": "Robert Hynes", "authors": ["Robert Hynes"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.121}

John Fetterman wants you to know about him, it's that he's the same guy he was on the campaign trail.\n\nThe junior Democratic senator from Pennsylvania still shows up to work each day in a Carhartt hoodie and gym shorts, peppers conversation with profanity and takes potshots at the \"losers\" and \"sleazeballs\" he feels need to be called out - and he won't mince words when it comes to Israel.\n\n\"I said I dress like a slob, I dress like a slob,\" he said. \"I said I was going to stand with Israel, I stand with Israel. I said I'm going to be a reliable Democratic vote, and I'm still a reliable Democratic vote.\"\n\nThat's not how many on the left see him lately.\n\nIn the months since the Israel-Hamas war began, Fetterman has become one of his party's most outspoken supporters of Israel.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHe's on an island apart from his Democratic peers, most of whom have attempted to strike a balance between supporting Israel's interest in self defense while condemning the carnage that has come from its airstrikes and ground invasion on the Gaza Strip, which have killed more than 34,500 people and created dire humanitarian conditions for those who remain. He's also become a vocal critic of the pro-Palestine protests that have popped up on college campuses around the country in response.\n\nFetterman's position has come as a shock to progressives who championed him on the trail in 2022, when he became the only Democrat to flip a seat in the upper chamber. The campaign drew legions of left-leaning admirers who saw him as a populist rising star in line with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders - people who now call him a \"betrayal,\" a \"flip-flopper\" and a \"jagoff.\"\n\nIn an exclusive interview with USA TODAY last week, Fetterman argued those assumptions were wrong from the start, and that he signaled his \"unwavering\" support for Israel well before he was elected.\n\n\"I am not a progressive,\" he said. \"I've been saying that for years. I just don't identify with that label. But I'm still a Democrat and someone you can count on.\"\n\nFormer supporters, frustrated with his public rejection of the label, point to social media posts that suggest otherwise.\n\nAnd Fetterman - still four years away from another Senate campaign of his own - will put his message to the test this fall as an on-the-ground supporter for President Joe Biden in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state, and well beyond it too.\n\nBiden has also fielded backlash from the left over his support for Israel. To Donald Trump's delight, thousands of Democratic voters have staged \"uncommitted\" protest votes in presidential primaries across the country in the hopes of pushing the president to end American military aid to Israel, one of its most staunch foreign allies, before the general election in November.\n\nMore than 60,000 Pennsylvania voters chose the write-in option during the state's April primary, which had a lower-than-average 30% turnout. Biden won the state in 2022 by around 80,500 votes.\n\nBut Fetterman argues that Pennsylvania voters have largely been supportive of his stance on Israel, and they'll show up for Biden, too.\n\n\"I do believe that American people will be presented with that incredibly stark choice\" in November, he said, \"and I think they're going to make the right choice.\"\n\nThe Senate troll\n\nFetterman gained national attention during his 2022 Senate campaign in part because he was willing to be what few other high-profile politicians would be: a troll.\n\nHis campaign against Republican Mehmet Oz became flooded with memes as the Fetterman camp lampooned its celebrity doctor rival as an out-of-touch New Jersey transplant. They bought Cameos - personalized celebrity videos - of famous New Jerseyans like Snooki from \"Jersey Shore\" and Steve Van Zandt from \"The Sopranos\" and flew a plane down the coast calling him \"home\" to Jersey.\n\nIn one of the most viral gaffes of the campaign, Oz posted a video to social media complaining about the high price of assembling a platter of crudite\u0301s - or, as most Pennsylvanians would call it, a veggie tray. The jokes came rolling in.\n\nIt's a style that Fetterman's campaign staffers lovingly called \"ruthlessly authentic,\" according to one top aide speaking to the leftist podcast \"Know Your Enemy\" shortly after they won their race.\n\nBut in the months since Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking hundreds hostage, Fetterman has applied that same taunting tone to those protesting U.S. support for Israel's counter-attack.\n\nIn one viral exchange, he walked by waving an Israeli flag as pro-Palestinian protesters got arrested outside his Senate office building. He similarly greeted protesters outside his home with a giant Israeli flag. Last week, he called the protests on Columbia University's campus the \"pup tent intifada\" and mocked students after a Houthi-run university said it would take in American students suspended for supporting Palestine.\n\nIt's a transition that has left Fetterman's former left-leaning supporters reeling.\n\nLehigh University student Julie Wright recalled laughing about a crudite\u0301 sign in the eastern Pennsylvania campus cafeteria in 2022. It was a few months before her first opportunity to vote, an exciting moment.\n\n\"That just reminds me of my very early college days, bugging my friends about whether they registered to vote,\" Wright said.\n\nAt the time she was informally advocating for Fetterman and fellow Democrat Josh Shapiro, the gubernatorial nominee. Wright has since become president of Pennsylvania College Democrats.\n\n\"I look back very fondly on the passion I carried for those campaigns,\" she said.\n\nNow, however, Wright said she and some of her fellow young Democrats barely recognize Fetterman. She feels there's a disconnect between Fetterman the candidate and Fetterman the senator.\n\n\"I think one really big thing that I've seen is that (people feel) he's not actually a progressive,\" Wright said. \"That's what was pushed during his campaign. And people are talking a lot about holding candidates accountable.\"\n\nLeadership at Our Revolution - a progressive nonprofit that contacted hundreds of thousands of Sanders and Elizabeth Warren supporters to urge them to vote for Fetterman - is already second-guessing their endorsement.\n\nThe group's executive director, Joseph Geevarghese, told USA TODAY that Fetterman \"checked off every single progressive priority that we cared about.\"\n\nBut \"once he's been in power ... it doesn't seem as if we're aligned,\" Geevarghese said. In 2022, he noted, Our Revolution's candidate questionnaire focused on issues such as climate, jobs and health care. He said he believes the Israel-Hamas war will be a primary topic on the questionnaire moving forward.\n\n\"He is taking positions, for example, on Gaza, on immigration, that really don't reflect the candidate that we thought he was,\" Geevarghese said. \"And that's disconcerting.\"\n\nA few of Fetterman's staff also left in rapid succession earlier this year for other progressive offices off Capitol Hill. He pushed back on media coverage that suggested their departure was a reaction to his views on Israel, saying \"it's not unusual\" for staff to leave for other opportunities.\n\nAsked whether he considered himself a progressive during his 2022 Senate campaign, Fetterman plainly responded: \"No. I've been saying this again and again.\"\n\nFetterman said he's \"grateful\" to \"anyone who chose me over some weirdo from New Jersey.\" He added that his previous voters don't need to agree with him on everything, \"but you can count on me to be consistent on the things that I campaigned on,\" from LGBTQ rights to infrastructure investments.\n\n\"I would tell any progressives that worked for me: Look at my votes,\" the senator said.\n\n'Why don't they have our back?'\n\nIt's hard to miss the moment you step into Fetterman's Senate office: Walls plastered floor to ceiling with the faces of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nStanding in front of those posters, he speculated that his may be the only Senate office that has both a LGBTQ pride flag and a National League of Families POW/MIA flag - an indicator, he suggested, that you can \"absolutely\" represent multiple important issues that don't fall neatly along political lines.\n\n\"It's a false choice,\" he said.\n\nFetterman still lives in Braddock, the steel town near Pittsburgh where he served as the mayor for 13 years. It's a short drive from the Tree of Life synagogue, which was the site of an antisemitic mass shooting in 2018.\n\nHe recalled feeling horrified when he heard about it. He immediately called Jeff Bartos, then his GOP opponent in the race that year for lieutenant governor, who is Jewish, to check in on him. He paused his campaign for two days to join vigils with the local Jewish community.\n\n\"That certainly drove home that antisemitism is deadly and it's a real thing. And now they have the trauma of Oct. 7,\" he said.\n\n\"That's one of the reasons why I've done what's going on in our front office,\" Fetterman said. \"And now it must be incredibly unnerving and terrifying if you are a Jewish student, when you have all of these things. I'm sure they might feel like - why don't they have our back?\"\n\nFetterman suffered a stroke during his 2022 Senate campaign, which left him with an auditory processing disorder that makes it challenging to speak fluidly or quickly decipher spoken words. He uses a speech-to-text software that provides closed captioning in real time for media interviews and for conversations with staff and fellow senators.\n\nHe says he's always been committed to the issues he cares about. But the stroke - and a battle with clinical depression for which he sought inpatient treatment - further put things in perspective.\n\n\"It's undeniable. It's like that line from the first 'Batman' - I've been dead once already,\" he said. \"It's been very liberating in a sense, it allows me to focus on what really matters, and that's my family and making a contribution.\"\n\nFetterman's critics ask where that empathy is for the people of Gaza, where more than half of the population is experiencing catastrophic hunger and at least 13,000 children have been killed.\n\nThe senator responded that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is \"worse than horrible, it's heartbreaking.\"\n\nBut he pinned the blame on Hamas, which he says is the only party with the power to bring the war to an end by taking the current cease-fire deal on the table, surrendering and returning the hostages.\n\nHamas accepted a cease-fire deal on Monday that was negotiated in Egypt without Israeli involvement. Israel plans to send negotiators to discuss an agreement they would be willing to sign. In the meantime, Israel began preparing to launch an offensive in the southern city of Rafah, which the Biden administration has urged them not to do.\n\n\"They started this,\" Fetterman said of Hamas. \"They have designed this to maximize the kinds of destruction and death. They hide behind places like hospitals and civilians and schools and refugee camps. That's how it's been designed.\"\n\n\"We need more people in this institution that are willing to speak directly to hard things,\" Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., told USA TODAY. The pair, who entered Congress at the same time and are both raising school-aged children, struck up a friendship at orientation. \"I'm grateful for his leadership and his willingness to be bold. We need that right now.\"\n\nHe's also been embraced by some Jewish groups in Pennsylvania, which have found his stance a source of elation in recent months.\n\nJeff Finkelstein is president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh, a nonprofit serving the local Jewish community. He remembered seeing Fetterman at a federation gathering as mayor of Braddock several years ago and more recently at a vigil for Oct. 7 attack hostages held weekly in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood. He also recalled Fetterman's presence at a federation event in Washington, D.C. in March of this year.\n\n\"When Senator Fetterman came into the room, you would think a rockstar was greeting us,\" Finkelstein said.\n\nFinkelstein said he doesn't believe Fetterman's position conflicts with the senator's liberal tendencies, calling Israel a bastion of democracy and noting its support for LGBTQ rights.\n\n\"People can have really strong, progressive stances and support Israel,\" Finkelstein said. \"It's not, 'This or that.' It's, 'This and that.'\"\n\n\"I think most of us in the Jewish community are so pleased with his stance in understanding the difference between right and wrong, between terror and a civil society,\" he added.\n\nSwing state campaigning ahead\n\nLike Fetterman, Biden has been fielding fierce opposition from young, progressive voters over his handling of the Israel-Hamas war, during which he has largely shown steadfast support for Israel.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey from February found 36% of voters under 30 thought Biden was unduly favoring the Israelis, more than any other age group. The Harvard Youth Poll, conducted in March, found 51% of voters under 30 supported a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and more respondents thought Israel's response to Hamas' attack was unjustified than justified.\n\nIt's unclear whether that distaste will translate to enough Democratic base voters abandoning Biden in November to cost him the state. Recent polls show the presidential race will likely be tight.\n\nOne poll from Quinnipiac University found that around a quarter of voters said they view Fetterman more favorably since he began expressing strong support for Israel. Fourteen percent said it made them think less favorably of him.\n\nFetterman has criticized Biden for not going far enough to stand with Israel. In one instance in April, he told CNN that he would never \"capitulate to the fringe\" as Biden has by urging Israel not to directly respond to an attack from Iran.\n\nBut the senator told USA TODAY that while they sometimes disagree, Biden is \"an awesome president, and I'm all in on him.\"\n\nFetterman has already been on the campaign trail stumping for Biden - including appearing in Orlando over the weekend to speak at the Florida Democratic Party's fundraiser on behalf of Biden, despite efforts from the party's Progressive Caucus to disinvite him for being \"a genocide promoter.\"\n\nA Biden campaign aide said that the president has support from Democrats across the political spectrum in Pennsylvania, including Fetterman, which they believe will work in Biden's favor.\n\nAnd other Democrats said in interviews that they thought Fetterman would still be an effective surrogate for Biden in the Keystone State.\n\nRep. Summer Lee, D-Penn., represents Fetterman's hometown in Congress. A member of the progressive \"squad,\" she has been a vocal critic of Israel's attacks on Gaza. Lee beat out a primary challenger last month that took her on over the issue.\n\nAsked what she thinks about Fetterman's approach to the topic, she said \"I would like to see people being a little bit more nuanced. There's a realm of disagreement that is possible without labeling everybody as Hamas or an extremist.\"\n\nBut she said Pennsylvania voters \"are going to take a holistic approach to votes.\"\n\n\"There's a disproportionate amount of attention that's being spent on this one topic, but I think that Pennsylvanians care about lots of things that they would love to get some attention or for people to maybe even provide some solutions for,\" she said\n\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., is the chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is responsible for getting Democratic senators elected, including Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., who will face a competitive general election in the commonwealth this fall.\n\nPeters said Fetterman \"is going to be who he is.\"\n\n\"He is an incredibly authentic U.S. senator, and people appreciate him for his authenticity,\" Peters said. \"I'm sure he will be effective at campaigning for his colleague (Casey) as well as for the president.\"\n\nFetterman, for one, isn't worried. His message to progressives who may abstain from the general election: \"Go ahead. And then when you get the second term of Trump, you've got to own that tragedy.\"\n\nHowever, he said he believes voters will turn out for Biden when they realize the stakes.\n\n\"I trust in democracy. If the voters turn their backside to the stove, that fire is going to burn,\" Fetterman said. \"It's really that kind of a choice right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news",

John Fetterman wants you to know about him, it's that he's the same guy he was on the campaign trail.\n\nThe junior Democratic senator from Pennsylvania still shows up to work each day in a Carhartt hoodie and gym shorts, peppers conversation with profanity and takes potshots at the \"losers\" and \"sleazeballs\" he feels need to be called out - and he won't mince words when it comes to Israel.\n\n\"I said I dress like a slob, I dress like a slob,\" he said. \"I said I was going to stand with Israel, I stand with Israel. I said I'm going to be a reliable Democratic vote, and I'm still a reliable Democratic vote.\"\n\nThat's not how many on the left see him lately.\n\nIn the months since the Israel-Hamas war began, Fetterman has become one of his party's most outspoken supporters of Israel.\n\nHe's on an island apart from his Democratic peers, most of whom have attempted to strike a balance between supporting Israel's interest in self defense while condemning the carnage that has come from its airstrikes and ground invasion on the Gaza Strip, which have killed more than 34,500 people and created dire humanitarian conditions for those who remain. He's also become a vocal critic of the pro-Palestine protests that have popped up on college campuses around the country in response.\n\nFetterman's position has come as a shock to progressives who championed him on the trail in 2022, when he became the only Democrat to flip a seat in the upper chamber. The campaign drew legions of left-leaning admirers who saw him as a populist rising star in line with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders - people who now call him a \"betrayal,\" a \"flip-flopper\" and a \"jagoff.\"\n\nIn an exclusive interview with USA TODAY last week, Fetterman argued those assumptions were wrong from the start, and that he signaled his \"unwavering\" support for Israel well before he was elected.\n\n\"I am not a progressive,\" he said. \"I've been saying that for years. I just don't identify with that label. But I'm still a Democrat and someone you can count on.\"\n\nFormer supporters, frustrated with his public rejection of the label, point to social media posts that suggest otherwise.\n\nAnd Fetterman - still four years away from another Senate campaign of his own - will put his message to the test this fall as an on-the-ground supporter for President Joe Biden in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state, and well beyond it too.\n\nBiden has also fielded backlash from the left over his support for Israel. To Donald Trump's delight, thousands of Democratic voters have staged \"uncommitted\" protest votes in presidential primaries across the country in the hopes of pushing the president to end American military aid to Israel, one of its most staunch foreign allies, before the general election in November.\n\nMore than 60,000 Pennsylvania voters chose the write-in option during the state's April primary, which had a lower-than-average 30% turnout. Biden won the state in 2022 by around 80,500 votes.\n\nBut Fetterman argues that Pennsylvania voters have largely been supportive of his stance on Israel, and they'll show up for Biden, too.\n\n\"I do believe that American people will be presented with that incredibly stark choice\" in November, he said, \"and I think they're going to make the right choice.\"\n\nThe Senate troll\n\nFetterman gained national attention during his 2022 Senate campaign in part because he was willing to be what few other high-profile politicians would be: a troll.\n\nHis campaign against Republican Mehmet Oz became flooded with memes as the Fetterman camp lampooned its celebrity doctor rival as an out-of-touch New Jersey transplant. They bought Cameos - personalized celebrity videos - of famous New Jerseyans like Snooki from \"Jersey Shore\" and Steve Van Zandt from \"The Sopranos\" and flew a plane down the coast calling him \"home\" to Jersey.\n\nIn one of the most viral gaffes of the campaign, Oz posted a video to social media complaining about the high price of assembling a platter of crudit\u00e9s - or, as most Pennsylvanians would call it, a veggie tray. The jokes came rolling in.\n\nIt's a style that Fetterman's campaign staffers lovingly called \"ruthlessly authentic,\" according to one top aide speaking to the leftist podcast \"Know Your Enemy\" shortly after they won their race.\n\nBut in the months since Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking hundreds hostage, Fetterman has applied that same taunting tone to those protesting U.S. support for Israel's counter-attack.\n\nIn one viral exchange, he walked by waving an Israeli flag as pro-Palestinian protesters got arrested outside his Senate office building. He similarly greeted protesters outside his home with a giant Israeli flag. Last week, he called the protests on Columbia University's campus the \"pup tent intifada\" and mocked students after a Houthi-run university said it would take in American students suspended for supporting Palestine.\n\nIt's a transition that has left Fetterman's former left-leaning supporters reeling.\n\nLehigh University student Julie Wright recalled laughing about a crudit\u00e9 sign in the eastern Pennsylvania campus cafeteria in 2022. It was a few months before her first opportunity to vote, an exciting moment.\n\n\"That just reminds me of my very early college days, bugging my friends about whether they registered to vote,\" Wright said.\n\nAt the time she was informally advocating for Fetterman and fellow Democrat Josh Shapiro, the gubernatorial nominee. Wright has since become president of Pennsylvania College Democrats.\n\n\"I look back very fondly on the passion I carried for those campaigns,\" she said.\n\nNow, however, Wright said she and some of her fellow young Democrats barely recognize Fetterman. She feels there's a disconnect between Fetterman the candidate and Fetterman the senator.\n\n\"I think one really big thing that I've seen is that (people feel) he's not actually a progressive,\" Wright said. \"That's what was pushed during his campaign. And people are talking a lot about holding candidates accountable.\"\n\nLeadership at Our Revolution - a progressive nonprofit that contacted hundreds of thousands of Sanders and Elizabeth Warren supporters to urge them to vote for Fetterman - is already second-guessing their endorsement.\n\nThe group's executive director, Joseph Geevarghese, told USA TODAY that Fetterman \"checked off every single progressive priority that we cared about.\"\n\nBut \"once he's been in power ... it doesn't seem as if we're aligned,\" Geevarghese said. In 2022, he noted, Our Revolution's candidate questionnaire focused on issues such as climate, jobs and health care. He said he believes the Israel-Hamas war will be a primary topic on the questionnaire moving forward.\n\n\"He is taking positions, for example, on Gaza, on immigration, that really don't reflect the candidate that we thought he was,\" Geevarghese said. \"And that's disconcerting.\"\n\nA few of Fetterman's staff also left in rapid succession earlier this year for other progressive offices off Capitol Hill. He pushed back on media coverage that suggested their departure was a reaction to his views on Israel, saying \"it's not unusual\" for staff to leave for other opportunities.\n\nAsked whether he considered himself a progressive during his 2022 Senate campaign, Fetterman plainly responded: \"No. I've been saying this again and again.\"\n\nFetterman said he's \"grateful\" to \"anyone who chose me over some weirdo from New Jersey.\" He added that his previous voters don't need to agree with him on everything, \"but you can count on me to be consistent on the things that I campaigned on,\" from LGBTQ rights to infrastructure investments.\n\n\"I would tell any progressives that worked for me: Look at my votes,\" the senator said.\n\n'Why don't they have our back?'\n\nIt's hard to miss the moment you step into Fetterman's Senate office: Walls plastered floor to ceiling with the faces of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nStanding in front of those posters, he speculated that his may be the only Senate office that has both a LGBTQ pride flag and a National League of Families POW/MIA flag - an indicator, he suggested, that you can \"absolutely\" represent multiple important issues that don't fall neatly along political lines.\n\n\"It's a false choice,\" he said.\n\nFetterman still lives in Braddock, the steel town near Pittsburgh where he served as the mayor for 13 years. It's a short drive from the Tree of Life synagogue, which was the site of an antisemitic mass shooting in 2018.\n\nHe recalled feeling horrified when he heard about it. He immediately called Jeff Bartos, then his GOP opponent in the race that year for lieutenant governor, who is Jewish, to check in on him. He paused his campaign for two days to join vigils with the local Jewish community.\n\n\"That certainly drove home that antisemitism is deadly and it's a real thing. And now they have the trauma of Oct. 7,\" he said.\n\n\"That's one of the reasons why I've done what's going on in our front office,\" Fetterman said. \"And now it must be incredibly unnerving and terrifying if you are a Jewish student, when you have all of these things. I'm sure they might feel like - why don't they have our back?\"\n\nFetterman suffered a stroke during his 2022 Senate campaign, which left him with an auditory processing disorder that makes it challenging to speak fluidly or quickly decipher spoken words. He uses a speech-to-text software that provides closed captioning in real time for media interviews and for conversations with staff and fellow senators.\n\nHe says he's always been committed to the issues he cares about. But the stroke - and a battle with clinical depression for which he sought inpatient treatment - further put things in perspective.\n\n\"It's undeniable. It's like that line from the first 'Batman' - I've been dead once already,\" he said. \"It's been very liberating in a sense, it allows me to focus on what really matters, and that's my family and making a contribution.\"\n\nFetterman's critics ask where that empathy is for the people of Gaza, where more than half of the population is experiencing catastrophic hunger and at least 13,000 children have been killed.\n\nThe senator responded that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is \"worse than horrible, it's heartbreaking.\"\n\nBut he pinned the blame on Hamas, which he says is the only party with the power to bring the war to an end by taking the current cease-fire deal on the table, surrendering and returning the hostages.\n\nHamas accepted a cease-fire deal on Monday that was negotiated in Egypt without Israeli involvement. Israel plans to send negotiators to discuss an agreement they would be willing to sign. In the meantime, Israel began preparing to launch an offensive in the southern city of Rafah, which the Biden administration has urged them not to do.\n\n\"They started this,\" Fetterman said of Hamas. \"They have designed this to maximize the kinds of destruction and death. They hide behind places like hospitals and civilians and schools and refugee camps. That's how it's been designed.\"\n\n'You would think a rockstar was greeting us'\n\nFetterman's outspoken support for Israel has drawn praise and even some financial support from Republicans, which he has embraced.\n\n\"We need more people in this institution that are willing to speak directly to hard things,\" Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., told USA TODAY. The pair, who entered Congress at the same time and are both raising school-aged children, struck up a friendship at orientation. \"I'm grateful for his leadership and his willingness to be bold. We need that right now.\"\n\nHe's also been embraced by some Jewish groups in Pennsylvania, which have found his stance a source of elation in recent months.\n\nJeff Finkelstein is president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh, a nonprofit serving the local Jewish community. He remembered seeing Fetterman at a federation gathering as mayor of Braddock several years ago and more recently at a vigil for Oct. 7 attack hostages held weekly in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood. He also recalled Fetterman's presence at a federation event in Washington, D.C. in March of this year.\n\n\"When Senator Fetterman came into the room, you would think a rockstar was greeting us,\" Finkelstein said.\n\nFinkelstein said he doesn't believe Fetterman's position conflicts with the senator's liberal tendencies, calling Israel a bastion of democracy and noting its support for LGBTQ rights.\n\n\"People can have really strong, progressive stances and support Israel,\" Finkelstein said. \"It's not, 'This or that.' It's, 'This and that.'\"\n\n\"I think most of us in the Jewish community are so pleased with his stance in understanding the difference between right and wrong, between terror and a civil society,\" he added.\n\nSwing state campaigning ahead\n\nLike Fetterman, Biden has been fielding fierce opposition from young, progressive voters over his handling of the Israel-Hamas war, during which he has largely shown steadfast support for Israel.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey from February found 36% of voters under 30 thought Biden was unduly favoring the Israelis, more than any other age group. The Harvard Youth Poll, conducted in March, found 51% of voters under 30 supported a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and more respondents thought Israel's response to Hamas' attack was unjustified than justified.\n\nIt's unclear whether that distaste will translate to enough Democratic base voters abandoning Biden in November to cost him the state. Recent polls show the presidential race will likely be tight.\n\nOne poll from Quinnipiac University found that around a quarter of voters said they view Fetterman more favorably since he began expressing strong support for Israel. Fourteen percent said it made them think less favorably of him.\n\nFetterman has criticized Biden for not going far enough to stand with Israel. In one instance in April, he told CNN that he would never \"capitulate to the fringe\" as Biden has by urging Israel not to directly respond to an attack from Iran.\n\nBut the senator told USA TODAY that while they sometimes disagree, Biden is \"an awesome president, and I'm all in on him.\"\n\nFetterman has already been on the campaign trail stumping for Biden - including appearing in Orlando over the weekend to speak at the Florida Democratic Party's fundraiser on behalf of Biden, despite efforts from the party's Progressive Caucus to disinvite him for being \"a genocide promoter.\"\n\nA Biden campaign aide said that the president has support from Democrats across the political spectrum in Pennsylvania, including Fetterman, which they believe will work in Biden's favor.\n\nAnd other Democrats said in interviews that they thought Fetterman would still be an effective surrogate for Biden in the Keystone State.\n\nRep. Summer Lee, D-Penn., represents Fetterman's hometown in Congress. A member of the progressive \"squad,\" she has been a vocal critic of Israel's attacks on Gaza. Lee beat out a primary challenger last month that took her on over the issue.\n\nAsked what she thinks about Fetterman's approach to the topic, she said \"I would like to see people being a little bit more nuanced. There's a realm of disagreement that is possible without labeling everybody as Hamas or an extremist.\"\n\nBut she said Pennsylvania voters \"are going to take a holistic approach to votes.\"\n\n\"There's a disproportionate amount of attention that's being spent on this one topic, but I think that Pennsylvanians care about lots of things that they would love to get some attention or for people to maybe even provide some solutions for,\" she said\n\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., is the chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is responsible for getting Democratic senators elected, including Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., who will face a competitive general election in the commonwealth this fall.\n\nPeters said Fetterman \"is going to be who he is.\"\n\n\"He is an incredibly authentic U.S. senator, and people appreciate him for his authenticity,\" Peters said. \"I'm sure he will be effective at campaigning for his colleague (Casey) as well as for the president.\"\n\nFetterman, for one, isn't worried. His message to progressives who may abstain from the general election: \"Go ahead. And then when you get the second term of Trump, you've got to own that tragedy.\"\n\nHowever, he said he believes voters will turn out for Biden when they realize the stakes.\n\n\"I trust in democracy. If the voters turn their backside to the stove, that fire is going to burn,\" Fetterman said. \"It's really that kind of a choice right now.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Why

Israel is in this kind of a war, and we, I have no conditions, I never have, and I can't imagine I ever will.\"\n\nFetterman went on to say: \"If there should be any kind of conditions, it should be on Hamas and its [enablers] and its benefactors.\" That comment was mocked on social media since the U.S. doesn't provide military assistance to Hamas.\n\nBefore anyone to the political right of Upton Sinclair gets too excited about John Fetterman's prospective red-pilling, it's important to note that he has repeatedly stated his support for the Biden administration in virtually every other area.\n\nFetterman spokesperson Carrie Adams told Newsweek that Fetterman has been \"very clear that he fully supports President Biden -- he's in fact wearing a Florida Democratic Party hoodie in that interview -- he got it over the weekend where he rallied Florida Democrats in support of the president.\"\n\nShe said his \"main message was that we can disagree on some politics and policy in this big tent party, but we can't disagree on who to vote for in the fall, that we've got to support Biden.\"\n\nOn the topic of Israel and the pro-Hamas protestors in the United States, however, Senator Fetterman has a more realistic output than many others in his party.\n\nPreviously on RedState: John Fetterman Pulverizes Anti-Israel Protesters 'Living in a Pup Tent for Hamas'\n\nJohn Fetterman 2.0 Is All of Us in Describing Pro-Hamas Bridge, Road Blockers\n\nCredit where credit is due: Senator Fetterman has been unwavering in his support for Israel, and has done some benchmark trolling of pro-Hamas activists, including walking past protestors waving a small Israeli flag.\n\nRegardless of his support for the administration on other issues, the Biden administration has earned Senator Fetterman's disagreement on this issue, as their support for Israel has been tepid at best, and the administration is working against itself in providing food and medical support to Hamas during the conflict; the supplies are supposedly for humanitarian purposes, but video evidence reveals that Hamas fighters have been hijacking the shipments.\n\nThe relevant portion of the interview appeared on X/Twitter, in which the senator also calls on Hamas to end the fighting by handing over all of the remaining hostages and surrendering:\n\nIt's something of a relief to know that, at least one Democrat, on one issue, is applying a little common sense.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ward_clark@redstate.com", "name": "Ward Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fetterman_(reporter)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Fetterman (reporter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Upton Sinclair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RedState", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RedState"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_tent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big tent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/109/42aa5494-9172-4bab-a1ae-e4163ff1bfbb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549129", "eventUri": "eng-9549129", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

In the months since, the U.S. had accelerated the transfer of weapons to its ally even as Israel's offensive in Gaza has left much of it in ruins and more than 34,000 Palestinians killed, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIn an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday, Fetterman, a Democrat who is a vocal supporter of Israel's actions in Gaza, said he doesn't agree that the U.S. should withhold arms from Israel or impose any conditions on its ally.\n\nBiden has been \"very supportive about Israel, but I don't agree with him on everything,\" Fetterman said. \"Like for example, I was public and I said that I don't think we should be withholding any kind of munitions and I think, I said, I think we need to send them immediately...

I mean, they would know the situation more than I do.\"\n\nFetterman and the White House have been contacted for comment via email.\n\nFetterman's decision to appear on a conservative network to criticize Biden comes after he slammed other Democrats for publicly criticizing the president in February, saying it would help Donald Trump in November's election. Those remarks came after Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, urged voters to withhold support for Biden in her state's primary election over his response to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\n\"If you're not willing to just support the president now, and say these kinds of things, you might as well just get your MAGA hat because you now are helping Trump with this,\" Fetterman said at the time.\n\nFetterman's unwavering support for Israel has shocked some who previously supported him and set him apart from his Democrat colleagues, many of whom have sought to strike a balance between supporting Israel and condemning the rising Palestinian death toll in Gaza.\n\nHe has also criticized the pro-Palestinian protests that have rocked college campuses across the country in recent weeks. Demonstrators have been calling on universities to cut financial ties with Israel and divest from companies profiting from the war in Gaza.\n\nThe protests could pose a challenge to Biden's reelection effort, as polling has shown that many young voters are critical of the president's Israel policy.\n\nBut despite the strain on Biden's relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel's move to invade Rafah, Biden on Tuesday said his support for Israel is \"ironclad even when we disagree.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said \"two things can be true at once\" when asked to square the U.S.'s expressions of support for the safety of Palestinian civilians in Gaza with the ongoing provision of arms to Israel.\n\n\"Israel has a right, and a responsibility to defend itself, and we're going to continue to provide for their security and help them with that,\" she said on Monday. \"And at the same time, they have a right and obligation to be careful about civilian casualties and getting more humanitarian assistance in.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "khaleda_rahman@newsweek.com", "name":

John Fetterman wants you to know about him, it's that he's the same guy he was on the campaign trail.\n\nThe junior Democratic senator from Pennsylvania still shows up to work each day in a Carhartt hoodie and gym shorts, peppers conversation with profanity and takes potshots at the \"losers\" and \"sleazeballs\" he feels need to be called out - and he won't mince words when it comes to Israel.\n\n\"I said I dress like a slob, I dress like a slob,\" he said. \"I said I was going to stand with Israel, I stand with Israel. I said I'm going to be a reliable Democratic vote, and I'm still a reliable Democratic vote.\"\n\nThat's not how many on the left see him lately.\n\nIn the months since the Israel-Hamas war began, Fetterman has become one of his party's most outspoken supporters of Israel.\n\nHe's on an island apart from his Democratic peers, most of whom have attempted to strike a balance between supporting Israel's interest in self defense while condemning the carnage that has come from its airstrikes and ground invasion on the Gaza Strip, which have killed more than 34,500 people and created dire humanitarian conditions for those who remain. He's also become a vocal critic of the pro-Palestine protests that have popped up on college campuses around the country in response.\n\nFetterman's position has come as a shock to progressives who championed him on the trail in 2022, when he became the only Democrat to flip a seat in the upper chamber. The campaign drew legions of left-leaning admirers who saw him as a populist rising star in line with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders - people who now call him a \"betrayal,\" a \"flip-flopper\" and a \"jagoff.\"\n\nIn an exclusive interview with USA TODAY last week, Fetterman argued those assumptions were wrong from the start, and that he signaled his \"unwavering\" support for Israel well before he was elected.\n\n\"I am not a progressive,\" he said. \"I've been saying that for years. I just don't identify with that label. But I'm still a Democrat and someone you can count on.\"\n\nFormer supporters, frustrated with his public rejection of the label, point to social media posts that suggest otherwise.\n\nAnd Fetterman - still four years away from another Senate campaign of his own - will put his message to the test this fall as an on-the-ground supporter for President Joe Biden in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state, and well beyond it too.\n\nBiden has also fielded backlash from the left over his support for Israel. To Donald Trump's delight, thousands of Democratic voters have staged \"uncommitted\" protest votes in presidential primaries across the country in the hopes of pushing the president to end American military aid to Israel, one of its most staunch foreign allies, before the general election in November.\n\nMore than 60,000 Pennsylvania voters chose the write-in option during the state's April primary, which had a lower-than-average 30% turnout. Biden won the state in 2022 by around 80,500 votes.\n\nBut Fetterman argues that Pennsylvania voters have largely been supportive of his stance on Israel, and they'll show up for Biden, too.\n\n\"I do believe that American people will be presented with that incredibly stark choice\" in November, he said, \"and I think they're going to make the right choice.\"\n\nFetterman gained national attention during his 2022 Senate campaign in part because he was willing to be what few other high-profile politicians would be: a troll.\n\nHis campaign against Republican Mehmet Oz became flooded with memes as the Fetterman camp lampooned its celebrity doctor rival as an out-of-touch New Jersey transplant. They bought Cameos - personalized celebrity videos - of famous New Jerseyans like Snooki from \"Jersey Shore\" and Steve Van Zandt from \"The Sopranos\" and flew a plane down the coast calling him \"home\" to Jersey.\n\nIn one of the most viral gaffes of the campaign, Oz posted a video to social media complaining about the high price of assembling a platter of crudit\u00e9s - or, as most Pennsylvanians would call it, a veggie tray. The jokes came rolling in.\n\nIt's a style that Fetterman's campaign staffers lovingly called \"ruthlessly authentic,\" according to one top aide speaking to the leftist podcast \"Know Your Enemy\" shortly after they won their race.\n\nBut in the months since Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking hundreds hostage, Fetterman has applied that same taunting tone to those protesting U.S. support for Israel's counter-attack.\n\nIn one viral exchange, he walked by waving an Israeli flag as pro-Palestinian protesters got arrested outside his Senate office building. He similarly greeted protesters outside his home with a giant Israeli flag. Last week, he called the protests on Columbia University's campus the \"pup tent intifada\" and mocked students after a Houthi-run university said it would take in American students suspended for supporting Palestine.\n\nIt's a transition that has left Fetterman's former left-leaning supporters reeling.\n\nLehigh University student Julie Wright recalled laughing about a crudit\u00e9 sign in the eastern Pennsylvania campus cafeteria in 2022. It was a few months before her first opportunity to vote, an exciting moment.\n\n\"That just reminds me of my very early college days, bugging my friends about whether they registered to vote,\" Wright said.\n\nAt the time she was informally advocating for Fetterman and fellow Democrat Josh Shapiro, the gubernatorial nominee. Wright has since become president of Pennsylvania College Democrats.\n\n\"I look back very fondly on the passion I carried for those campaigns,\" she said.\n\nNow, however, Wright said she and some of her fellow young Democrats barely recognize Fetterman. She feels there's a disconnect between Fetterman the candidate and Fetterman the senator.\n\n\"I think one really big thing that I've seen is that (people feel) he's not actually a progressive,\" Wright said. \"That's what was pushed during his campaign. And people are talking a lot about holding candidates accountable.\"\n\nLeadership at Our Revolution - a progressive nonprofit that contacted hundreds of thousands of Sanders and Elizabeth Warren supporters to urge them to vote for Fetterman - is already second-guessing their endorsement.\n\nThe group's executive director, Joseph Geevarghese, told USA TODAY that Fetterman \"checked off every single progressive priority that we cared about.\"\n\nBut \"once he's been in power ... it doesn't seem as if we're aligned,\" Geevarghese said. In 2022, he noted, Our Revolution's candidate questionnaire focused on issues such as climate, jobs and health care. He said he believes the Israel-Hamas war will be a primary topic on the questionnaire moving forward.\n\n\"He is taking positions, for example, on Gaza, on immigration, that really don't reflect the candidate that we thought he was,\" Geevarghese said. \"And that's disconcerting.\"\n\nA few of Fetterman's staff also left in rapid succession earlier this year for other progressive offices off Capitol Hill. He pushed back on media coverage that suggested their departure was a reaction to his views on Israel, saying \"it's not unusual\" for staff to leave for other opportunities.\n\nAsked whether he considered himself a progressive during his 2022 Senate campaign, Fetterman plainly responded: \"No. I've been saying this again and again.\"\n\nFetterman said he's \"grateful\" to \"anyone who chose me over some weirdo from New Jersey.\" He added that his previous voters don't need to agree with him on everything, \"but you can count on me to be consistent on the things that I campaigned on,\" from LGBTQ rights to infrastructure investments.\n\n\"I would tell any progressives that worked for me: Look at my votes,\" the senator said.\n\nIt's hard to miss the moment you step into Fetterman's Senate office: Walls plastered floor to ceiling with the faces of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nStanding in front of those posters, he speculated that his may be the only Senate office that has both a LGBTQ pride flag and a National League of Families POW/MIA flag - an indicator, he suggested, that you can \"absolutely\" represent multiple important issues that don't fall neatly along political lines.\n\n\"It's a false choice,\" he said.\n\nFetterman still lives in Braddock, the steel town near Pittsburgh where he served as the mayor for 13 years. It's a short drive from the Tree of Life synagogue, which was the site of an antisemitic mass shooting in 2018.\n\nHe recalled feeling horrified when he heard about it. He immediately called Jeff Bartos, then his GOP opponent in the race that year for lieutenant governor, who is Jewish, to check in on him. He paused his campaign for two days to join vigils with the local Jewish community.\n\n\"That certainly drove home that antisemitism is deadly and it's a real thing. And now they have the trauma of Oct. 7,\" he said.\n\n\"That's one of the reasons why I've done what's going on in our front office,\" Fetterman said. \"And now it must be incredibly unnerving and terrifying if you are a Jewish student, when you have all of these things. I'm sure they might feel like - why don't they have our back?\"\n\nFetterman suffered a stroke during his 2022 Senate campaign, which left him with an auditory processing disorder that makes it challenging to speak fluidly or quickly decipher spoken words. He uses a speech-to-text software that provides closed captioning in real time for media interviews and for conversations with staff and fellow senators.\n\nHe says he's always been committed to the issues he cares about. But the stroke - and a battle with clinical depression for which he sought inpatient treatment - further put things in perspective.\n\n\"It's undeniable. It's like that line from the first 'Batman' - I've been dead once already,\" he said. \"It's been very liberating in a sense, it allows me to focus on what really matters, and that's my family and making a contribution.\"\n\nFetterman's critics ask where that empathy is for the people of Gaza, where more than half of the population is experiencing catastrophic hunger and at least 13,000 children have been killed.\n\nThe senator responded that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is \"worse than horrible, it's heartbreaking.\"\n\nBut he pinned the blame on Hamas, which he says is the only party with the power to bring the war to an end by taking the current cease-fire deal on the table, surrendering and returning the hostages.\n\nHamas accepted a cease-fire deal on Monday that was negotiated in Egypt without Israeli involvement. Israel plans to send negotiators to discuss an agreement they would be willing to sign. In the meantime, Israel began preparing to launch an offensive in the southern city of Rafah, which the Biden administration has urged them not to do.\n\n\"They started this,\" Fetterman said of Hamas. \"They have designed this to maximize the kinds of destruction and death. They hide behind places like hospitals and civilians and schools and refugee camps. That's how it's been designed.\"\n\nFetterman's outspoken support for Israel has drawn praise and even some financial support from Republicans, which he has embraced.\n\n\"We need more people in this institution that are willing to speak directly to hard things,\" Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., told USA TODAY. The pair, who entered Congress at the same time and are both raising school-aged children, struck up a friendship at orientation. \"I'm grateful for his leadership and his willingness to be bold. We need that right now.\"\n\nHe's also been embraced by some Jewish groups in Pennsylvania, which have found his stance a source of elation in recent months.\n\nJeff Finkelstein is president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh, a nonprofit serving the local Jewish community. He remembered seeing Fetterman at a federation gathering as mayor of Braddock several years ago and more recently at a vigil for Oct. 7 attack hostages held weekly in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood. He also recalled Fetterman's presence at a federation event in Washington, D.C. in March of this year.\n\n\"When Senator Fetterman came into the room, you would think a rockstar was greeting us,\" Finkelstein said.\n\nFinkelstein said he doesn't believe Fetterman's position conflicts with the senator's liberal tendencies, calling Israel a bastion of democracy and noting its support for LGBTQ rights.\n\n\"People can have really strong, progressive stances and support Israel,\" Finkelstein said. \"It's not, 'This or that.' It's, 'This and that.'\"\n\n\"I think most of us in the Jewish community are so pleased with his stance in understanding the difference between right and wrong, between terror and a civil society,\" he added.\n\nLike Fetterman, Biden has been fielding fierce opposition from young, progressive voters over his handling of the Israel-Hamas war, during which he has largely shown steadfast support for Israel.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey from February found 36% of voters under 30 thought Biden was unduly favoring the Israelis, more than any other age group. The Harvard Youth Poll, conducted in March, found 51% of voters under 30 supported a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and more respondents thought Israel's response to Hamas' attack was unjustified than justified.\n\nIt's unclear whether that distaste will translate to enough Democratic base voters abandoning Biden in November to cost him the state. Recent polls show the presidential race will likely be tight.\n\nOne poll from Quinnipiac University found that around a quarter of voters said they view Fetterman more favorably since he began expressing strong support for Israel. Fourteen percent said it made them think less favorably of him.\n\nFetterman has criticized Biden for not going far enough to stand with Israel. In one instance in April, he told CNN that he would never \"capitulate to the fringe\" as Biden has by urging Israel not to directly respond to an attack from Iran.\n\nBut the senator told USA TODAY that while they sometimes disagree, Biden is \"an awesome president, and I'm all in on him.\"\n\nFetterman has already been on the campaign trail stumping for Biden - including appearing in Orlando over the weekend to speak at the Florida Democratic Party's fundraiser on behalf of Biden, despite efforts from the party's Progressive Caucus to disinvite him for being \"a genocide promoter.\"\n\nA Biden campaign aide said that the president has support from Democrats across the political spectrum in Pennsylvania, including Fetterman, which they believe will work in Biden's favor.\n\nAnd other Democrats said in interviews that they thought Fetterman would still be an effective surrogate for Biden in the Keystone State.\n\nRep. Summer Lee, D-Penn., represents Fetterman's hometown in Congress. A member of the progressive \"squad,\" she has been a vocal critic of Israel's attacks on Gaza. Lee beat out a primary challenger last month that took her on over the issue.\n\nAsked what she thinks about Fetterman's approach to the topic, she said \"I would like to see people being a little bit more nuanced. There's a realm of disagreement that is possible without labeling everybody as Hamas or an extremist.\"\n\nBut she said Pennsylvania voters \"are going to take a holistic approach to votes.\"\n\n\"There's a disproportionate amount of attention that's being spent on this one topic, but I think that Pennsylvanians care about lots of things that they would love to get some attention or for people to maybe even provide some solutions for,\" she said\n\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., is the chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is responsible for getting Democratic senators elected, including Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., who will face a competitive general election in the commonwealth this fall.\n\nPeters said Fetterman \"is going to be who he is.\"\n\n\"He is an incredibly authentic U.S. senator, and people appreciate him for his authenticity,\" Peters said. \"I'm sure he will be effective at campaigning for his colleague (Casey) as well as for the president.\"\n\nFetterman, for one, isn't worried. His message to progressives who may abstain from the general election: \"Go ahead. And then when you get the second term of Trump, you've got to own that tragedy.\"\n\nHowever, he said he believes voters will turn out for Biden when they realize the stakes.\n\n\"I trust in democracy. If the voters turn their backside to the stove, that fire is going to burn,\" Fetterman said. \"It's really that kind of a choice right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType":

Fetterman demanded an immediate reversal.\n\n\"I strongly disagree with this decision and it should be immediately reversed,\" he said.\n\nThe senator continued by noting such restrictions \"should be on Hamas, its enablers, and benefactors\" instead of the U.S. ally.\n\nSen. Fetterman has been a vocal ally of Israel during its war against Hamas, a stance not shared by some of his more progressive colleagues in the Democratic Party. The senator last week cautioned U.S. student protesters against accepting an offer from a terrorist group to continue their studies in the Middle East.\n\nREAD MORE | GOP senator says Fetterman proves how 'radical' Dems have become on Israel: 'Nuts'\n\n\"If a homicidal, Iranian-funded, terrorism proxy wants to pick up your college education tab, you really, really might want to reevaluate things,\" he said via X.\n\nThe senator last month expressed disbelief after some House Democrats voted against a resolution condemning an Iranian missile attack on Israel.\n\n\"I sincerely thought I'd never witness members of my party refuse to condemn Iran -- one of the world's leading terrorism sponsors -- after launching hundreds of drones against our special ally, Israel,\" Sen. Fetterman said at the time. \"No words.\"", "source": {"uri": "wsbt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WSBT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackson_walker@wsbt.com", "name": "Jackson Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://wsbt.com/resources/media/c47bc658-5561-451a-8222-d0f54d1f2e2f-large16x9_GettyImages1251924069.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549129", "eventUri": "eng-9549129", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

In the months since the Israel-Hamas war began, John Fetterman, the junior Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, has become one of his party's most outspoken supporters of Israel.\n\nHe's on an island apart from his Democratic peers, most of whom have attempted to strike a balance between supporting Israel's interest in self defense while condemning the carnage that has come from its airstrikes and ground invasion on the Gaza Strip, the USA TODAY Network's Riley Beggin and Bruce Siwy reported. He's also become a vocal critic of the pro-Palestine protests that have popped up on college campuses around the country.\n\n\u2753Who is Fetterman? Fetterman gained national attention during his 2022 Senate campaign in part because he was willing to be what few other high-profile politicians would be: A troll.

They hide behind places like hospitals and civilians and schools and refugee camps. That's how it's been designed.\"\n\nThe Pennsylvania Democrat was responding to criticism accusing him of lacking empathy for the people of Gaza, where more than 34,700 Palestinians have died since early October, according to local health officials.\n\nHis comments come days after Hamas said it accepted a temporary cease-fire deal that would pause fighting in Gaza and secure the release of the remaining Israeli hostages being held in Gaza. Israel said the group's terms fell short of its core demands.\n\nFetterman, who is serving his first term in the Senate, has been a steadfast supporter of Israel since Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks, often breaking with liberal Democrats over Israel's handling of the war.\n\nSpeaking with USA Today, Fetterman continued his criticism of the pro-Palestinian protests at colleges across the country, pointing to fears from Jewish students.\n\n\"And now it must be incredibly unnerving and terrifying if you are a Jewish student, when you have all of these things,\" he said. \"I'm sure they might feel like - why don't they have our back?\"\n\nMany of the demonstrations have been reported to be peaceful, though school administrators said they have received concerns over the safety of Jewish students and the potential for antisemitic rhetoric.\n\nHis remarks were published a day after Israeli forces seized control of the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza, where more than 1 million civilians are seeking refuge.\n\nAsked in an interview Tuesday with Fox News if he supports Israel going into Rafah, Fetterman said, \"Well, I follow Israel on that. I mean, they would know the situation more than I do.\"\n\n\"And I'm always trying to center this to people, where it's like Hamas could ... Well, they started this,\" Fetterman continued Tuesday. \"They did these kinds of terrible things. And this could end right now if they send all those hostages back home, and they could surrender ... but they clearly don't care about all the Palestinians' death and chaos and damage.\"\n\nThe Biden administration and other Western leaders tried to sway Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu away from a full-scale invasion in recent weeks, arguing it would risk civilian lives and the delivery of crucial aid.\n\nWhite House national security communications adviser John Kirby told reporters Tuesday the U.S. is closely monitoring Israel's actions in Rafah, while noting they did not rise to the level of a full-scale military operation U.S. officials warned against.\n\nNetanyahu has maintained military operations in Rafah will increase pressure on Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip

If they -- voters -- turn their backside to the stove, that fire is going to burn,\" Fetterman said. \"It's really that kind of a choice right now.\"\n\nHis comments come after progressive groups have urged voters participating in presidential primaries in several states to vote \"uncommitted\" to \"apply political pressure on the Biden Administration to reevaluate its stance on the War in Gaza.\"\n\nAccording to USA Today, more than 60,000 Pennsylvania voters chose the write-in option during the April primary.\n\nThe swing state, which went to Biden in 2020, will be closely watched in the rematch this fall between Biden and Trump.

The lone Democrat challenging Biden's hardening stance on Israel", "body": "With his fondness for hoodies and swear words, not to mention his 6ft 8in stature, John Fetterman, the senator for Pennsylvania, has never been one to blend into the political crowd.\n\nBut the Left-wing lawmaker has taken many in his party by surprise to emerge as a key Democratic voice challenging both Joe Biden and pro-Palestine protesters over their stance on Israel.\n\nThe US president has dramatically hardened his stance in recent weeks, even threatening on Wednesday night to withhold arms from Benjamin Netanyahu if the Israeli prime minister's planned invasion of Rafah went ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of students and other young activists have dominated US campuses to protest the Jewish state's military action in Gaza and heap pressure on the Democrats.\n\nWhile most of his Democratic colleagues have attempted to delicately balance supporting Israel's right to defend itself against concern, or even condemnation, of the plight of Gaza's civilian population, Mr Fetterman has set himself apart as an outspoken defender of the Jewish state.\n\nHe has taken the same tongue-in-cheek approach to the pro-Palestine campus protests as he did to great success against his 2022 Republican senate rival.\n\nJust as he mocked Mehmet Oz, the TV doctor, as an out-of-touch elite in viral memes, Mr Fetterman has ridiculed campus protesters on social media as the \"pup tent intifada\".\n\nThe senator's position has taken progressive groups who endorsed him in 2022 by surprise, with some now reconsidering their support.\n\nAn exodus among Mr Fetterman's staff led to speculation aides in his office were also unhappy with his stance on Israel, although he has rejected the suggestion.\n\nOnce a self-proclaimed \"progressive Democrat\", Mr Fetterman's national profile blossomed when he won the backing of Bernie Sanders, the firebrand independent senator for Vermont.\n\nHis uniform of baggy basketball shorts and hoodies, coupled with his distinctive goatee, tattoos and a plain-speaking approach, soon drew him a following.\n\nAlthough he has since eschewed the \"progressive\" mantle he insists he has never wavered on his stances.\n\n\"I said I dress like a slob, I [still] dress like a slob,\" he told USA Today. \"I said I was going to stand with Israel, I stand with Israel. I said I'm going to be a reliable Democratic vote, and I'm still a reliable Democratic vote.\"\n\nMr Fetterman volunteered his time to stump for Mr Biden on the campaign trail but the 54-year-old senator did not shy away from criticising the president.\n\nHours after Mr Biden publicly warned Israel the US could halt the delivery of arms, Mr Fetterman called the policy shift \"deeply disappointing\".\n\nChristopher Nicholas, a veteran Pennsylvania-based Republican political consultant, said: \"He is redefining what it means to be a progressive in the US Senate.\n\n\"From my perspective, Fetterman is revelling in throwing people for a loop,\" he said. \"I also know that it's very concerning to a lot of Pennsylvania moderates who think that they were swindled on his views as a progressive and feel betrayed.\"\n\nMr Nicholas attributes some of Mr Fetterman's \"view on the situation facing Israel\" to an unlikely source: Jeff Bartos, his Republican opponent in the 2018 race to be Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor.\n\nThe pair's friendship was cemented on the campaign trail when Mr Fetterman called Mr Bartos, a devout Jew, minutes after a deadly anti-Semitic attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\nMr Bartos said: \"He just has a huge heart. He's deeply empathetic and he genuinely cares. I remember what he said to me that day: 'brother, you were the first person I thought of, I had to talk to you. I'm so sorry that you and other Jews have to live in a world like this'. I think that's him in a nutshell.\"\n\nHe stressed that he had not spoken to Mr Fetterman in many months, and said: \"I can't speak to what motivates him or why he's doing what he's doing.\"\n\nBut he shared that Mr Fetterman and his wife Gisele had dined at their house and heard his family's stories about Israel and what it meant to them.\n\n\"Whether that had an influence or impact or not, I really couldn't say,\" he added.\n\nWhen not in Washington, Mr Fetterman still lives in Braddock, the steel town which he served as mayor for 13 years, just five miles from the Tree of Life Synagogue.\n\nHe went on to defeat Mr Bartos in 2018 to become Pennsylvania's Lieutenant governor, a post he held until he took up his seat in the US Senate in 2023.\n\nMr Fetterman's senate campaign centred on progressive priorities including criminal justice reform, abolishing the death penalty and legalising cannabis. His victory spanned far beyond the Democratic heartlands of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, into red districts.\n\nMr Fetterman was no stranger to press scrutiny before he even arrived in Washington.\n\nHis senate race was the most closely-watched in the country and took a dramatic turn when he was hospitalised with a serious stroke at the pinnacle of the campaign.\n\nHe was later hospitalised for six weeks to have treatment for clinical depression.\n\nHe has partially attributed his willingness to be outspoken to the perspective his recovery has afforded him, although more cynical minds would suggest Mr Fetterman can afford to speak freely on the issue since he does not face re-election until 2028.\n\nMr Biden's campaign is already aware of the jeopardy the Middle East conflict poses at home, with thousands of young and Left-wing voters casting protest ballots during the Democratic primaries and threatening not to turn out in the general election.\n\nBoth Mr Biden and Mr Fetterman's messaging on Israel will be put to the test in Pennsylvania this November, a crucial state for the party's hopes of retaining both the US Senate and the White House.\n\nAt least one poll, from Quinnipiac University, suggests Mr Fetterman's outspoken rhetoric has not hurt him, with around a quarter of voters saying they viewed him more favourably since he began expressing strong support for Israel. Fourteen per cent said it made them think less favourably of him.\n\nHe is unphased by progressives' threats to stay home in November and potentially hand Donald Trump a second term, declaring with trademark candour: \"If the voters turn their backside to the stove, that fire is going to burn.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors":

John Fetterman (D-PA) has praised the University of Florida's handling of the viral campus protests happening across the United States, arguing that the school has been \"on point\" in its response.\n\nFetterman, one of the most vocal Democratic supporters of Israel, had been asked what the proper response to these college protests would be, with Fetterman pointing to Ben Sasse, the president of the University of Florida and former Republican senator of Nebraska. Sasse stated Sunday that under his leadership, the school has not negotiated with the \"people who scream the loudest\" while not hindering the free speech rights of the protesters.\n\n\"And I thought he was right on point on that,\" Fetterman said on Fox News's Special Report with Brett Baier. \"It's like, we can have protesters, we can have a space to allow that, but you can't take over. We're not going to listen to or respond to or let the fringe or the loudest kinds of voices to respond on that, and you can't have damage, you can't spit on cops, you can't be allowed to stop things from happening. And I thought that's exactly how it should be. It's very much an American value to protest and free speech, but what you have manifested on the campuses now is not that.\"\n\nRegarding the protests itself, Fetterman said he was unsure what the demonstrators were even upset about, arguing that the protesters have gone from calling for a ceasefire to outright calling for Israel's harm. He added that the encampments are not contributing to peace in Gaza and that the protesters ought to be rallying against the Hamas terrorist group over Israel.\n\nLast month, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) cautioned college students not to engage in antisemitic protests, arguing that \"chasing\" Jewish students or teachers is not free speech and would instead be harassment. He also condemned school administrations and presidents at other schools for not standing up for their Jewish students and professors, stating that the leaders are \"weak\" and \"scared.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nFetterman has been outspoken about his support for Israel, attending a massive pro-Israel rally in Washington, D.C., in November. He has also criticized pro-Palestinian protesters for making public disruptions, arguing that blocking bridges or berating people in coffee shops \"just makes you an a**hole.\"\n\nThe multitude of campus protests happening across the country have been happening since last month, with the University of Massachusetts arresting 60 protesters on its own campus. Protesters on the campus had constructed a barricade around the encampment on the university's south lawn, and said they would not leave until their demands were met, which included divesting from any partnerships with weapons manufacturers.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "asher_notheis@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Asher Notheis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Sasse", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Sasse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Massachusetts Amherst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://wex-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24128855350579-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549129", "eventUri": "eng-9549129", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

John Fetterman (D-PA) said that he's down with the Jewish nation's invasion of Rafah, a Hamas stronghold, as it seeks to eradicate the terrorist presence in Gaza.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Democrat has been a pleasant surprise as he has shown a rare independence from the pack on several key issues, one of them being Israel, a key U.S. ally that is despised by many in his party which has become a haven for anti-Semites.\n\nFetterman appeared on Tuesday's edition of \"Special Report\" on Fox News where he was asked about the beginning phase of the long-awaited ground invasion, a perilous situation for President Joe Biden who has been unable to engineer the ceasefire that his base has been demanding.\n\n(Video: Fox News)\n\nAfter mildly criticizing President Joe Biden over the withholding of an arms shipment, the topic turned to the tanks that are rolling into Rafah.\n\n\"Well, I follow Israel on that. I mean they would know the situation more than I do,\" the senator said when asked by anchor Bret Baier if he supported the invasion, said to be a \"red line\" for the White House.\n\n\"I'm always trying to center this to people where it's like Hamas could - well they started this...,\" he continued. \"And this could end right now if they send all those hostages back home, and they could surrender...but they clearly don't care about all the Palestinian death and chaos and damage, in fact that's the way they designed that. Israel actually cares about minimizing those civilian deaths, but Hamas sees that as just their own kinds of collateral damage.\"\n\nThe old-school Democrat also weighed in on the campus protests, an ugly outpouring of anti-Semitism that has been defended by some of his colleagues, most vocally by members of \"The Squad\" who have been the Hamas' best friends in the halls of Congress.\n\n\"I'm not even sure what they're really, you know, protesting about. If you ask them, they're not really sure,\" Fetterman said. \"They can't... and now they're not talking about ceasefires anymore, and now they're talking about divesting and harming Israel and that, it's crazy,\" noting how the protests have morphed from ending the violence to attacks on Israel.\n\n\"It's actually working against peace in Gaza, and Hamas is convinced that they've won the PR war and they keep seeing all these kinds of protests across the nation on these campuses,\" he added. .And it's not helpful, but it's actually, it works against peace, I think.\"\n\nHe also noted that the protests aren't grassroots, as the media have misleadingly portrayed them.\n\n\"They're paid, and I have said this,\" he told Baier. \"I don't care if you're a protester, paid or not. You know, if you've gotta protest anything, you should be protesting against Hamas and demanding that they take the ceasefire, or they can just send all these hostages back home.\"\n\nFetterman has shown little regard for the protesters, previously mocking them by saying \"I don't believe living in a pup tent for Hamas is really helpful.\"\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

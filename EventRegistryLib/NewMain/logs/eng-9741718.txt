(EA Sports via AP, File)\n\nEA Sports College Football 25, among the most highly anticipated sports video games of all time, has flooded the market as gamers who waited more than a decade for the franchise's next installment rush to play.\n\nThe game officially launched Friday, with EA Sports increasing its server capacity ahead of time to handle the crush. More than 2.2 million people had already played the game before launch during an early-access period.\n\n\"To say we've been blown away by the excitement, energy and anticipation around College Football 25 over the past few months would be an understatement,\" EA Sports said in a blog post this week. \"Just like you, our team has had July 19 circled for months as the culmination of so much work and dedication to build this game, and the chance to see it in players' hands for the first time.\"\n\nEA Sports' college football games used to be released annually, a cultural icon in American sports for much of the franchise's existence. The company froze future editions in 2013 when athletes began questioning why they weren't getting paid to be featured in the games.\n\nWith athlete compensation rights sorted out in court and now allowed by the NCAA, EA Sports announced in 2021 it would be reviving the franchise. The video-game developer offered Bowl Subdivision players a minimum of $600 and a copy of the game to have their likeness included in it. More than 11,000 players accepted offers.\n\nEA Sports has said its goal for the game was \"to feel like a love letter to college football and its fans.\"\n\nUCLA, Mississippi State, San Diego State and Colorado were among the schools hosting College Football 25 events this week. Across social platforms, athletes such as LeBron James, Tim Tebow and Michael Vick -- even comedians Shane Gillis and Dan Soder -- were live-streaming head-to-head matches in the game.\n\nMichigan running back Donovan Edwards, one of the cover athletes, said in May some of the best moments of his childhood involved playing EA Sports college football with his best friend.\n\n\"Just for it to be back, as well as to be on the cover of it, it's an awesome feeling,\" he said.\n\nThe game's other standard-edition cover athletes are Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers and Colorado two-way player Travis Hunter. The deluxe edition features the backs of numerous players in a stadium tunnel, including Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe, Georgia quarterback Carson Beck and Ohio State running back Quinshon Judkins.\n\nEA Sports' college football franchise dates to the 1990s. It grew in popularity in the early 2000s as gaming systems became more advanced, allowing for revolutionary game modes such as the popular Race for the Heisman create-a-player that was introduced in NCAA Football 06.\n\nThat edition also featured historic teams, including the 1992 Alabama squad that Clemson coach Dabo Swinney played on.\n\n\"Sleeping on me a little bit,\" Swinney joked about the 70 overall rating for his player, \"WR No. 88,\" which did, however, have a 91 speed rating. \"They must have my going down the Hill speed. I appreciate the love they gave me on that.\"", "source": {"uri": "recordherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Record Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In that time, players have used mods and hacks to keep the aging Xbox 360/PS3-era soccer sim up to date with the real world. But now, after more than a decade of serving its community, NCAA-14 can rest as EA College Football 25 is out and already wildly popular.\n\nTechnically, EA College Football 25 won't launch until July 19th. But like so many publishers, EA is holding the game hostage unless you pay a ransom to play three days early. It's a dirty move, but it hasn't stopped the new sports title from exploding online. According to multiple reports on Twitter, College Football 25 at one point i had more than 660,000 players online simultaneously. Later in the evening it appears that the new game reaches 713,974 online players.\n\nTo put that number in perspective, it's far better than Helldivers 2, which reached a player count of around 485,000 shortly after its launch. It is also more than The first descendantS 264,000 players earlier this month. And that number of players is just a stone's throw away from Baldurspoort 3's peak of 875,000 on Steam last year. In fact, that number would be 713,000 College Football 25 the second biggest game on Steam in the last 48 hours, only Counter Strike 2.\n\nAll of those numbers are impressive on their own, but they're even more impressive when you consider that the game is only available to people who pre-ordered the game. expensive $90 version of College Football 25. Additionally, this game is only available on Xbox Series X/S and PS5, with no previous-gen consoles or Switch versions available, and no Steam or PC port.\n\nIt also seems that EA College Football 25 leads to increased console sales, with more Xbox Series S consoles reportedly sold in the last 24 hours than in any other period outside of the 2020 launch. There is also evidence that the Xbox Series S is selling like hotcakes at Walmart.\n\nI expect this game to only get bigger once it's available to everyone on July 19th. Circana games analyst Mat Piscattela predicts That College Football 25 is set to be in the top 20 best-selling games of 2024, and suggests it could even land in the top 10.

EA Sports College Football 25, among the most highly anticipated sports video games of all time, has flooded the market as gamers who waited more than a decade for the franchise's next installment rush to play it.\n\nBy Ryan Kryska, Associated Press\n\nThursday, July 18, 2024 | 10:50 p.m.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25, among the most highly anticipated sports video games of all time, has flooded the market as gamers who waited more than a decade for the franchise's next installment rush to play.\n\nThe game officially launched Friday, with EA Sports increasing its server capacity during early access to handle the crush.\n\n\"To say we've been blown away by the excitement, energy and anticipation around College Football 25 over the past few months would be an understatement,\" EA Sports said in a blog post this week. \"Just like you, our team has had July 19 circled for months as the culmination of so much work and dedication to build this game, and the chance to see it in players' hands for the first time.\"\n\nEA Sports' college football games used to be released annually, a cultural icon in American sports for much of the franchise's existence. The company froze future editions in 2013 when athletes began questioning why they weren't getting paid to be featured in the games.\n\nWith athlete compensation rights sorted out in court and now allowed by the NCAA, EA Sports announced in 2021 it would be reviving the franchise. The video-game developer offered Bowl Subdivision players a minimum of $600 and a copy of the game to have their likeness included in it. More than 11,000 players accepted offers.\n\nEA Sports has said its goal for the game was \"to feel like a love letter to college football and its fans.\"\n\nSan Diego State and Colorado were among the schools hosting College Football 25 events this week. Across social platforms, athletes such as LeBron James, Tim Tebow and Michael Vick -- even comedians Shane Gillis and Dan Soder -- were live-streaming head-to-head matches in the game.\n\nMichigan running back Donovan Edwards, one of the cover athletes, said in May some of the best moments of his childhood involved playing EA Sports college football with his best friend.\n\n\"Just for it to be back, as well as to be on the cover of it, it's an awesome feeling,\" he said.\n\nThe game's other standard-edition cover athletes are Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers and Colorado two-way player Travis Hunter. The deluxe edition features the backs of numerous players in a stadium tunnel, including Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe, Georgia quarterback Carson Beck and Ohio State running back Quinshon Judkins.\n\nEA Sports' college football franchise dates to the 1990s. It grew in popularity in the early 2000s as gaming systems became more advanced, allowing for revolutionary game modes such as the popular Race for the Heisman create-a-player that was introduced in NCAA Football 06.\n\nThat edition also featured historic teams, including the 1992 Alabama squad that Clemson coach Dabo Swinney played on.\n\n\"Sleeping on me a little bit,\" Swinney joked about the 70 overall rating for his player, \"WR No. 88,\" which did, however, have a 91 speed rating. \"They must have my going down the Hill speed. I appreciate the love they gave me on that.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Pete Iacobelli contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas

No. No. No. No. No. But for dedicated college football fans, the wait was even longer.\n\nBefore this week, Electronic Arts' most recent college football video game -- \"NCAA Football 14\" -- had been released on July 9, 2013. The series was then waylaid by legal disputes surrounding player likenesses, pitched into an 11-year purgatory while the sport painstakingly evolved.\n\nOf course, college athletes were finally permitted to be paid for utilizing their name, image and likeness (NIL) in 2021, which allowed EA to compensate the players it profits from. (Players who opted in received $600 ... and, of course, a copy of the game.)\n\nPeople are also reading...

Clark, a devotee of the series and NHL writer for ESPN.com, told The Seattle Times on Monday.\n\nIt's a holiday steeped in nostalgia -- in midsummer marathons on prehistoric PlayStations, in triple-option offenses and players lost to time, in critical recruiting battles for fictional five-star safeties, in regional conferences (remember them?) and in-state rivalries.\n\n\"NCAA Football 14\" had 20 predecessors, dating to \"Bill Walsh College Football\" in 1993. It also had a frenzied following, a generation of football fans who developed dynasties -- chiseling national champions out of small-school Cinderellas.\n\n\"For me it was really cool, because I got to see really good teams and players that in 1998, in Minneapolis, I wasn't ever going to see play until the bowl game,\" said Dave Southorn, 42, who later covered Boise State football for The Idaho Statesman and The Athletic. \"You got this really good view of the college football landscape through that game.\n\n\"That really helped me, to be frank, as I was figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I was like, 'Oh, this is cool.' I knew things that others didn't. Everyone was talking about Michigan or whoever. I was like, 'Have you heard of Tulane?' \"\n\nClark, likewise, celebrated the annual summer release with a weeklong marathon, as he and a friend staged a sport-wide tournament (modeled after the UEFA Champions League in European soccer) to establish supremacy.\n\n\"We did our own statistical tracking [of games],\" said Clark, 39, who traces the tournament to his high-school years in Florida from 1998 to 2002. \"We were absolute nerds about it, and we totally own it. We absolutely own it.\"\n\nConcluded Clark, who lives in Seattle: \"This is what we would do from 4 o'clock in the afternoon to 2 o'clock in the morning every day for a week.\"\n\nDecades later, the arrival of \"EA Sports College Football 25\" has attracted a similar response, flooding social-media feeds with flea flickers and stadium shots and shaking student sections. As 247Sports college football reporter and podcaster Bud Elliott posted Tuesday on X: \"The EA Sports College Football release has completely upstaged media days buzz. Search trends [online] are wild. To the point where talking college football on a college football show instead of talking about the video game is legit bad business.\"\n\nThe business of college football is also reflected in the game, as players must maneuver NIL deals and the transfer portal to retain top talent. An athlete's academics, leadership skills, health, training and brand all must be monitored.\n\nIndeed, a whole lot happened in the 4,025 days between the releases of \"NCAA Football 14\" and \"EA Sports College Football 25.\"\n\nFor the sport, the franchise ... and its fans.\n\n\"The last time this game came out, I wasn't yet engaged,\" Southorn said. \"I've been married for nine years now. That's how long it's been for me.\"\n\nJoked Clark on Monday morning, in a similar situation: \"When 1 o'clock rolls around, my wife understands that it was a great run for our marriage. We had a lot of great years. We put championships in the rafters. But I'm a ghost to her now, and she knows that, God bless her.\"\n\nSouthorn may soon count among the game-playing ghosts. The University of Colorado alum, who now handles content and communications for a hospital system in Idaho, requested off work Friday to reignite a former flame.\n\n\"Daycare is going to come in clutch,\" said the 42-year-old father and Carnation native. \"I'll get up, take [daughter Kennedy] to day care in the morning. Maybe I'll swing by the doughnut shop and grab something, and then just settle in. I'll probably order a pizza or something at lunch, because I don't want to move.\n\n\"I know I'm in a boat with a whole lot of people. When you get to 40ish and you've got kids, you don't have as much time. But I know I'm literally going to find ways to make time. Because we all need something.\"\n\nThis game, for some, is more than a silly aside -- or a time machine to a tournament lasting until 2 a.m. It's not just nostalgia wrapped in new graphics and updated uniforms.\n\nIt's also a referendum on college football's deepening divide, on the parity diluted by super conferences and media-rights money. It's an individual objection -- a place where Army and Akron and Appalachian State can overwhelm Alabama, where Washington State can pummel its former Pac-12 partners into apologetic pieces.\n\nIt's a place where former Notre Dame and Wake Forest quarterback Sam Hartman -- whose Demon Deacons never defeated Clemson in his five seasons as the starter -- can topple the Tigers, 105-34, as they did Tuesday.\n\n\"Just blowing off some steam...\" Hartman posted, along with a screen shot, on social media.\n\nIt's a place where anything is still possible, provided you can play.\n\n\"I think maybe in the back of our lizard brains, you have some control over it now. You can make the Cinderella story happen,\" Southorn said. \"You can build someone up, where realistically it probably wouldn't happen [in the current era of college football] because of NIL and conference affiliation. You can return it to the way it used to be and feel like college football is a little more even or fair. I think that's a big part of it.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "siouxcityjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sioux City Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_vorel@siouxcityjournal.com", "name": "Mike Vorel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_City,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sioux City, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sioux City, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seattle_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Seattle Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCook_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McCook Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Great_Lakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Great Lakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_High_School_(Sioux_City,_Iowa)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West High School (Sioux City, Iowa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_29", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 29"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

No. No. No. No. No. But for dedicated college football fans, the wait was even longer.\n\nBefore this week, Electronic Arts' most recent college football video game -- \"NCAA Football 14\" -- had been released on July 9, 2013. The series was then waylaid by legal disputes surrounding player likenesses, pitched into an 11-year purgatory while the sport painstakingly evolved.\n\nOf course, college athletes were finally permitted to be paid for utilizing their name, image and likeness (NIL) in 2021, which allowed EA to compensate the players it profits from. (Players who opted in received $600 ... and, of course, a copy of the game.)\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nUPDATE: Cedar Lake woman killed in Monday's storm remembered as 'rock of the family' Davich: Valpo boy pinned under truck to be released from hospital: 'It's a miracle' NWI Business Ins and Outs: Coppolillo's Italian Steakhouse, Veleros Mexican Restaurant, New Age Baking Company, Chick-fil-A, Protein Bar & Kitchen, Chipotle, Chippopotamus and Play It Again Sports opening Pierogi Fest to return for 30th year, feature Blues Brothers impersonators, bluegrass-playing friars and a new 'Who is Smarter than a University of Chicago Physician' game show Coroner identifies deceased in Schererville crash Ex-Crown Point real estate agents indicted on charges of $5 million in COVID relief fraud after allegedly spending money on Porsche and country club Portage mom charged with leaving 4 young children 'to fend for themselves,' cops say Mother charged with neglect after 18-month-old overdoses National Weather Service issues tornado, severe thunderstorm warnings for Northwest Indiana 3 injured by runaway draft horse at LaPorte County Fair Trump injured but 'fine' after attempted assassination at rally; shooter and one attendee are dead Milwaukee Brewers draft Lake Central pitcher Griffin Tobias Davich: Parishioners leave churches to follow Jesus' lead: 'A great moment for our churches' Porter County woman wanted over foster son's death arrested in Michigan Man molested girls, saying he wanted marriage, baby, Portage police say\n\nAt precisely 1 p.m. Monday, the \"Is EA Sports College Football Out\" account posted one more word.\n\nThe wait was over.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"For a lot of people, this is a holiday,\" Ryan S. Clark, a devotee of the series and NHL writer for ESPN.com, told The Seattle Times on Monday.\n\nIt's a holiday steeped in nostalgia -- in midsummer marathons on prehistoric PlayStations, in triple-option offenses and players lost to time, in critical recruiting battles for fictional five-star safeties, in regional conferences (remember them?) and in-state rivalries.\n\n\"NCAA Football 14\" had 20 predecessors, dating to \"Bill Walsh College Football\" in 1993. It also had a frenzied following, a generation of football fans who developed dynasties -- chiseling national champions out of small-school Cinderellas.\n\n\"For me it was really cool, because I got to see really good teams and players that in 1998, in Minneapolis, I wasn't ever going to see play until the bowl game,\" said Dave Southorn, 42, who later covered Boise State football for The Idaho Statesman and The Athletic. \"You got this really good view of the college football landscape through that game.\n\n\"That really helped me, to be frank, as I was figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I was like, 'Oh, this is cool.' I knew things that others didn't. Everyone was talking about Michigan or whoever. I was like, 'Have you heard of Tulane?' \"\n\nClark, likewise, celebrated the annual summer release with a weeklong marathon, as he and a friend staged a sport-wide tournament (modeled after the UEFA Champions League in European soccer) to establish supremacy.\n\n\"We did our own statistical tracking [of games],\" said Clark, 39, who traces the tournament to his high-school years in Florida from 1998 to 2002. \"We were absolute nerds about it, and we totally own it. We absolutely own it.\"\n\nConcluded Clark, who lives in Seattle: \"This is what we would do from 4 o'clock in the afternoon to 2 o'clock in the morning every day for a week.\"\n\nDecades later, the arrival of \"EA Sports College Football 25\" has attracted a similar response, flooding social-media feeds with flea flickers and stadium shots and shaking student sections. As 247Sports college football reporter and podcaster Bud Elliott posted Tuesday on X: \"The EA Sports College Football release has completely upstaged media days buzz. Search trends [online] are wild. To the point where talking college football on a college football show instead of talking about the video game is legit bad business.\"\n\nThe business of college football is also reflected in the game, as players must maneuver NIL deals and the transfer portal to retain top talent. An athlete's academics, leadership skills, health, training and brand all must be monitored.\n\nIndeed, a whole lot happened in the 4,025 days between the releases of \"NCAA Football 14\" and \"EA Sports College Football 25.\"\n\nFor the sport, the franchise ... and its fans.\n\n\"The last time this game came out, I wasn't yet engaged,\" Southorn said. \"I've been married for nine years now. That's how long it's been for me.\"\n\nJoked Clark on Monday morning, in a similar situation: \"When 1 o'clock rolls around, my wife understands that it was a great run for our marriage. We had a lot of great years. We put championships in the rafters. But I'm a ghost to her now, and she knows that, God bless her.\"\n\nSouthorn may soon count among the game-playing ghosts. The University of Colorado alum, who now handles content and communications for a hospital system in Idaho, requested off work Friday to reignite a former flame.\n\n\"Daycare is going to come in clutch,\" said the 42-year-old father and Carnation native. \"I'll get up, take [daughter Kennedy] to day care in the morning. Maybe I'll swing by the doughnut shop and grab something, and then just settle in. I'll probably order a pizza or something at lunch, because I don't want to move.\n\n\"I know I'm in a boat with a whole lot of people.

It's an individual objection -- a place where Army and Akron and Appalachian State can overwhelm Alabama, where Washington State can pummel its former Pac-12 partners into apologetic pieces.\n\nIt's a place where former Notre Dame and Wake Forest quarterback Sam Hartman -- whose Demon Deacons never defeated Clemson in his five seasons as the starter -- can topple the Tigers, 105-34, as they did Tuesday.\n\n\"Just blowing off some steam...\" Hartman posted, along with a screen shot, on social media.\n\nIt's a place where anything is still possible, provided you can play.\n\n\"I think maybe in the back of our lizard brains, you have some control over it now.

No. No. No. No. No. But for dedicated college football fans, the wait was even longer.\n\nBefore this week, Electronic Arts' most recent college football video game -- \"NCAA Football 14\" -- had been released on July 9, 2013. The series was then waylaid by legal disputes surrounding player likenesses, pitched into an 11-year purgatory while the sport painstakingly evolved.\n\nOf course, college athletes were finally permitted to be paid for utilizing their name, image and likeness (NIL) in 2021, which allowed EA to compensate the players it profits from. (Players who opted in received $600 ... and, of course, a copy of the game.)\n\nAt precisely 1 p.m. Monday, the \"Is EA Sports College Football Out\" account posted one more word.\n\nThe wait was over.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"For a lot of people, this is a holiday,\" Ryan S. Clark, a devotee of the series and NHL writer for ESPN.com, told The Seattle Times on Monday.\n\nIt's a holiday steeped in nostalgia -- in midsummer marathons on prehistoric PlayStations, in triple-option offenses and players lost to time, in critical recruiting battles for fictional five-star safeties, in regional conferences (remember them?) and in-state rivalries.\n\n\"NCAA Football 14\" had 20 predecessors, dating to \"Bill Walsh College Football\" in 1993. It also had a frenzied following, a generation of football fans who developed dynasties -- chiseling national champions out of small-school Cinderellas.\n\n\"For me it was really cool, because I got to see really good teams and players that in 1998, in Minneapolis, I wasn't ever going to see play until the bowl game,\" said Dave Southorn, 42, who later covered Boise State football for The Idaho Statesman and The Athletic. \"You got this really good view of the college football landscape through that game.\n\n\"That really helped me, to be frank, as I was figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I was like, 'Oh, this is cool.' I knew things that others didn't. Everyone was talking about Michigan or whoever. I was like, 'Have you heard of Tulane?' \"\n\nClark, likewise, celebrated the annual summer release with a weeklong marathon, as he and a friend staged a sport-wide tournament (modeled after the UEFA Champions League in European soccer) to establish supremacy.\n\n\"We did our own statistical tracking [of games],\" said Clark, 39, who traces the tournament to his high-school years in Florida from 1998 to 2002. \"We were absolute nerds about it, and we totally own it. We absolutely own it.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nConcluded Clark, who lives in Seattle: \"This is what we would do from 4 o'clock in the afternoon to 2 o'clock in the morning every day for a week.\"\n\nDecades later, the arrival of \"EA Sports College Football 25\" has attracted a similar response, flooding social-media feeds with flea flickers and stadium shots and shaking student sections. As 247Sports college football reporter and podcaster Bud Elliott posted Tuesday on X: \"The EA Sports College Football release has completely upstaged media days buzz. Search trends [online] are wild. To the point where talking college football on a college football show instead of talking about the video game is legit bad business.\"\n\nThe business of college football is also reflected in the game, as players must maneuver NIL deals and the transfer portal to retain top talent. An athlete's academics, leadership skills, health, training and brand all must be monitored.\n\nIndeed, a whole lot happened in the 4,025 days between the releases of \"NCAA Football 14\" and \"EA Sports College Football 25.\"\n\nFor the sport, the franchise ... and its fans.\n\n\"The last time this game came out, I wasn't yet engaged,\" Southorn said. \"I've been married for nine years now. That's how long it's been for me.\"\n\nJoked Clark on Monday morning, in a similar situation: \"When 1 o'clock rolls around, my wife understands that it was a great run for our marriage. We had a lot of great years. We put championships in the rafters. But I'm a ghost to her now, and she knows that, God bless her.\"\n\nSouthorn may soon count among the game-playing ghosts. The University of Colorado alum, who now handles content and communications for a hospital system in Idaho, requested off work Friday to reignite a former flame.\n\n\"Daycare is going to come in clutch,\" said the 42-year-old father and Carnation native. \"I'll get up, take [daughter Kennedy] to day care in the morning. Maybe I'll swing by the doughnut shop and grab something, and then just settle in. I'll probably order a pizza or something at lunch, because I don't want to move.\n\n\"I know I'm in a boat with a whole lot of people. When you get to 40ish and you've got kids, you don't have as much time. But I know I'm literally going to find ways to make time. Because we all need something.\"\n\nThis game, for some, is more than a silly aside -- or a time machine to a tournament lasting until 2 a.m. It's not just nostalgia wrapped in new graphics and updated uniforms.\n\nIt's also a referendum on college football's deepening divide, on the parity diluted by super conferences and media-rights money. It's an individual objection -- a place where Army and Akron and Appalachian State can overwhelm Alabama, where Washington State can pummel its former Pac-12 partners into apologetic pieces.\n\nIt's a place where former Notre Dame and Wake Forest quarterback Sam Hartman -- whose Demon Deacons never defeated Clemson in his five seasons as the starter -- can topple the Tigers, 105-34, as they did Tuesday.\n\n\"Just blowing off some steam...\" Hartman posted, along with a screen shot, on social media.\n\nIt's a place where anything is still possible, provided you can play.\n\n\"I think maybe in the back of our lizard brains, you have some control over it now. You can make the Cinderella story happen,\" Southorn said. \"You can build someone up, where realistically it probably wouldn't happen [in the current era of college football] because of NIL and conference affiliation. You can return it to the way it used to be and feel like college football is a little more even or fair. I think that's a big part of it.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "newsadvance.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsAdvance.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_vorel@newsadvance.com", "name": "Mike Vorel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_athlete_compensation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Student athlete compensation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seattle_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Seattle Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walsh_College_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Walsh College Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "247Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_transfer_portal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA transfer portal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_Statesman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Idaho Statesman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane_Green_Wave_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tulane Green Wave football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise_State_Broncos_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boise State Broncos football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

EA Sports College Football 25, among the most highly anticipated sports video games of all time, has flooded the market as gamers who waited more than a decade for the franchise's next installment rush to play it. (EA Sports via AP, File)\n\nEA Sports College Football 25, among the most highly anticipated sports video games of all time, has flooded the market as gamers who waited more than a decade for the franchise's next installment rush to play.\n\nThe game officially launched Friday, with EA Sports increasing its server capacity during early access to handle the crush.\n\n\"To say we've been blown away by the excitement, energy and anticipation around College Football 25 over the past few months would be an understatement,\" EA Sports said in a blog post this week. \"Just like you, our team has had July 19 circled for months as the culmination of so much work and dedication to build this game, and the chance to see it in players' hands for the first time.\"\n\nEA Sports' college football games used to be released annually, a cultural icon in American sports for much of the franchise's existence. The company froze future editions in 2013 when athletes began questioning why they weren't getting paid to be featured in the games.\n\nWith athlete compensation rights sorted out in court and now allowed by the NCAA, EA Sports announced in 2021 it would be reviving the franchise. The video-game developer offered Bowl Subdivision players a minimum of $600 and a copy of the game to have their likeness included in it. More than 11,000 players accepted offers.\n\nEA Sports has said its goal for the game was \"to feel like a love letter to college football and its fans.\"\n\nSan Diego State and Colorado were among the schools hosting College Football 25 events this week. Across social platforms, athletes such as LeBron James, Tim Tebow and Michael Vick -- even comedians Shane Gillis and Dan Soder -- were live-streaming head-to-head matches in the game.\n\nMichigan running back Donovan Edwards, one of the cover athletes, said in May some of the best moments of his childhood involved playing EA Sports college football with his best friend.\n\n\"Just for it to be back, as well as to be on the cover of it, it's an awesome feeling,\" he said.\n\nThe game's other standard-edition cover athletes are Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers and Colorado two-way player Travis Hunter. The deluxe edition features the backs of numerous players in a stadium tunnel, including Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe, Georgia quarterback Carson Beck and Ohio State running back Quinshon Judkins.\n\nEA Sports' college football franchise dates to the 1990s. It grew in popularity in the early 2000s as gaming systems became more advanced, allowing for revolutionary game modes such as the popular Race for the Heisman create-a-player that was introduced in NCAA Football 06.\n\nThat edition also featured historic teams, including the 1992 Alabama squad that Clemson coach Dabo Swinney played on.\n\n\"Sleeping on me a little bit,\" Swinney joked about the 70 overall rating for his player, \"WR No. 88,\" which did, however, have a 91 speed rating. \"They must have my going down the Hill speed. I appreciate the love they gave me on that.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Pete Iacobelli contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football.

The game was initially released on July 15 in early access but is out now for everyone.\n\nAfter so many years away, many might be wondering if the wait has indeed been worth it. In this post, we're rounding up review scores and excerpts to help you decide if the game may be worth your time and money.\n\nIf you're curious but don't necessarily want to buy the game right away, EA Play subscribers have access to a 10-hour trial right now; Game Pass Ultimate members have this benefit as well since the membership includes EA Play.\n\nCollege Football 25 is already doing well, as the game reached 2.2 million unique players during the early-access window, while another 600,000 people have tried the EA Play trial.\n\nEA's last college football game before this was 2013's NCAA Football 14. EA and the NCAA broke off their partnership due to a variety of reasons, including legal problems and lawsuits. Instead, EA brokered separate licensing deals to feature all 134 FBS schools in College Football 25. And in a major change, EA is paying athletes to be in the game as part of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals.\n\nCollege Football 25 is available on console for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but not last-gen consoles, PC, or Nintendo Switch.\n\nIf you're just getting started with College Football 25, you may want to check out GameSpot's College Football 25 launch guide.\n\nYou can see a sampling of review scores for College Football 25 below. For more on the critical reaction, be sure to visit GameSpot sister site Metacritic.\n\n\"College Football 25's presentation is light-years beyond what developer EA Orlando has been doing with Madden. You can see sweat on individual players, the lighting is exceptional, and everything pops visually in a way that Madden just doesn't. There's also just a lot more stuff to enjoy, from the unique intros for each team as they take the field to mascots dancing around when their school pulls off a big play.\" -- Will Borger [Full review]\n\n\"When I heard EA was bringing college football back, I was fully prepared to play a game of Madden with college uniforms. In all honesty, I would have played it and been mildly satisfied. EA delivered a much deeper experience that easily carves its own identity in every way possible. Once EA learns its way around the restrictions of the NIL situation, the series will go to an even higher level.\" -- Brian Mazique [Full review]\n\nIt's a testament to what is possible with sports games when teams have longer than a few months to crank out AAA titles. And if this is the foundation for future college football games, then the series is in a very, very good place.\" -- Matt Brown [Full review]\n\n\"From nowhere, it's suddenly the sports game that all others have to beat.\" -- Ben Wilson [Full review]\n\n\"EA put all of its chips into College Football 25, and it truly paid off. People are buying consoles just to play this game. It's a cultural phenomenon and the experience that's provided isn't replicated anywhere else. All the new additions to help make the game stand out including Wear and Tear, Turbo Mode, different coverage shells and added hot routes for pre-play, and basically everything added isn't just a gimmick, it's a substantial change. While some bugs and logic need to be addressed, College Football 25 is undoubtedly the most fun football game to come out in years. Everything College Football is here.\" -- Cory Wells [Full review]", "source": {"uri": "gamespot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eddie_makuch@gamespot.com", "name": "Eddie Makuch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Play", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "EA Play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Early access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GameSpot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Game_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Game Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Bowl_Subdivision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metacritic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turbo (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AAA (video game industry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "H.

No. No. No. No. No. But for dedicated college football fans, the wait was even longer.\n\nBefore this week, Electronic Arts' most recent college football video game - \"NCAA Football 14\" - had been released on July 9, 2013. The series was then waylaid by legal disputes surrounding player likenesses, pitched into an 11-year purgatory while the sport painstakingly evolved.\n\nOf course, college athletes were finally permitted to be paid for utilizing their name, image and likeness (NIL) in 2021, which allowed EA to compensate the players it profits from. (Players who opted in received $600 ... and, of course, a copy of the game.)\n\nAt precisely 1 p.m. Monday, the \"Is EA Sports College Football Out\" account posted one more word.\n\n\"For a lot of people, this is a holiday,\" Ryan S. Clark, a devotee of the series and NHL writer for ESPN.com, told The Seattle Times on Monday.\n\nIt's a holiday steeped in nostalgia - in midsummer marathons on prehistoric PlayStations, in triple-option offenses and players lost to time, in critical recruiting battles for fictional five-star safeties, in regional conferences (remember them?) and in-state rivalries.\n\n\"NCAA Football 14\" had 20 predecessors, dating to \"Bill Walsh College Football\" in 1993. It also had a frenzied following, a generation of football fans who developed dynasties - chiseling national champions out of small-school Cinderellas.\n\n\"For me it was really cool, because I got to see really good teams and players that in 1998, in Minneapolis, I wasn't ever going to see play until the bowl game,\" said Dave Southorn, 42, who later covered Boise State football for The Idaho Statesman and The Athletic. \"You got this really good view of the college football landscape through that game.\n\n\"That really helped me, to be frank, as I was figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I was like, 'Oh, this is cool.' I knew things that others didn't. Everyone was talking about Michigan or whoever. I was like, 'Have you heard of Tulane?' \"\n\nClark, likewise, celebrated the annual summer release with a weeklong marathon, as he and a friend staged a sport-wide tournament (modeled after the UEFA Champions League in European soccer) to establish supremacy.\n\n\"We did our own statistical tracking [of games],\" said Clark, 39, who traces the tournament to his high-school years in Florida from 1998 to 2002. \"We were absolute nerds about it, and we totally own it. We absolutely own it.\"\n\nConcluded Clark, who lives in Seattle: \"This is what we would do from 4 o'clock in the afternoon to 2 o'clock in the morning every day for a week.\"\n\nDecades later, the arrival of \"EA Sports College Football 25\" has attracted a similar response, flooding social-media feeds with flea flickers and stadium shots and shaking student sections. As 247Sports college football reporter and podcaster Bud Elliott posted Tuesday on X: \"The EA Sports College Football release has completely upstaged media days buzz. Search trends [online] are wild. To the point where talking college football on a college football show instead of talking about the video game is legit bad business.\"\n\nThe business of college football is also reflected in the game, as players must maneuver NIL deals and the transfer portal to retain top talent. An athlete's academics, leadership skills, health, training and brand all must be monitored.\n\nIndeed, a whole lot happened in the 4,025 days between the releases of \"NCAA Football 14\" and \"EA Sports College Football 25.\"\n\nFor the sport, the franchise ... and its fans.\n\n\"The last time this game came out, I wasn't yet engaged,\" Southorn said. \"I've been married for nine years now. That's how long it's been for me.\"\n\nJoked Clark on Monday morning, in a similar situation: \"When 1 o'clock rolls around, my wife understands that it was a great run for our marriage. We had a lot of great years. We put championships in the rafters. But I'm a ghost to her now, and she knows that, God bless her.\"\n\nSouthorn may soon count among the game-playing ghosts. The University of Colorado alum, who now handles content and communications for a hospital system in Idaho, requested off work Friday to reignite a former flame.\n\n\"Daycare is going to come in clutch,\" said the 42-year-old father and Carnation native. \"I'll get up, take [daughter Kennedy] to day care in the morning. Maybe I'll swing by the doughnut shop and grab something, and then just settle in. I'll probably order a pizza or something at lunch, because I don't want to move.\n\n\"I know I'm in a boat with a whole lot of people. When you get to 40ish and you've got kids, you don't have as much time. But I know I'm literally going to find ways to make time. Because we all need something.\"\n\nThis game, for some, is more than a silly aside - or a time machine to a tournament lasting until 2 a.m. It's not just nostalgia wrapped in new graphics and updated uniforms.\n\nIt's also a referendum on college football's deepening divide, on the parity diluted by super conferences and media-rights money. It's an individual objection - a place where Army and Akron and Appalachian State can overwhelm Alabama, where Washington State can pummel its former Pac-12 partners into apologetic pieces.\n\nIt's a place where former Notre Dame and Wake Forest quarterback Sam Hartman - whose Demon Deacons never defeated Clemson in his five seasons as the starter - can topple the Tigers, 105-34, as they did Tuesday.\n\n\"Just blowing off some steam...\" Hartman posted, along with a screen shot, on social media.\n\nIt's a place where anything is still possible, provided you can play.\n\n\"I think maybe in the back of our lizard brains, you have some control over it now. You can make the Cinderella story happen,\" Southorn said. \"You can build someone up, where realistically it probably wouldn't happen [in the current era of college football] because of NIL and conference affiliation. You can return it to the way it used to be and feel like college football is a little more even or fair. I think that's a big part of it.\"", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_vorel@bradenton.com", "name": "Mike Vorel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walsh_College_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Walsh College Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seattle_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Seattle Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "247Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_Statesman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Idaho Statesman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane_Green_Wave_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tulane Green Wave football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise_State_Broncos_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boise State Broncos football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_section", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Student section"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowl game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The company froze future editions in 2013 when athletes began questioning why they weren't getting paid to be featured in the games.\n\nWith athlete compensation rights sorted out in court and now allowed by the NCAA, EA Sports announced in 2021 it would be reviving the franchise. The video-game developer offered Bowl Subdivision players a minimum of $600 and a copy of the game to have their likeness included in it. More than 11,000 players accepted offers.\n\nEA Sports has said its goal for the game was \"to feel like a love letter to college football and its fans.\"\n\nSan Diego State and Colorado were among the schools hosting College Football 25 events this week. Across social platforms, athletes such as LeBron James, Tim Tebow and Michael Vick - even comedians Shane Gillis and Dan Soder - were live-streaming head-to-head matches in the game.\n\nMichigan running back Donovan Edwards, one of the cover athletes, said in May some of the best moments of his childhood involved playing EA Sports college football with his best friend.\n\n\"Just for it to be back, as well as to be on the cover of it, it\u00b4s an awesome feeling,\" he said.\n\nThe game's other standard-edition cover athletes are Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers and Colorado two-way player Travis Hunter. The deluxe edition features the backs of numerous players in a stadium tunnel, including Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe, Georgia quarterback Carson Beck and Ohio State running back Quinshon Judkins.\n\nEA Sports' college football franchise dates to the 1990s. It grew in popularity in the early 2000s as gaming systems became more advanced, allowing for revolutionary game modes such as the popular Race for the Heisman create-a-player that was introduced in NCAA Football 06.\n\nThat edition also featured historic teams, including the 1992 Alabama squad that Clemson coach Dabo Swinney played on.\n\n\"Sleeping on me a little bit,\" Swinney joked about the 70 overall rating for his player, \"WR No. 88,\" which did, however, have a 91 speed rating. \"They must have my going down the Hill speed. I appreciate the love they gave me on that.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Pete Iacobelli contributed to this report.\n\nAP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football.

(Image credit: Electronic Arts)\n\nOne of the most highly anticipated sports games in history, EA Sports College Football 25, is finally here -- and it's already become a top seller on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.\n\nThat news comes from Mat Piscatella, executive director and video game industry advisor at the market research firm Circana. According to a recent post from Piscatella, data from Circana's Player Engagement Tracker indicates that on July 17, the game ranked #3 in US daily active users on Xbox and #4 on PS5, with the megahit only falling short of titles like Call of Duty, Fortnite, and Grand Theft Auto V.\n\nNotably, this data was drawn before the game even left early access and launched for everyone who purchased the game on Friday. That means the players who helped EA Sports College Football 25 hit this milestone were all folks who spent $100 to preorder the Deluxe Edition of the game -- and also that its daily active users count will likely skyrocket even higher now that buyers of the standard $69.99 edition can jump in.\n\nHistorically, sports games have always been popular, but even with that in mind, the explosive success of EA Sports College Football 25 stands out. There's a good reason for it, though: there hasn't been a college football video game in over 11 years, with the last before this one being 2013's NCAA Football 14 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. That makes publisher Electronic Arts' (EA) new game a uniquely special release, and one that fans have waited more than a decade for.\n\nThe reason behind the hiatus is a legal one; after NCAA Football 14's release, EA and its licensing partner, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), faced a lawsuit from college football players who argued their likeness was used in the game without compensation. As part of its settlement, EA said it wouldn't make new college football games, but after the US Supreme Court ruled the NCAA's tendency to avoid fiscal compensation was a breach of antitrust law in the 2021 NCAA v. Alston case, the NCAA created new rules for likeness compensation. In 2023, EA then spoke with ESPN, announcing that players would have the option to opt into appearing in a new 2024 college football game and that they would be compensated for doing so.\n\nWith both this context and the extreme popularity of college football in the US in mind, it's easy to see why EA Sports College Football 25 is blowing up. Note that while there aren't publicly available player counts at the time of writing, Piscatella posted a humorous GIF on Friday that makes it clear the game is performing very, very well.\n\nI don't enjoy sports games myself, but even so, it's awesome to see those who do finally get a new college football entry after 11 years. Since 2013, fans have had to rely on community-made NCAA Football 14 mods to enjoy a somewhat modern college football gaming experience. Not anymore.\n\nOne disappointing thing about the new game is that it's not available on Windows PC through any platform or service, which I'd guess is due to concerns about mods and licensing (perhaps the game will come to PC eventually; after all, Madden is on it). Its exclusivity to Xbox Series X|S and PS5 does make it something of a system seller for those consoles, though, as unlike most new EA Sports games, it's not playable on the last-gen Xbox One or PS4.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 is also not available on Xbox Game Pass, which is Microsoft's buffet-style subscription service that gives members access to hundreds of games for a monthly fee. It is, however, discounted by $7 for EA Play members, which you get with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for no additional cost (in time, it may also become fully playable through EA Play). Sony's PlayStation Plus does not include EA Play in any tier, so if you have Game Pass Ultimate already, Xbox is the best place to play.", "source": {"uri": "windowscentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Windows Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brendan_lowry@windowscentral.com", "name": "Brendan Lowry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sports video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortnite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Early access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Theft Auto V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Call of Duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox 360"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EA Play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Developers_and_Publishers/Independent_Developers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Developers and Publishers/Independent Developers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Economy_and_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Economy and Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nwz5b63mgDcYgCAPmJXGp8-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 535, "textEnd": 542}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Manning announced Tuesday, July 9, 2024, his likeness will be used in EA Sports College Football 25 following reports he had declined the game developer's offer to be featured in it.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25, among the most highly anticipated sports video games of all time, has flooded the market as gamers who waited more than a decade for the franchise's next installment rush to play.\n\nThe game officially launched Friday, with EA Sports increasing its server capacity during early access to handle the crush.\n\n\"To say we've been blown away by the excitement, energy and anticipation around College Football 25 over the past few months would be an understatement,\" EA Sports said in a blog post this week. \"Just like you, our team has had July 19 circled for months as the culmination of so much work and dedication to build this game, and the chance to see it in players' hands for the first time.\"\n\nEA Sports' college football games used to be released annually, a cultural icon in American sports for much of the franchise's existence. The company froze future editions in 2013 when athletes began questioning why they weren't getting paid to be featured in the games.\n\nWith athlete compensation rights sorted out in court and now allowed by the NCAA, EA Sports announced in 2021 it would be reviving the franchise. The video-game developer offered Bowl Subdivision players a minimum of $600 and a copy of the game to have their likeness included in it. More than 11,000 players accepted offers.\n\nEA Sports has said its goal for the game was \"to feel like a love letter to college football and its fans.\"\n\nSan Diego State and Colorado were among the schools hosting College Football 25 events this week. Across social platforms, athletes such as LeBron James, Tim Tebow and Michael Vick -- even comedians Shane Gillis and Dan Soder -- were live-streaming head-to-head matches in the game.\n\nMichigan running back Donovan Edwards, one of the cover athletes, said in May some of the best moments of his childhood involved playing EA Sports college football with his best friend.\n\n\"Just for it to be back, as well as to be on the cover of it, it's an awesome feeling,\" he said.\n\nThe game's other standard-edition cover athletes are Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers and Colorado two-way player Travis Hunter. The deluxe edition features the backs of numerous players in a stadium tunnel, including Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe, Georgia quarterback Carson Beck and Ohio State running back Quinshon Judkins.\n\nEA Sports' college football franchise dates to the 1990s. It grew in popularity in the early 2000s as gaming systems became more advanced, allowing for revolutionary game modes such as the popular Race for the Heisman create-a-player that was introduced in NCAA Football 06.\n\nThat edition also featured historic teams, including the 1992 Alabama squad that Clemson coach Dabo Swinney played on.\n\n\"Sleeping on me a little bit,\" Swinney joked about the 70 overall rating for his player, \"WR No. 88,\" which did, however, have a 91 speed rating. \"They must have my going down the Hill speed. I appreciate the love they gave me on that.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Pete Iacobelli contributed to this report.\n\nAP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football.

It's unclear if the 2.2 million number refers to both deluxe edition owners and EA Play subscribers, however.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n'This game is for the fans, and the response we've seen from across the collegiate landscape, athletes, creators, celebrities, and the core community has been nothing short of spectacular,\" Daryl Holt, senior vice president of EA Sports, said in the press release.\n\nThis is a momentous release for EA Sports. It's the first time EA has released a college football video game since NCAA Football 14 in 2013. At the time, the NCAA didn't allow college athletes to get paid for their likenesses, so EA used fake names. This caused some friction between the two entities, so the contract wasn't renewed. EA Sports announced it was getting back into college football in 2021. This time around, EA was able to use real athletes because the NCAA changed its position on paying its players.\n\nCollege Football 25, by many accounts, is also an excellent sports game. Digital Trends' Tomas Franzese called it \"the best EA Sports game that I've played in years\" thanks to new modes that allow for more customization and deeper gameplay. It also looks fantastic thanks to the Frostbite Engine.\n\nIn other College Football 25 news, according to multiple reports, the players were paid a minimum of $600 for their name, image, and likeness, referred to as NIL. They also got a free copy of the game. This includes every player who submitted, says the New York Times, while those who were featured more prominently in the game's marketing or were on the box cover were paid more. That amounts to around 14,000 players, although less than 100 will be featured.\n\n\"Ninety-plus percent of these athletes will never have [another] NIL opportunity ... And the fact that they can be in a video game is just cool,\" Sean O'Brien, head of strategic partnerships at EA Sports, told the New York Times.", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carli_velocci@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Carli Velocci", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Early access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Play", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "EA Play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Trends", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital Trends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite_(game_engine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frostbite (game engine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Economy_and_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Economy and Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EA-Sports-College-Football-25-quarterback.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 93, "textEnd": 100}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

More than 2.2 million people had already played the game before launch during an early-access period.\n\n\"To say we've been blown away by the excitement, energy and anticipation around College Football 25 over the past few months would be an understatement,\" EA Sports said in a blog post this week. \"Just like you, our team has had July 19 circled for months as the culmination of so much work and dedication to build this game, and the chance to see it in players' hands for the first time.\"\n\nEA Sports' college football games used to be released annually, a cultural icon in American sports for much of the franchise's existence. The company froze future editions in 2013 when athletes began questioning why they weren't getting paid to be featured in the games.\n\nWith athlete compensation rights sorted out in court and now allowed by the NCAA, EA Sports announced in 2021 it would be reviving the franchise. The video-game developer offered Bowl Subdivision players a minimum of $600 and a copy of the game to have their likeness included in it. More than 11,000 players accepted offers.\n\nEA Sports has said its goal for the game was \"to feel like a love letter to college football and its fans.\"\n\nUCLA, Mississippi State, San Diego State and Colorado were among the schools hosting College Football 25 events this week. Across social platforms, athletes such as LeBron James, Tim Tebow and Michael Vick -- even comedians Shane Gillis and Dan Soder -- were live-streaming head-to-head matches in the game.\n\nMichigan running back Donovan Edwards, one of the cover athletes, said in May some of the best moments of his childhood involved playing EA Sports college football with his best friend.\n\n\"Just for it to be back, as well as to be on the cover of it, it's an awesome feeling,\" he said.\n\nThe game's other standard-edition cover athletes are Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers and Colorado two-way player Travis Hunter. The deluxe edition features the backs of numerous players in a stadium tunnel, including Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe, Georgia quarterback Carson Beck and Ohio State running back Quinshon Judkins.\n\nEA Sports' college football franchise dates to the 1990s. It grew in popularity in the early 2000s as gaming systems became more advanced, allowing for revolutionary game modes such as the popular Race for the Heisman create-a-player that was introduced in NCAA Football 06.\n\nThat edition also featured historic teams, including the 1992 Alabama squad that Clemson coach Dabo Swinney played on.\n\n\"Sleeping on me a little bit,\" Swinney joked about the 70 overall rating for his player, \"WR No. 88,\" which did, however, have a 91 speed rating. \"They must have my going down the Hill speed.

No. No. No. No. No. But for dedicated college football fans, the wait was even longer.\n\nBefore this week, Electronic Arts' most recent college football video game -- \"NCAA Football 14\" -- had been released on July 9, 2013. The series was then waylaid by legal disputes surrounding player likenesses, pitched into an 11-year purgatory while the sport painstakingly evolved.\n\nOf course, college athletes were finally permitted to be paid for utilizing their name, image and likeness (NIL) in 2021, which allowed EA to compensate the players it profits from. (Players who opted in received $600 ... and, of course, a copy of the game.)\n\nPeople are also reading...

Clark, a devotee of the series and NHL writer for ESPN.com, told The Seattle Times on Monday.\n\nIt's a holiday steeped in nostalgia -- in midsummer marathons on prehistoric PlayStations, in triple-option offenses and players lost to time, in critical recruiting battles for fictional five-star safeties, in regional conferences (remember them?) and in-state rivalries.\n\n\"NCAA Football 14\" had 20 predecessors, dating to \"Bill Walsh College Football\" in 1993. It also had a frenzied following, a generation of football fans who developed dynasties -- chiseling national champions out of small-school Cinderellas.\n\n\"For me it was really cool, because I got to see really good teams and players that in 1998, in Minneapolis, I wasn't ever going to see play until the bowl game,\" said Dave Southorn, 42, who later covered Boise State football for The Idaho Statesman and The Athletic. \"You got this really good view of the college football landscape through that game.\n\n\"That really helped me, to be frank, as I was figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I was like, 'Oh, this is cool.' I knew things that others didn't. Everyone was talking about Michigan or whoever. I was like, 'Have you heard of Tulane?' \"\n\nClark, likewise, celebrated the annual summer release with a weeklong marathon, as he and a friend staged a sport-wide tournament (modeled after the UEFA Champions League in European soccer) to establish supremacy.\n\n\"We did our own statistical tracking [of games],\" said Clark, 39, who traces the tournament to his high-school years in Florida from 1998 to 2002. \"We were absolute nerds about it, and we totally own it. We absolutely own it.\"\n\nConcluded Clark, who lives in Seattle: \"This is what we would do from 4 o'clock in the afternoon to 2 o'clock in the morning every day for a week.\"\n\nDecades later, the arrival of \"EA Sports College Football 25\" has attracted a similar response, flooding social-media feeds with flea flickers and stadium shots and shaking student sections. As 247Sports college football reporter and podcaster Bud Elliott posted Tuesday on X: \"The EA Sports College Football release has completely upstaged media days buzz. Search trends [online] are wild. To the point where talking college football on a college football show instead of talking about the video game is legit bad business.\"\n\nThe business of college football is also reflected in the game, as players must maneuver NIL deals and the transfer portal to retain top talent. An athlete's academics, leadership skills, health, training and brand all must be monitored.\n\nIndeed, a whole lot happened in the 4,025 days between the releases of \"NCAA Football 14\" and \"EA Sports College Football 25.\"\n\nFor the sport, the franchise ... and its fans.\n\n\"The last time this game came out, I wasn't yet engaged,\" Southorn said. \"I've been married for nine years now. That's how long it's been for me.\"\n\nJoked Clark on Monday morning, in a similar situation: \"When 1 o'clock rolls around, my wife understands that it was a great run for our marriage. We had a lot of great years. We put championships in the rafters. But I'm a ghost to her now, and she knows that, God bless her.\"\n\nSouthorn may soon count among the game-playing ghosts. The University of Colorado alum, who now handles content and communications for a hospital system in Idaho, requested off work Friday to reignite a former flame.\n\n\"Daycare is going to come in clutch,\" said the 42-year-old father and Carnation native. \"I'll get up, take [daughter Kennedy] to day care in the morning. Maybe I'll swing by the doughnut shop and grab something, and then just settle in. I'll probably order a pizza or something at lunch, because I don't want to move.\n\n\"I know I'm in a boat with a whole lot of people. When you get to 40ish and you've got kids, you don't have as much time. But I know I'm literally going to find ways to make time. Because we all need something.\"\n\nThis game, for some, is more than a silly aside -- or a time machine to a tournament lasting until 2 a.m. It's not just nostalgia wrapped in new graphics and updated uniforms.\n\nIt's also a referendum on college football's deepening divide, on the parity diluted by super conferences and media-rights money. It's an individual objection -- a place where Army and Akron and Appalachian State can overwhelm Alabama, where Washington State can pummel its former Pac-12 partners into apologetic pieces.\n\nIt's a place where former Notre Dame and Wake Forest quarterback Sam Hartman -- whose Demon Deacons never defeated Clemson in his five seasons as the starter -- can topple the Tigers, 105-34, as they did Tuesday.\n\n\"Just blowing off some steam...\" Hartman posted, along with a screen shot, on social media.\n\nIt's a place where anything is still possible, provided you can play.\n\n\"I think maybe in the back of our lizard brains, you have some control over it now. You can make the Cinderella story happen,\" Southorn said. \"You can build someone up, where realistically it probably wouldn't happen [in the current era of college football] because of NIL and conference affiliation. You can return it to the way it used to be and feel like college football is a little more even or fair.

Although it's been over a decade since their last college game, College Football 25 offers many classic modes that fans grew to love over the years. They've even added some new modes and unique features that set it apart from its predecessor and Madden NFL. But do all these changes make College Football 25 worth your time and money? Let's find out in this College Football 25 Review.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 Review - What is College Football 25?\n\nCollege Football 25 is EA Sports' first college football video game since NCAA 14 was released in 2013. In the time between now and then, we've seen both the release of GTA V and the reveal of GTA VI. We've even seen two additional generations of consoles (PS4, Xbox One -> PS5, Xbox Series X) launch.\n\nEA Sports' first entry into the video game realm of collegiate football took place in 1993 when they released Bill Walsh College Football for the SNES, Sega Genesis, and Sega CD. After another Bill Walsh game in 94, they then briefly changed the name of the series to College Football USA between 1995-1996.\n\nThen, EA Sports changed the name of the series to the one most players recognize - NCAA Football - which they ran with from 1997-2013. Over the years, EA Sports added more improvements to the series, including fan-favorite modes like Dynasty and Road to Glory.\n\nHowever, after NCAA 14 was released in 2013, EA stopped making college football games for a while. Explaining it would take forever. But essentially, it was a series of long-lasting legal battles revolving around NIL amongst other things. But for years that's all the news we had about College Football 25. So let's just put those stories aside and focus on the game.\n\nCollege Football 25 features all 134 FBS Schools along with over 14,000 real players who opted into the game. The game runs on Frostbite Engine and is available for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. The game is not available on PC, PS4, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch. Without further ado, let's dive into our College Football 25 review.\n\nCollege Football 25 Review - Gameplay\n\nThe last time I played a College Football video game was back in 2019 with my roommates back at Temple University. So, of course, I had to play my first-ever game as the Owls. Upon starting my first game, I was already impressed with so many things.\n\nEA Sports did a phenomenal job of capturing each team's intro and stadium details. Furthermore, there's so much more in terms of presentation. From mascots running out to the field, to players running out in different ways, I was quickly blown away by the attention to detail.\n\nOn my first ever play, a regular HB Dive, I noticed immediately how fast and smooth player movement is. It almost feels like NCAA Football 14 but with some slight influence from Madden. Now, as you can tell from the title, I don't think College Football 25 is a Madden re-skin. But understandably, it borrows a few elements, thanks to running on the Frostbite engine.\n\nIn my Madden 24 and even FC 24 review, I wrote that Frostbite engine made player movement feel awkward. In those games, it looks like players run with a stick up their rear. However, College Football 25's player animations look smooth. When a QB is running out of the pocket, or if a HB jukes to break a defender's ankles, everything looks so clean.\n\nAnother thing that reminds me of NCAA Football 14 is the way players break tackles in College Football 25. Sometimes your player just turns into the Incredible Hulk and refuses to go down. Once I managed to get Kansas RB Devin Neal to break 4 tackles as he ran down the field for a touchdown.\n\nHowever, that rule applies both ways. Sometimes your defenders will be helpless against that massive TE or physical WR. It just reminds you that you're not playing the Pros like Madden and you'll need to strategize better.\n\nThankfully, College Football 25 features all 134 playbooks from every school in the game. While many of them share similarities, each playbook reflects both the offensive and defensive identities of their schools. And if you still can't find something you want, the game gives you the option to create your own custom playbooks. Just pick a playbook from any of the schools, and customize it with your favorite plays.\n\nOne thing I was worried about before playing was seeing the new Wear & Tear System. Essentially, every hit your player takes impacts your player's health. You get a diagram showing which limbs are affected and their level of wear and tear. The more damage you take, the more your attributes are affected.\n\nMy initial concern was that this would feel too \"arcadey\" or unfair. But thankfully my concerns were put to rest after playing a few games. Overall, Wear & Tear only seems to occur when you put players in a position to get hurt. If you keep scrambling with your QB, you risk that tear on his body. Run 30+ times with a HB, you risk his chances of getting hurt.\n\nIf anything, Wear & Tear feels extremely helpful. I use it to help me identify which players I should sub out. In Dynasty, I like to give my younger guys playing time. So when my starters take some damage, or if I'm up by multiple scores, I put my younger guys in and reduce my risk of injury. So Wear & Tear feels like a great way of helping you prevent injuries.\n\nAnother gimmick that I was concerned about was Mental and Physical Abilities. When I first heard about them, the first thought that came to my mind was the ridiculous X-Factors from Madden. However, I've fortunately been proven wrong once again, as Abilities feel great, but not overpowered.\n\nThink of Abilities like Badges from NBA 2K. They make your players better in certain situations but also don't overpower them. Furthermore, there are different tiers of Abilities, with bronze being the lowest, and platinum being the highest. Some abilities make your receiver a better catcher in traffic, while others make your corners a more efficient ballhawk.\n\nRegardless, Abilities make the game more exciting without compromising the authenticity of the game. Furthermore, it makes searching for recruits in Dynasty more fun. Do you want a 3-star player with basic abilities? Or do you want to go all in on a 5-star recruit with strong Mentals? Abilities add a fun level of strategy that enhances the gameplay of CFB 25.\n\nAnother feature that feels nice is the new Stadium Pulse mechanic. Essentially, you'll face tougher challenges on the road depending on where you play. If you play a road game at Texas A&M in a battle for the conference, expect the fans to give you a hard time.\n\nNow, Stadium Pulse affects your player similarly to how it did in NCAA Football 14. You'll see squiggly receiver routes, disappearing receiver icons, and more. Unlike the momentum mechanic from Madden 24, Stadium Pulse feels empowering, but not indestructible. You can easily shut a crowd up by continuing to dominate in a game. Overall, Stadium Pulse is another fantastic feature in CFB 25.\n\nBut how does the actual gameplay on the field feel?\n\nCollege Football 25 offers a new passing type, along with three familiar passing types from Madden. Overall, the options include Revamped Passing, Placement, Placement & Accuracy, and Classic. While I prefer Classic, the Revamped passing system does feel good. It takes time getting used to, but feels comfortable once you get the hang of it.\n\nEssentially, the Revamped passing revolves around the power of your throw with a new meter. If your meter is in the blue when you release the ball, you'll throw a standard pass, but not incredibly powerful. If your meter hits red, you'll throw an inaccurate pass that can still somehow end up in the receiver's hands. Lastly, the gold color indicates you threw a perfect pass.\n\nOverall, the system feels simple to understand and doesn't feel complex. I much prefer this passing system to Placement/Placement & Accuracy, which didn't feel right for me. Thankfully EA Sports allows you four different passing options to choose from.\n\nAnother nice thing about passing is how you can throw with more confidence. QBs can throw the ball high enough to move past defenders and land safely in the receiver's hands. This is great for those corner throws in the endzone when you have a man going deep. I used to be someone who threw mostly to slot receivers, TEs, and HBs. Now, I feel like I can throw just about anywhere if the route feels right. That's because College Football 25's Passing system feels extremely satisfying.\n\nOf course, we'd be remiss not to mention the Run game. To me, the running feels like a faster version of Madden 24. Now, if you read my Madden 24 review, you'll know that I like the running game there. In College Football 25, it feels even better.\n\nBlockers feel smarter, and make the appropriate blocks for me when needed. Running in the open field feels nice, and different moves like juking and spinning feel great. I like the differences in the speed of specific movements. An elusive HB will spin much faster than a Power back, but a Power back can get you those yards on tough situations like third and short.\n\nDefense feels a lot more creative now, thanks to the different coverage shells. With these, you can disguise what your defense is really doing and catch offenses by surprise. For example, if you want to blitz, but make it look like you're running a cover 3 shell, you can do that. But there are just a couple of slight things about defense that affected my experience.\n\nOne issue that I seemed to have was switching to other players during the play. It either took too long or never occurred at all. Furthermore, sometimes my players refused to move to the side or outright tackle on some plays. While I eventually found a play style that works for me, it took a lot longer to understand defense than it did offense. Nevertheless, defense still feels fun to play.\n\nLastly, College Football 25 introduces a new kicking system which actually feels amazing. Overall, you need to hold the A button (Xbox) or X button (PlayStation) and hit the greens on two separate meters. Although it looks complex at first, it's actually both simple and challenging enough to provide excitement. Making a game-winning field goal never felt more satisfying.\n\nThe added level of challenge feels appropriate for a college football game. After all, you're not kicking with Jake Elliott or Justin Tucker. Instead, you'll be kicking with kids who might end up pursuing a career outside of football. Therefore, expect a greater but more rewarding challenge that makes kicking more exciting than ever before.\n\nAnother thing that looks so smooth is the player animations and player movement in general. I'm seeing new kinds of tackles and new ways for players to break those tackles and it all looks really good. Of course, you can expect to see a glitchy animation here or there, but it never really compromises the experience.\n\nAnd College Football 25 does have its fair share of glitches, which is to be expected. But in my experience, these glitches seldom had any effect in-game. In fact, only once was my gameplay affected by a glitch. In a game between Middle Tennesee and Troy, my running back was ruled down a split-second after receiving the hand-off. Not sure why it happened, but it never occurred again.\n\nThe only type of glitches that do appear are just minimal visual ones. Sometimes cheerleaders or mascots appear out of thin air. Sometimes crew members on the sidelines freak out and spin like crazy. But these are mostly funny, and they make the experience more fun. Plus, I know EA Sports will release updates and patches over time to alleviate these issues.\n\nOverall, EA Sports College Football 25 delivers the best gameplay experience of any sports game out there right now. It feels fast, smooth, and extremely satisfying to experience.\n\nSo, how do the different modes of College Football 25 feel?\n\nCollege Football 25 Review - Game Modes\n\nDynasty is hands-down the best mode in the game. If you played NCAA Football 14's Dynasty, you'll feel right at home with it in CFB 25. However, although it retains many similar qualities, there's a lot more detail now throughout each phase of your coaching career.\n\nOf course, you can still start as a head coach or coordinator, and you can still upgrade your skill trees to become a greater asset to your team. And just like in NCAA Football 14, you have a dedicated amount of time to influence recruits. But it's a bit more advanced now.\n\nInstead of just spending weekly points and offering scholarships, you need to pitch players on what your school offers. Some players want to play close to home, and others want to go to a school with big NIL opportunities. You still spend points (now referred to as hours) every week researching and influencing players, but now you need to learn more about them.\n\nYou'll still see a player's top schools every week, and which school currently has the most influence. Furthermore, you can still invite them to visit your school during a bye week or game. I love the extra influence boost you receive when you invite two prospects from complementary positions. For example, I invited a Strong Safety and Free Safety to visit me on a bye week at the same time, and it helped increase my influence on them.\n\nCollege Football 25 also adds something completely new - The Transfer Portal. This brought a whole new dimension of recruiting that can help you earn highly talented players in a short amount of time. The process works similarly to the regular recruiting process, though you need to act fast if there's a player you really want.\n\nI found myself recruiting a three-star QB because I liked his Mental and Physical Abilities. But then once the Transfer Portal hit I saw QBs who made my recruit look like a nobody. I poured every resource I had into getting the signal-caller I wanted and fortunately succeeded. I'm not sure how I'll explain this to my recruit and his family. But hey - business is business.\n\nJokes aside, my favorite thing about College Football 25's Dynasty Mode is the fact that you always have something to work toward. There's always a position that needs more players. Or, you might want to coach somewhere else, so you need to build up your resume. There's so much offered that Dynasty feels like its own game alone.\n\nBut let's not forget about Road To Glory, which also returns from NCAA Football 14. Overall, this mode lets you create a player, choose from one of five different positions, and play out your collegiate career. Of course, it's a bit more complicated than that.\n\nIn CFB 25's Road to Glory mode, you'll choose from one of four journeys. You can start as a two-star recruit and rough it out, or start as a five-star prospect and receive offers from the best schools right away. This is a great detail that not only influences the difficulty of your journey but gives you control over what you want to be.\n\nWhen you create your player, you choose a position and archetype, which influences the type of player you are. I created a three-star QB and took a starting job at Kennesaw State to pad my stats before entering the Transfer Portal. But I soon found out that RTG was more than just practice and playing.\n\nEvery week, you have a limited amount of energy points to spend on your Agenda. Do you want to Study and earn the Fan Favorite Mental Ability? Or do you want to increase your Brand awareness with NIL deals? While I personally opted to be a good boy, I was tempted at times to ditch the study sessions and focus on other things.\n\nSome weeks, you'll even receive texts from teammates, advisors, coaches, and other companies who'll ask if you want to partake in activities. Some of these activities can be risky and can result in you lowering your grade or losing the trust of your coach. Others will ask if you want to spend energy points to improve certain areas of your player.\n\nBut the most important thing of all is maintaining your coach's trust in you, as well as maintaining a 2.0 GPA or higher. Your coach's trust indicates your status as a player. If it gets too low, you might lose your starting job. Conversely, you can work your way up as a backup and engage in a position battle. And keeping your grades high ensures you get to see the field every weekend.\n\nAll of these different factors made Road To Glory much more fun and detailed than I expected. But when you hit the field, things will feel more restrictive.\n\nYou have little control over your play calls in RTG. For example, my Kennesaw State QB could only call one play every time we entered the huddle. That's because your coaching staff selects the plays. Now, the more coach trust you earn, the more times you can ask for more play options. When you ask for more, the coaches provide you with up to two more plays to select.\n\nPersonally, this system worked awkwardly in my case. Sometimes, my coaches kept calling for run plays, no matter what the situation. They'd call run plays on 3rd and long, or when we were down with little time remaining. I understand my HB is a senior with a good rating, and that I'm just a freshman. However, when my HB gets 25+ carries a game, when I get 20-23 passes at most, I feel a bit underutilized.\n\nPlus, this impedes my progress as a player. I can't reach new milestones, break records, or earn player of the week awards thanks to the play-calling. I understand the decision to have a run-heavy offense. Additionally, I get that my low OVR and little experience means I won't have as many reps yet. However, I just wish the play-calling felt a little more realistic.\n\nTip: There are a few ways to work around this, though. If you call a hurry-up offense, you'll be able to audible and select from a few different plays. While you can't do it all the time, it might be useful in two-minute warning situations.\n\nAnother thing I wish RTG had was more positions. I think you should be able to play any position, no matter what it is. You can't play as a Safety or a Defensive Lineman, which are actually pretty fun positions to play with. Furthermore, TE could also be fun. But that's not the point.\n\nAdding more positions would give players more control over their RTG experience. It already feels restrictive with the limited play-calling. I know a position like DE might seem boring to some, but others would relish the opportunity to rack up 15+ sacks a year.\n\nNevertheless, I think the formula in RTG is both fun and addicting. With the right improvements, this mode could be even better in future installments. Despite some of the issues listed above, I still found it extremely enjoyable. It's a nice mode to play if you want a break from all the responsibilities Dynasty has to offer.\n\nCollege Football 25 does offer Ultimate Team, and I'll tell you in full honesty that I barely touched this mode. While I have no problem with a card-collecting mode where you can build your dream team, the execution of Ultimate Team since the beginning has been terrible. Essentially, they follow a pay-to-win structure where you spend money to receive more Player packs.\n\nWhile I think College Football 25 is incredible, the microtransactions did affect my final review score, as they do with all sports video games I've reviewed. Nevertheless, the core gameplay experience in College Football 25 is amazing. If you don't like Ultimate Team there's still way more you can do in the game to enjoy yourself.\n\nRoad To The College Football Playoff is a unique mode to College Football 25 and offers a bite-sized seasonal experience. Instead of managing rosters and recruiting new players, Road to the CFP lets you take your favorite team and head into short online matchups against other users. Apparently, with each win you earn, you face tougher opponents.\n\nI'm not sure about that, because I ended up getting my rear served to me on a silver platter starting in game one. As someone who prefers to play solo, Road to the CFP isn't a mode I see myself playing often. But for those who love the thrill and challenge of playing online, it offers a suitable experience. So there's nothing bad to say about it, and I do hope to see it return in future installments.\n\nBetween great gameplay and a solid choice of core modes, College Football 25 offers everything you could ask for.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 Review - Graphics\n\nDespite my gripes with Frostbite Engine, one thing it does well is pave the way for some charming visuals. College Football 25 is the best-looking sports video game on the market.\n\nWhat makes the game look so good is the attention to detail EA Sports put in almost every area. From stadiums to mascots, to player uniforms, almost everything looks authentic to the real game. I also like the added details of helmets updating over the season. Whether you're playing for the Buckeyes or Seminoles, you'll see an authentic visual representation of the game of College ball.\n\nAlthough it adds an extra layer of challenge, I love playing in the rain. Watching the rain slide down the players' helmets, especially on prime-time TV just feels different. For me, it adds this extra sense of pressure and weight, which makes the experience more fun. It sounds strange, but the graphics heighten the gameplay experience, or at least when it's raining.\n\nOne area though that I think could look better is snow games. To be brutally honest, the snow looks awful, and it looks like De Blob just ran all over the field (points to you if you get that reference). Jokes aside, I think it'd be nice to have more details, like player movement affecting the snow beneath them.\n\nOverall, graphics have never played a big part in my final score. Nevertheless, College Football 25 looks incredible.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 Review - Presentation\n\nThe developers didn't lie when they said that they made this game with the mindset that \"Every team is someone's favorite\". Between unique team entrances, authentic stadiums, all 134 fight songs, and much more, College Football 25 puts you in the world of collegiate football.\n\nThe attention to detail on Mascots is the first thing that caught my eye. I love watching the Minnesota Golden Gopher spin his head when his team scores. Demon Deacon looks like a total boss riding out with the players of Wake Forest. And whenever you go to Instant replay, you can see the mascots (animals or suited) watching the game from the sideline. While I hope to see more mascots join the series in future titles, I think EA picked a solid 50.\n\nAnother area where the attention to detail shines is school stadiums. The Student sections look full of energy, and I love the dedicated sections to the bands and away team. There are also tons of little details that I would've never expected EA to add, like the Blue 22-yard line at UNC. I'm really impressed with the level of detail EA put into both the accuracy and atmosphere of the stadiums.\n\nSure, you'll find some errors here and there. Not all Stadiums are 100% accurate, and there are some errors on a few uniforms and other things. But I can forgive these things because I greatly appreciate EA's effort to create an authentic game. I also understand how difficult it is to make sure that all 134 stadiums, uniforms, songs, playbooks, and more are authentic. EA Sports did a great job here.\n\nLastly, College Football 25 features over 14,000 real athletes, who you can play as in the game. While not all player models will look 100% accurate, kudos to EA for the amount of time and money they spent on securing so many players. This improves the game's presentation and helps immerse you into the world of College Football. Plus, it's a great way to learn about this year's upcoming stars, especially if you're new to college ball.\n\nHowever, I think when you're off the field, the presentation could be a bit better. Instead of just a Top Stories menu in Dynasty, it would be cool to have a weekly newspaper or even a podcast. Madden NFL 06 had the Tony Bruno Show on PS2, as well as national and local newspapers for you to read. Heck, even the newer Madden games have their weekly show dedicated to the Superstar mode.\n\nI'm not saying it ruined my experience, but I think it would go a long way to add a few more presentation elements to make the action off the field more exciting. But this is more of a nitpick, rather than a full-on critique. I think EA Sports did more than enough for their first installment in over 10 years.\n\nBut that said, I do like the cleanliness of the menus and how easy they are to navigate. Everything feels fresh and the 134 different main menu themes are a great touch. I laughed when the Temple Main menu included tickets for our 2015 victory over Penn State. I guess that was our own little National Championship.\n\nOverall, while I think the Presentation is amazing on the field, there could be a bit more done off the field to boost the presentation in modes like Dynasty and RTG. Nevertheless, College Football 25's presentation is still spectacular, and can easily be improved on in future titles.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 Review - Audio\n\nAs I mentioned, EA Sports College Football 25 features all 134 fight songs, which already deserves a lot of praise. And boy, do they sound good. You could close your eyes, and with the sound of both the band and the crowd, you'll feel like you're listening to a College Football broadcast.\n\nThe crowds are awesome. You'll hear team-specific chants and cheers, all of which hype you up. I love hearing my opponents' fans do one of their iconic chants before I upset them with a big play. And of course, you gotta love the fans giving you love when you're playing at home in a big rivalry game.\n\nAnd the inclusion of three different commentary crews keeps the experience from getting stale. Speaking of the broadcast groups, they all have extremely impressive dialogue that spans across a variety of scenarios. Throughout my experience, I heard unique comments and analyses I would never expect to hear in a sports game.\n\nThe announcers spoke in such detail that made it feel like they actually were watching my game. Of course, the more you play, the more you'll hear the same lines. But it'll take you a lot longer to get bored of this game's dialogue thanks to the expansive commentary teams. I just recommend lowering the crowd volume down if you want to hear them better. Those fans sure are loud...\n\nIn the menus, you'll hear an assortment of band drums, which all sound nice and fit the theme of the game. It's much better than Madden 24's High-hat-induced, rap-filled soundtrack. I wouldn't have minded a few featured songs, but I'm more than satisfied with the music selection in the background.\n\nOverall, College Football 25's sound and audio quality is perfect. It executes its job in immersing you in the world of College Football. You won't be disappointed in the sights and sounds come Gameday.\n\nThat wraps up all the talking points of our College Football 25 Review. So, how did the game fare?\n\nVerdict: Is EA Sports College Football 25 Worth Your Time & Money? - Review\n\nWe're only halfway through July, and EA Sports College Football 25 is already the best sports game of the year. Between its fast-paced gameplay, addicting Dynasty and Road to Glory Modes, and sweet graphical presentation, it sets the precedent for future all Football video games.\n\nEA Sports has brought College Football back to the world of gaming, and it's better than ever. I think I can safely say that NCAA Football 14's time has come. And to those who believe this game is a Madden re-skin, I encourage you to try this game out if you can. Whether it's through an EA Play trial, or if it ever shows up on PS+ or Game Pass, you should definitely see for yourself if that's really the case. I think you might be surprised.\n\nDespite running on the same engine as Madden NFL, College Football 25 feels unique and way more advanced. It proves to me that sports games can run on this engine if executed properly. EA Sports seems to have finally found a way to make me enjoy gameplay on Frostbite.\n\nThere's probably so much more I forgot to mention, like Team Builder, which just released prior to the standard edition launch. But that just goes to show how content-rich College Football 25 is. As you play the game, you'll discover something new every time to make every session memorable. As of right now, College Football 25 is the new king of sports video games.\n\nMy only minor gripes with the game came from microtransactions and minor technical issues with gameplay. However, the latter can always adjusted as EA Sports will undoubtedly patch and improve the game. But other than that, I struggle to find any major issues with the game. The gameplay is just too fun, and it alone more than counters any negatives.\n\nThe real challenge for EA Sports now will be to create new innovations that will keep the College Football series from getting stale. But for now, I think the developers deserve to celebrate for a job well done. The base formula is there, and now it's just time to continue to improve and grow without fixing what isn't broken.\n\nI think if you loved the NCAA Football games, you'll be right at home with College Football 25. I think it's definitely worth picking up, especially if some of the modes and features mentioned above excite you. College Football is back baby. For those who never stopped believing, you have been rewarded with one of the best sports games ever made.\n\nScore: 9.5/10\n\nThat wraps up our College Football 25 Review. Keep checking back with us for more guides, roster updates, and more throughout the season. We hope you enjoy CFB 25!\n\nEditor's Note: ClutchPoints received a PS5 review copy to allow us to cover this game.

The company froze future editions in 2013 when athletes began questioning why they weren't getting paid to be featured in the games.\n\nWith athlete compensation rights sorted out in court and now allowed by the NCAA, EA Sports announced in 2021 it would be reviving the franchise. The video-game developer offered Bowl Subdivision players a minimum of $600 and a copy of the game to have their likeness included in it. More than 11,000 players accepted offers.\n\nEA Sports has said its goal for the game was \"to feel like a love letter to college football and its fans.\"\n\nSan Diego State and Colorado were among the schools hosting College Football 25 events this week. Across social platforms, athletes such as LeBron James, Tim Tebow and Michael Vick -- even comedians Shane Gillis and Dan Soder -- were live-streaming head-to-head matches in the game.\n\nMichigan running back Donovan Edwards, one of the cover athletes, said in May some of the best moments of his childhood involved playing EA Sports college football with his best friend.\n\n\"Just for it to be back, as well as to be on the cover of it, it's an awesome feeling,\" he said.\n\nThe game's other standard-edition cover athletes are Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers and Colorado two-way player Travis Hunter. The deluxe edition features the backs of numerous players in a stadium tunnel, including Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe, Georgia quarterback Carson Beck and Ohio State running back Quinshon Judkins.\n\nEA Sports' college football franchise dates to the 1990s. It grew in popularity in the early 2000s as gaming systems became more advanced, allowing for revolutionary game modes such as the popular Race for the Heisman create-a-player that was introduced in NCAA Football 06.\n\nThat edition also featured historic teams, including the 1992 Alabama squad that Clemson coach Dabo Swinney played on.\n\n\"Sleeping on me a little bit,\" Swinney joked about the 70 overall rating for his player, \"WR No. 88,\" which did, however, have a 91 speed rating. \"They must have my going down the Hill speed. I appreciate the love they gave me on that.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Pete Iacobelli contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football.

No. No. No. No. No. But for dedicated college football fans, the wait was even longer.\n\nBefore this week, Electronic Arts' most recent college football video game -- \"NCAA Football 14\" -- had been released on July 9, 2013. The series was then waylaid by legal disputes surrounding player likenesses, pitched into an 11-year purgatory while the sport painstakingly evolved.\n\nOf course, college athletes were finally permitted to be paid for utilizing their name, image and likeness (NIL) in 2021, which allowed EA to compensate the players it profits from. (Players who opted in received $600 ... and, of course, a copy of the game.)\n\nPeople are also reading...

Clark, a devotee of the series and NHL writer for ESPN.com, told The Seattle Times on Monday.\n\nIt's a holiday steeped in nostalgia -- in midsummer marathons on prehistoric PlayStations, in triple-option offenses and players lost to time, in critical recruiting battles for fictional five-star safeties, in regional conferences (remember them?) and in-state rivalries.\n\n\"NCAA Football 14\" had 20 predecessors, dating to \"Bill Walsh College Football\" in 1993. It also had a frenzied following, a generation of football fans who developed dynasties -- chiseling national champions out of small-school Cinderellas.\n\n\"For me it was really cool, because I got to see really good teams and players that in 1998, in Minneapolis, I wasn't ever going to see play until the bowl game,\" said Dave Southorn, 42, who later covered Boise State football for The Idaho Statesman and The Athletic. \"You got this really good view of the college football landscape through that game.\n\n\"That really helped me, to be frank, as I was figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I was like, 'Oh, this is cool.' I knew things that others didn't. Everyone was talking about Michigan or whoever. I was like, 'Have you heard of Tulane?' \"\n\nClark, likewise, celebrated the annual summer release with a weeklong marathon, as he and a friend staged a sport-wide tournament (modeled after the UEFA Champions League in European soccer) to establish supremacy.\n\n\"We did our own statistical tracking [of games],\" said Clark, 39, who traces the tournament to his high-school years in Florida from 1998 to 2002. \"We were absolute nerds about it, and we totally own it. We absolutely own it.\"\n\nConcluded Clark, who lives in Seattle: \"This is what we would do from 4 o'clock in the afternoon to 2 o'clock in the morning every day for a week.\"\n\nDecades later, the arrival of \"EA Sports College Football 25\" has attracted a similar response, flooding social-media feeds with flea flickers and stadium shots and shaking student sections. As 247Sports college football reporter and podcaster Bud Elliott posted Tuesday on X: \"The EA Sports College Football release has completely upstaged media days buzz. Search trends [online] are wild. To the point where talking college football on a college football show instead of talking about the video game is legit bad business.\"\n\nThe business of college football is also reflected in the game, as players must maneuver NIL deals and the transfer portal to retain top talent. An athlete's academics, leadership skills, health, training and brand all must be monitored.\n\nIndeed, a whole lot happened in the 4,025 days between the releases of \"NCAA Football 14\" and \"EA Sports College Football 25.\"\n\nFor the sport, the franchise ... and its fans.\n\n\"The last time this game came out, I wasn't yet engaged,\" Southorn said. \"I've been married for nine years now. That's how long it's been for me.\"\n\nJoked Clark on Monday morning, in a similar situation: \"When 1 o'clock rolls around, my wife understands that it was a great run for our marriage. We had a lot of great years. We put championships in the rafters. But I'm a ghost to her now, and she knows that, God bless her.\"\n\nSouthorn may soon count among the game-playing ghosts. The University of Colorado alum, who now handles content and communications for a hospital system in Idaho, requested off work Friday to reignite a former flame.\n\n\"Daycare is going to come in clutch,\" said the 42-year-old father and Carnation native. \"I'll get up, take [daughter Kennedy] to day care in the morning. Maybe I'll swing by the doughnut shop and grab something, and then just settle in. I'll probably order a pizza or something at lunch, because I don't want to move.\n\n\"I know I'm in a boat with a whole lot of people. When you get to 40ish and you've got kids, you don't have as much time. But I know I'm literally going to find ways to make time. Because we all need something.\"\n\nThis game, for some, is more than a silly aside -- or a time machine to a tournament lasting until 2 a.m. It's not just nostalgia wrapped in new graphics and updated uniforms.\n\nIt's also a referendum on college football's deepening divide, on the parity diluted by super conferences and media-rights money. It's an individual objection -- a place where Army and Akron and Appalachian State can overwhelm Alabama, where Washington State can pummel its former Pac-12 partners into apologetic pieces.\n\nIt's a place where former Notre Dame and Wake Forest quarterback Sam Hartman -- whose Demon Deacons never defeated Clemson in his five seasons as the starter -- can topple the Tigers, 105-34, as they did Tuesday.\n\n\"Just blowing off some steam...\" Hartman posted, along with a screen shot, on social media.\n\nIt's a place where anything is still possible, provided you can play.\n\n\"I think maybe in the back of our lizard brains, you have some control over it now. You can make the Cinderella story happen,\" Southorn said. \"You can build someone up, where realistically it probably wouldn't happen [in the current era of college football] because of NIL and conference affiliation. You can return it to the way it used to be and feel like college football is a little more even or fair. I think that's a big part of it.\"\n\n0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site

Fans can customize every detail of their team, from logos to players, with flexibility and creativity. Early graduation in Road to Glory mode can save players a year of playthrough time in the game.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 Team Builder feature is now officially accessible, contrary to previous reports that it would not be available at launch. As early copies of the game have begun to circulate, fans have been taking their time exploring every mode that they are able to play. While some of the features are currently experiencing problems, such as the Lorem Ipsum Error in EA Sports College Football 25's Dynasty Mode, fans are hopeful that the day-one patch would fix issues and allow access to other missing modes.\n\nEarly rumors stated that the Team Builder feature would not be available once EA Sports College Football 25 launches on July 19. This was previously confirmed by a previous statement by EA wherein it was stated that news about the mode would come out soon after. However, it seems EA has been able to get the feature running and also updated its deep dive report regarding the mode.\n\nRelated\n\nHow to Graduate Early in College Football 25's Road to Glory Mode\n\nIt's possible for players to shave an entire year off of their Road to Glory playthrough by graduating early in EA Sports College Football 25.\n\nAccording to the EA website, EA Sports College Football 25's Team Builder is available for use via web browser access. The use of Team Builder requires the use of the EA Account to log in to the website. Once logged in, the process begins by creating an identity, and all the basics that come with it. Elements such as names, nicknames, logos, uniforms, and others, are just some of those that the player can customize. The detail of customization is so flexible that fans who wish to fix the Stanford logo issue in College Football 25 can just do it themselves, especially with 7 layers being available for custom logos.\n\nClose\n\nWhat Else Can Fans Do After Editing The Team's Basic Information?\n\nWhile EA has previously reported that EA Sports College Football 25 features realistic environments that were recreated with accuracy and attention to detail, players may also choose to build their own. From the Stadium, Crowd, Surface, Endzones, Logos, and all the little things, fans have the option to make everything feel unique. Players can choose from the 134 available existing stadiums and then customize even further to match the custom team's look and feel.\n\nAs for the playbooks and players, there are 7 available generic roster types to choose from. While it wasn't stated whether fans would be able to take from any of College Football 25's existing rosters, the existing choices may provide a wealthy range of options for players to base their custom team on. The report has stated that fans can change their players' heights, weights, and statistics.\n\nOnce done, players will be able to publish and download the finished team in-game. However, a small note to remember is that those who wish to use the custom team in Dynasty will only be able to do it in a private cloud Dynasty. Furthermore, only 16 teams will be available to import, and only the commissioner will be able to do so. Still, the options provided are very flexible, which means that the custom options available will open up the creative side of many fans of the game.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25\n\nThe first entry in EA's series since 2013's NCAA Football 14, EA Sports College Football 25 is a sports sim that focuses on realistically capturing the college football scene.\n\nFranchise EA Sports College Football\n\nSystem PlayStation , Xbox\n\nPlatform(s) PS5 , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased July 19, 2024\n\nDeveloper(s) EA Orlando", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miguel_luis_llado@gamerant.com", "name": "Miguel Luis Llado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_25", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL 25"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ea-sports-college-football-25-cover.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 1050, "textEnd": 1057}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 3914, "textEnd": 3921}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

It grew in popularity in the early 2000s as gaming systems became more advanced, allowing for revolutionary game modes such as the popular Race for the Heisman create-a-player that was introduced in NCAA Football 06.\n\nThat edition also featured historic teams, including the 1992 Alabama squad that Clemson coach Dabo Swinney played on.\n\n\"Sleeping on me a little bit,\" Swinney joked about the 70 overall rating for his player, \"WR No. 88,\" which did, however, have a 91 speed rating. \"They must have my going down the Hill speed. I appreciate the love they gave me on that.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Pete Iacobelli contributed to this report.\n\nAP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football.

The pageantry and speed of gameplay make for a stellar experience. Unfortunately, hangovers from EA's other sports titles keep the title from achieving greatness.\n\nEA's former college football franchise, NCAA Football, quickly became a sporting staple. They were then unceremoniously forced to cease production of the series in 2013. Due to an inability to compensate college athletes for their likeness, the series was shelved - that is, until now.\n\nCollege Football 25 is not the same game that players fell in love with ten years ago. A decade has passed, and EA - along with the gaming industry - has changed in that time. However, this title flies its college colors proudly, and through its saturated lens, we can experience one of the most enjoyable sports titles in years.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 simulates the reality of life as a college athlete with boisterousness and camaraderie. Unfortunately, the game is weighed down by EA's pseudo-patented anti-consumer practices and lack of entry-level mechanics.\n\nGraphical improvements and reimagined game mechanics aside, EA College Football 25 just plays faster than its big brother Madden.\n\nThis increased speed is not just apparent in the load times and twitch decision-making of a quarterback but in the gameplay itself. It may seem less grounded, and more like an arcade title, but that's just skimming the surface.\n\nThe increased pace is most enjoyed in the frequent - in some instances, somewhat unfair - matchups. With this relationship, you are left with an experience that is unashamedly college football. The Madden NFL series never felt gritty and heavy. However, comparing Madden 24 to EA Sports College Football 25 is like comparing EA FC 24 to Fifa Street.\n\nIf the thumping big band performances of 'Welcome to the Jungle', spinning cheerleaders, and anthropomorphic mascots didn't turn you on to EA Sports College Football 25's commitment to the college experience, then nothing will.\n\nVisuals on the pitch are generally stellar, indicating a dynamic leap from EA's last football title. The crashing of bodies and dynamic camera angles pull you into the experience.\n\nHowever, EA Tiburon has seemingly forgotten about updating the crowds from the last college football title in 2013. The crowd, past the incredibly dynamic and colorful front row, are Max Payne-esc stand-ins. This is made worse when multiple doppelgangers are standing row after row behind and beside them.\n\nArguably more important, however, is how the game plays. In that regard, EA Sports College Football 25 takes the ball and pelts it upfield. Gameplay on the gridiron is fluid and dynamic, if a little too sensitive. An overarching complaint of College Football 25 has been its passing mechanic.\n\nThis has seen a diversion from a button press to a gauge that fills until you release the button. This altered passing can be switched for a replica of the streamlined previous system. However, the more I played EA Sports College Football 25, the more I got used to it. It got to a point where I was connecting hail-mary passes I could have only dreamed about before.\n\nCall it a learning curve, or call it Stockholm syndrome. At least EA is self-aware enough to give players the ability to toggle it off.\n\nEA College Football 24 is a title with a lot of systems, and that's not a bad thing. Yet, with so many intricate systems at play - and with some gamers coming into this console generation purely to pick the title up - it needs a much more rounded tutorial system.\n\nThere is a vast selection of Minigames to give the illusion of an entry-level experience. However, the true tutorial is hidden in the crevices of the College Ultimate Team mode. This feels like a somewhat shady-looking decision, considering it's the only mode that funnels players into the microtransaction pipeline.\n\nEA College Football 25 isn't just another football video game, in line with its gargantuan Madden NFL-shaped sibling. With its return to the gaming space, Electronic Arts has broadcast its commitment to the college football experience. The perils of student multitasking are all brought forth in its Road to Glory game mode, from maintaining a decent GPA, and interacting with other students, to actively keeping up with your training.\n\nUnlike previous entries in the series, you immediately start in your college bracket. This is instead of transitioning from a high school position as fans of the series previously enjoyed. This does leave a much-loved mechanic on the cutting-room floor. However, it does allow gamers to get right in on the meat of the mode.\n\nWhile you can start as a five-star player, jumping straight onto the field, you can alter this to varying degrees. Beginning as a two-star recruit, for example, you have to climb the ranks of your college team. You do this by earning the trust of your coach and teammates while maintaining that aforementioned GPA and social credo.\n\nThese elements are gamified through the use of systems similar to a role-playing game scattered between every game. The visual novel-like texting and social media sections don't have the same depth as something like Persona. Yet, they lend to one of the most engaging systems of the title.\n\nDynasty, on the other hand, is EA College Football's return to a Football Manager-esc team-building mode. You begin your journey by entering the ranks of one of the 134 FBS schools in the game's roster.\n\nYou are given a similar amount of control as to whether you jump right into its systems, or allow for a more gradual introduction. Gamers can choose to enter campus as a new Head Coach, or one of its offensive/defensive coordinators.\n\nWhen entering the ring of college football management, you can choose what kind of coach you want to be. The three archetypes for your coach are; Motivator, Tactician, and Recruiter. They all give select improvements in certain areas of your performance, similar to the abilities of your players.\n\nThe mode's return has been met with nigh universal acclaim. However, the days of sidling up to the best-rated student-athletes to create an unstoppable superteam are over.\n\nTime and resource management are integral to the mode. Other colleges are consistently challenging your moves to secure the most sought-after new talent.\n\nThroughout the season, you are not only tasked with scouting for new talent but maintaining and retaining your current squad. Insofar as the games themselves, you can - of course - simulate the entire affair to focus on the big-picture planning. Beyond that, you can play select sections of your team's game. You can choose to control your team all game, on the offense, on the defense, or even opt to just 'play the moments'.\n\nHere it comes - it wouldn't be an EA Sports title without it. EA Sports College Football 25 entices players to its Ultimate Team mode with the promise of creative freedom at the core of its most competitive mode.\n\nThe mode will most likely receive much of EA's post-launch support for College Football 25. Ultimate Team has been a staple of Electronic Arts' sports titles since its inception. Ironically, it is this most modern addition - beyond all of College Football 25's ways to play - that feels the most redundant.\n\nThe creation and promotion of Dynasty and Road to Glory wouldn't severely impact Ultimate Team's appeal on the surface. However, EA Tiburon has done such a tremendous job of bolstering their alternative single-player systems. As such, Ultimate Team feels less like a culmination of everything great in College Football 25, and more like the skeezy multiplayer mode they were obliged to force in.\n\nThat's not to say that players won't find an immense amount of enjoyment from Ultimate Team. From its interlocking systems to its customizable team roster and aesthetic. It's just that so many of the elements that make Ultimate Team so enjoyable have been peppered into College Football 25's alternate modes. As such, Ultimate Team's already weaning appeal to some has decreased all the more.\n\nAlthough Ultimate Team may somewhat hog the spotlight, EA College Football 25's newest competitive multiplayer mode lies deeper in the menus. Road to the CFP tasks players with online matchups within three-minute bouts. These matches are meant to simulate that of a real-life college football season.\n\nAs your team slowly climbs the ranks, through tiered cups, you reach ever and ever closer to a place in the College Football Playoffs. This also brings you ever closer to your chance to pick up the fabled Heisman Trophy!\n\nWhile Road to the CFP is a concrete mode, it is a section of EA College Football 25 that thrives on a booming online community to butt heads with on your way to get the gold. Even with the immense amount of early adopters, it isn't a mode that has been stress-tested like it profusely deserves.\n\nIts core is solid, and its goal is evident. However, with the almost excessive amount of content in the title, it is an overwhelmingly enjoyable distraction. Sadly, however, one which many players may sidestep to get to either of the two other single-player modes, or Ultimate Team.\n\nEA College Football 25 is a title many players will most likely enjoy an ecstatic honeymoon period with, after such a long time out of gamers' hands. However, the title could have been spent a little longer on the bench before joining the starting lineup. This would allow the User Interface and User Experience to be tweaked and amended. Beyond that, NPC college football fans could have been heavily polished in the stands.\n\nYet, even with the immense weight of its legacy on its shoulders, EA College Football delivers on every single one of its promises - and then some. The college atmosphere - with streamers, mascots, and cheerleaders - is concentrated into a pseudo-arcade style football title which can be enjoyed by football fanatics and casual fans alike.\n\nEA isn't renowned for presenting gamers with full-priced sports titles that are worth the money. However, their return to college football leaves this title bursting at the seams. While EA couldn't help but underhand returning fans of the series with Ultimate Team, they provide more than enough alternatives for those who wish to leave the mode on the bench.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25, at its heart, is incredibly unique in a modern sports game setting. As such, it holds its school colors high and proud - although, it's going to be a big undertaking to keep up with nearly 140 different team rosters post-launch.\n\nHowever, in comparing it to its NFL counterpart, some seriously impressive changes will hopefully be retrofitted into the 'big brother' series when we see it launch later this year.", "source": {"uri": "twinfinite.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twinfinite"}, "authors": [{"uri": "connor_wright@twinfinite.net", "name": "Connor Wright", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grading in education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Tiburon", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EA Tiburon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelg\u00e4nger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doppelg\u00e4nger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arcade game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthropomorphism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mechanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_band", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Bowl_Subdivision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic_Study", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic Study", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://twinfinite.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EA_Sports_College_Football_25_Mascot.png?fit=1200%2C685", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

No. No. No. No. No. But for dedicated college football fans, the wait was even longer.\n\nBefore this week, Electronic Arts' most recent college football video game -- \"NCAA Football 14\" -- had been released on July 9, 2013. The series was then waylaid by legal disputes surrounding player likenesses, pitched into an 11-year purgatory while the sport painstakingly evolved.\n\nOf course, college athletes were finally permitted to be paid for utilizing their name, image and likeness (NIL) in 2021, which allowed EA to compensate the players it profits from. (Players who opted in received $600 ... and, of course, a copy of the game.)\n\nPeople are also reading... $400K in unpaid bills for grapes lead to slew of lawsuits against Napa winemaker Ryan Seacrest's Napa County home up for sale at $22 million Customers are raving about Moulin -- downtown Napa's new caf\u00e9 and bakery Hank McGraw, onetime baseball phenom turned maverick and late-life Napan, dead at 81 Letter: Concerns about St. Helena Agritourism Initiative Mount Veeder vineyard owners sue own lawyers over money tied to Tubbs Fire Napa City Council to weigh selling land for downtown development Napa High School Athletic Hall of Fame: Cabral learned from sports how to battle adversity in life Fight between Le Petit Elephant and Alta Heights neighbors gets personal Why is that?

Clark, a devotee of the series and NHL writer for ESPN.com, told The Seattle Times on Monday.\n\nIt's a holiday steeped in nostalgia -- in midsummer marathons on prehistoric PlayStations, in triple-option offenses and players lost to time, in critical recruiting battles for fictional five-star safeties, in regional conferences (remember them?) and in-state rivalries.\n\n\"NCAA Football 14\" had 20 predecessors, dating to \"Bill Walsh College Football\" in 1993. It also had a frenzied following, a generation of football fans who developed dynasties -- chiseling national champions out of small-school Cinderellas.\n\n\"For me it was really cool, because I got to see really good teams and players that in 1998, in Minneapolis, I wasn't ever going to see play until the bowl game,\" said Dave Southorn, 42, who later covered Boise State football for The Idaho Statesman and The Athletic. \"You got this really good view of the college football landscape through that game.\n\n\"That really helped me, to be frank, as I was figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I was like, 'Oh, this is cool.' I knew things that others didn't. Everyone was talking about Michigan or whoever. I was like, 'Have you heard of Tulane?' \"\n\nClark, likewise, celebrated the annual summer release with a weeklong marathon, as he and a friend staged a sport-wide tournament (modeled after the UEFA Champions League in European soccer) to establish supremacy.\n\n\"We did our own statistical tracking [of games],\" said Clark, 39, who traces the tournament to his high-school years in Florida from 1998 to 2002. \"We were absolute nerds about it, and we totally own it. We absolutely own it.\"\n\nConcluded Clark, who lives in Seattle: \"This is what we would do from 4 o'clock in the afternoon to 2 o'clock in the morning every day for a week.\"\n\nDecades later, the arrival of \"EA Sports College Football 25\" has attracted a similar response, flooding social-media feeds with flea flickers and stadium shots and shaking student sections. As 247Sports college football reporter and podcaster Bud Elliott posted Tuesday on X: \"The EA Sports College Football release has completely upstaged media days buzz. Search trends [online] are wild. To the point where talking college football on a college football show instead of talking about the video game is legit bad business.\"\n\nThe business of college football is also reflected in the game, as players must maneuver NIL deals and the transfer portal to retain top talent. An athlete's academics, leadership skills, health, training and brand all must be monitored.\n\nIndeed, a whole lot happened in the 4,025 days between the releases of \"NCAA Football 14\" and \"EA Sports College Football 25.\"\n\nFor the sport, the franchise ... and its fans.\n\n\"The last time this game came out, I wasn't yet engaged,\" Southorn said. \"I've been married for nine years now. That's how long it's been for me.\"\n\nJoked Clark on Monday morning, in a similar situation: \"When 1 o'clock rolls around, my wife understands that it was a great run for our marriage. We had a lot of great years. We put championships in the rafters. But I'm a ghost to her now, and she knows that, God bless her.\"\n\nSouthorn may soon count among the game-playing ghosts. The University of Colorado alum, who now handles content and communications for a hospital system in Idaho, requested off work Friday to reignite a former flame.\n\n\"Daycare is going to come in clutch,\" said the 42-year-old father and Carnation native. \"I'll get up, take [daughter Kennedy] to day care in the morning. Maybe I'll swing by the doughnut shop and grab something, and then just settle in. I'll probably order a pizza or something at lunch, because I don't want to move.\n\n\"I know I'm in a boat with a whole lot of people. When you get to 40ish and you've got kids, you don't have as much time. But I know I'm literally going to find ways to make time. Because we all need something.\"\n\nThis game, for some, is more than a silly aside -- or a time machine to a tournament lasting until 2 a.m. It's not just nostalgia wrapped in new graphics and updated uniforms.\n\nIt's also a referendum on college football's deepening divide, on the parity diluted by super conferences and media-rights money. It's an individual objection -- a place where Army and Akron and Appalachian State can overwhelm Alabama, where Washington State can pummel its former Pac-12 partners into apologetic pieces.\n\nIt's a place where former Notre Dame and Wake Forest quarterback Sam Hartman -- whose Demon Deacons never defeated Clemson in his five seasons as the starter -- can topple the Tigers, 105-34, as they did Tuesday.\n\n\"Just blowing off some steam...\" Hartman posted, along with a screen shot, on social media.\n\nIt's a place where anything is still possible, provided you can play.\n\n\"I think maybe in the back of our lizard brains, you have some control over it now. You can make the Cinderella story happen,\" Southorn said. \"You can build someone up, where realistically it probably wouldn't happen [in the current era of college football] because of NIL and conference affiliation. You can return it to the way it used to be and feel like college football is a little more even or fair. I think that's a big part of it.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "napavalleyregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Napa Valley Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_vorel@napavalleyregister.com", "name": "Mike Vorel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Napa County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Napa County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Seacrest", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Seacrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seattle_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Seattle Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Helena,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Helena, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Helena, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubbs_Fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tubbs Fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Napa High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Electronic Arts revealed that there were 2.2 million unique players during this period. The figure is separate from the 600,000 players who accessed the trial via EA Play, resulting in a whopping 2.8 million players.\n\nIt's a strong start, especially considering the last title in the franchise (NCAA Football 14) launched over 11 years ago. SVP and group GM for EA Sports Daryl Holt said, \"From the moment we decided to make EA Sports College Football 25, the passionate college football fans were our team's north star. This game is for the fans, and the response we've seen from across the collegiate landscape, athletes, creators, celebrities and the core community has been nothing short of spectacular.\n\n\"Every team is someone's favorite, and College Football 25 is a testament to the passion and dedication of our developers to build the most authentic college football experience possible for our fans.

Everyone else who didn't throw down this extra $30 has been patiently waiting for Friday, July 19th, when the football sim will formally begin hitting store shelves. To that end, if you're wondering when College Football 25 will finally be available to play, here's what you need to know.\n\nCollege Football 25 Release Time\n\nIn old-school fashion, EA Sports College Football 25 won't become available until midnight. What's different about this launch, though, is that midnight is specifically based on the EDT time zone. Rather than releasing the game at midnight in each time zone across the United States (and the rest of the world), it will instead unlock across all regions at this time. This means that for those in the U.S., it will become playable at 12:00 am EDT, 11:00 pm CDT, and 9:00 pm PDT.\n\nIf you're looking to have the game ready to go at this instantaneous moment, EA Sports has allowed pre-downloads for College Football 25 across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. This means that if you've pre-ordered the game digitally already, you can start downloading it to your console of choice at the time of this writing. And if you haven't already bought it, you might want to look to do so sooner rather than later.\n\nWill College Football 25's Servers Crash?\n\nOne big fear that the College Football 25 community has is that the game's servers might struggle upon its release. This is something that has already been seen throughout this week as College Football 25 has seemingly drawn in millions of players in its early access phase alone. As a result, EA Sports has had some difficulties with the servers as so many are looking to play the game at once.\n\nWith this in mind, there's a chance that these issues might become amplified further with so many others now playing College Football 25 after its standard edition launch. If you find yourself met with any errors throughout this weekend, it's likely to be expected.

The company froze future editions in 2013 when athletes began questioning why they weren't getting paid to be featured in the games.\n\nWith athlete compensation rights sorted out in court and now allowed by the NCAA, EA Sports announced in 2021 it would be reviving the franchise. The video-game developer offered Bowl Subdivision players a minimum of $600 and a copy of the game to have their likeness included in it. More than 11,000 players accepted offers.\n\nEA Sports has said its goal for the game was \"to feel like a love letter to college football and its fans.\"\n\nSan Diego State and Colorado were among the schools hosting College Football 25 events this week. Across social platforms, athletes such as LeBron James, Tim Tebow and Michael Vick -- even comedians Shane Gillis and Dan Soder -- were live-streaming head-to-head matches in the game.\n\nMichigan running back Donovan Edwards, one of the cover athletes, said in May some of the best moments of his childhood involved playing EA Sports college football with his best friend.\n\n\"Just for it to be back, as well as to be on the cover of it, it's an awesome feeling,\" he said.\n\nThe game's other standard-edition cover athletes are Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers and Colorado two-way player Travis Hunter. The deluxe edition features the backs of numerous players in a stadium tunnel, including Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe, Georgia quarterback Carson Beck and Ohio State running back Quinshon Judkins.\n\nEA Sports' college football franchise dates to the 1990s. It grew in popularity in the early 2000s as gaming systems became more advanced, allowing for revolutionary game modes such as the popular Race for the Heisman create-a-player that was introduced in NCAA Football 06.\n\nThat edition also featured historic teams, including the 1992 Alabama squad that Clemson coach Dabo Swinney played on.\n\n\"Sleeping on me a little bit,\" Swinney joked about the 70 overall rating for his player, \"WR No. 88,\" which did, however, have a 91 speed rating. \"They must have my going down the Hill speed. I appreciate the love they gave me on that.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Pete Iacobelli contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [],

FC (formerly FIFA) and Madden games are bestsellers every year, but they also have dreadful user reviews on sites like Metacritic. That's due to light, incremental changes year-over-year, a lack of crucial mechanics for sports simulators, and lots of bugs. That rocky reputation made EA's impending return to college football equal parts exciting and scary ahead of its release. Would EA Sports College Football 25 be the grand return of the series after a decade of dormancy or a disastrous return?\n\nThankfully, I can confirm that EA Sports College Football 25 is the best EA Sports game that I've played in years. It takes the solid core of Madden's football gameplay, but actually builds on that in a couple of key ways. Its presentation feels much more lively and polished than other EA Sports games, and its modes bring a lot of welcome depth and customization options that have been sorely lacking in other EA Sports offerings. While there are still a couple of quirks to be ironed out, this is the first EA Sports game I've felt comfortable recommending at full price in a long time.\n\nRecommended Videos Taking the field again\n\nUnlike this year's Top Spin 2K25 (which somehow still felt like a minor improvement over its predecessor despite the decade-long gap between them), College Football 25 feels like a big step up for the college football franchise. It's now running on the Frostbite Engine like Madden and FC do, and because this is a current-gen exclusive, it's one of the best-looking sports games out there. EA upped the production value of the presentation around the game too, with highly detailed stadiums, cheerleaders, mascots, referees, and more.\n\nThose kinds of presentation flourishes were something that has felt lacking from even recent Madden games, giving College Football 25 an edge over its NFL-focused counterpart. On Xbox Series X, there are occasional frame rate issues when transitioning from replays to gameplay, and some players are running into online connectivity issues. Personally, I haven't run into nearly as many glitches in College Football 25 as I have in recent Madden games.\n\nPrime Day Focus These Razer Blade Prime Day deals really pack a punch [in gaming power] Secretlab Prime Day deals: Build your ideal work-from-home or gaming station Amazfit Amazon Prime Day deals dropped: Save up to 40% off smartwatches today Send it! This HoverAir X1 Drone can capture your adventures and it's $120 off\n\nYou might just consider a well-presented and not bug-filled EA Sports game the bare minimum. If that's the case, then you'll be happy to hear that College Football 25 backs it up with solid gameplay and modes. Moment-to-moment football feels similar to Madden, although I enjoy this game's unique tweaks to passing and kicking controls. Interestingly, EA's football gameplay style also inadvertently feels a bit better for college football than professional football because of its fast pace and focus on explosive plays.\n\nWhen it comes to modes, College Football 25 features the typical Play Now and Ultimate Team ones, but really shines in Road to Glory and Dynasty. Road to Glory is its athlete-specific mode clearly inspired by Road to the Show from Sony's MLB The Show. Players choose a position, fight to become a starter on the college team of their choice, and then must perform well in football games to keep their spot. Between games, players also have to manage spending energy on things like school to ensure they can keep players and improve their skills by using points gained via level-up.\n\nPlaying as a quarterback at my alma mater in College Football 25 is really where I gained my appreciation for its presentation and gameplay improvements. Fans of franchise modes in sports games will probably want to pay more attention to Dynasty mode, where players control a team as head coach, offensive coordinator, and defensive coordinator. In Dynasty, I appreciate College Football 25's wear-and-tear system, which makes dealing with player health and injuries a more involved process over the course of the season. I also love that I can customize the conferences to my liking, something that's impossible to do in Madden.\n\nScouting high school players in Dynasty feels even more involved and captivating than scouting players in Madden because a lot of effort is required to convince prospective players that you're one of their top schools. Hopefully, the creative spark and innovations in College Football 25 will trickle down into Madden NFL 25 and future EA football games. This is the most refreshed I've felt playing an EA Sports game in years, and I hope EA learns the right lessons if this game is successful and improves its whole sports game lineup.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 launches for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on July 19.

No. No. No. No. No. But for dedicated college football fans, the wait was even longer.\n\nBefore this week, Electronic Arts' most recent college football video game -- \"NCAA Football 14\" -- had been released on July 9, 2013. The series was then waylaid by legal disputes surrounding player likenesses, pitched into an 11-year purgatory while the sport painstakingly evolved.\n\nOf course, college athletes were finally permitted to be paid for utilizing their name, image and likeness (NIL) in 2021, which allowed EA to compensate the players it profits from. (Players who opted in received $600 ... and, of course, a copy of the game.)\n\nPeople are also reading...

Clark, a devotee of the series and NHL writer for ESPN.com, told The Seattle Times on Monday.\n\nIt's a holiday steeped in nostalgia -- in midsummer marathons on prehistoric PlayStations, in triple-option offenses and players lost to time, in critical recruiting battles for fictional five-star safeties, in regional conferences (remember them?) and in-state rivalries.\n\n\"NCAA Football 14\" had 20 predecessors, dating to \"Bill Walsh College Football\" in 1993. It also had a frenzied following, a generation of football fans who developed dynasties -- chiseling national champions out of small-school Cinderellas.\n\n\"For me it was really cool, because I got to see really good teams and players that in 1998, in Minneapolis, I wasn't ever going to see play until the bowl game,\" said Dave Southorn, 42, who later covered Boise State football for The Idaho Statesman and The Athletic. \"You got this really good view of the college football landscape through that game.\n\n\"That really helped me, to be frank, as I was figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I was like, 'Oh, this is cool.' I knew things that others didn't. Everyone was talking about Michigan or whoever. I was like, 'Have you heard of Tulane?' \"\n\nClark, likewise, celebrated the annual summer release with a weeklong marathon, as he and a friend staged a sport-wide tournament (modeled after the UEFA Champions League in European soccer) to establish supremacy.\n\n\"We did our own statistical tracking [of games],\" said Clark, 39, who traces the tournament to his high-school years in Florida from 1998 to 2002. \"We were absolute nerds about it, and we totally own it. We absolutely own it.\"\n\nConcluded Clark, who lives in Seattle: \"This is what we would do from 4 o'clock in the afternoon to 2 o'clock in the morning every day for a week.\"\n\nDecades later, the arrival of \"EA Sports College Football 25\" has attracted a similar response, flooding social-media feeds with flea flickers and stadium shots and shaking student sections. As 247Sports college football reporter and podcaster Bud Elliott posted Tuesday on X: \"The EA Sports College Football release has completely upstaged media days buzz. Search trends [online] are wild. To the point where talking college football on a college football show instead of talking about the video game is legit bad business.\"\n\nThe business of college football is also reflected in the game, as players must maneuver NIL deals and the transfer portal to retain top talent. An athlete's academics, leadership skills, health, training and brand all must be monitored.\n\nIndeed, a whole lot happened in the 4,025 days between the releases of \"NCAA Football 14\" and \"EA Sports College Football 25.\"\n\nFor the sport, the franchise ... and its fans.\n\n\"The last time this game came out, I wasn't yet engaged,\" Southorn said. \"I've been married for nine years now. That's how long it's been for me.\"\n\nJoked Clark on Monday morning, in a similar situation: \"When 1 o'clock rolls around, my wife understands that it was a great run for our marriage. We had a lot of great years. We put championships in the rafters. But I'm a ghost to her now, and she knows that, God bless her.\"\n\nSouthorn may soon count among the game-playing ghosts. The University of Colorado alum, who now handles content and communications for a hospital system in Idaho, requested off work Friday to reignite a former flame.\n\n\"Daycare is going to come in clutch,\" said the 42-year-old father and Carnation native. \"I'll get up, take [daughter Kennedy] to day care in the morning. Maybe I'll swing by the doughnut shop and grab something, and then just settle in. I'll probably order a pizza or something at lunch, because I don't want to move.\n\n\"I know I'm in a boat with a whole lot of people. When you get to 40ish and you've got kids, you don't have as much time. But I know I'm literally going to find ways to make time. Because we all need something.\"\n\nThis game, for some, is more than a silly aside -- or a time machine to a tournament lasting until 2 a.m. It's not just nostalgia wrapped in new graphics and updated uniforms.\n\nIt's also a referendum on college football's deepening divide, on the parity diluted by super conferences and media-rights money. It's an individual objection -- a place where Army and Akron and Appalachian State can overwhelm Alabama, where Washington State can pummel its former Pac-12 partners into apologetic pieces.\n\nIt's a place where former Notre Dame and Wake Forest quarterback Sam Hartman -- whose Demon Deacons never defeated Clemson in his five seasons as the starter -- can topple the Tigers, 105-34, as they did Tuesday.\n\n\"Just blowing off some steam...\" Hartman posted, along with a screen shot, on social media.\n\nIt's a place where anything is still possible, provided you can play.\n\n\"I think maybe in the back of our lizard brains, you have some control over it now. You can make the Cinderella story happen,\" Southorn said. \"You can build someone up, where realistically it probably wouldn't happen [in the current era of college football] because of NIL and conference affiliation. You can return it to the way it used to be and feel like college football is a little more even or fair. I think that's a big part of it.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes

Ten entire years since the last college football game was released. Do you even know who was on the cover of that game? Denard Robinson, who is now 33 years old and spent just five seasons in the NFL with the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nThe world has evidently changed quite a bit in the decade since -- we don't need to delve into the usual discourse about shifting politics, technologies, and so on -- but what hasn't is that successful football teams are built from the inside out, which is an idea that College Football '25 embraces: running the ball is your way home and passing is challenging (in a good way).\n\nBeyond just the way in which football games are won in College Football '25, the highly-anticipated EA Sports release proves itself to be a \"man's game\" in various other aspects: the recruiting process in Dynasty is meticulous, strenuous, and competitive: just like in real life. Even kicking is as challenging as it's ever been.\n\nThe stadiums and atmospheres feel lived in and alive, the gameplay up-tempo and momentum-based, all reminiscent of what it's actually like to experience the sport in this country.\n\nPerhaps best of all, College Football 25 has no restart game feature, continuing a strategic decision that the franchise first made in 2011. Comparatively, two of EA's other popular sports franchises, Madden and FIFA (now called EA FC) both feature Restart Game options.\n\nWhile something like the lack of a restart button may seem insignificant, it imbues each individual game you load up with the significance that should come with something you've waited a decade for. Losing a game hurts the way it would for the college football team you root for in real life -- there's no going back. You want to go undefeated? Better luck next year.\n\nIt's that authentic challenge that separates College Football and Madden, which both feel as though you're playing more so than trying to win.

Player editor feature is available but is not very intuitive and has limitations on customization. Limitations include being unable to fully edit players' names, stats, or physical appearance in the game.\n\nAfter 11 years, NCAA College Football is officially back. While we've had our yearly Madden titles to give us our professional football fix, all of us college-level fans have been left out in the cold. EA has heard our cries and not only revived this dormant franchise but brought it back in a bigger and better form than ever before.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25\n\nSee at Official SiteSee at Playstation StoreSee at Xbox Games Store\n\nThis is the most feature-complete NCAA game we've ever had, with every school represented and almost every player having their likenesses digitally recreated for the most authentic experience possible. While playing as our favorite teams with all the real players on the roster is a dream come true, I know a lot of us would also like to live out our fantasies of inserting ourselves onto those rosters. College Football 25 has a player editor feature built in, but it isn't as intuitive to find or use as you might hope.\n\nRelated\n\nEA Sports' College Football 25 sets a new standard for football sims\n\nCombining the tradition of college football with a host of new features that have hit the sport, College Football 25 is everything fans hoped.\n\nHow to access the player editor in NCAA College Football 25\n\nWhere to design your player\n\nEA\n\nIf you're looking to get to work designing your own player as best you can in NCAA College Football 25, accessing the feature is the easy part.\n\nStart NCAA College Football and get to the home screen Use the bumpers to toggle over to Create and Share Select Rosters Choose Manage Players The team you first selected when starting the game will appear Choose a player you want to edit and select Edit Player You will now be in the Player Editor for College Football 25\n\nRelated\n\n5 sports streaming services for watching live games\n\nSports have crept more and more into the world of streaming, and some services have become prime destinations for fans of all sorts of sports.\n\nCollege Football 25 Player Editor limitations\n\nNot as deep as you might hope\n\nEA\n\nUnfortunately, College Football 25 doesn't let you fully customize all aspects of any given player. This means you probably won't be able to insert yourself, or anyone else you would want to see, into the game. Any name and likeness (aka NIL) player, which is the vast majority of them in the game, can only have minor cosmetic features changed.\n\nThis is what you can not edit on these players:\n\nAnything on the bio screen, including name, number, position, or team None of their Ratings, which are a player's stats None of their Attributes Face, body, or any part of their physical appearance\n\nSo, if that is all locked, the only thing left that you can edit is a player's Apparel. The Apparel menu includes Head Gear, Torso, Arms, Lower Body, and Feet. However, there are still some limitations even within these categories. For example, players from Colorado have a deal with Nike so they can only wear those brands of shoes.\n\nHowever, for non-NIL players, you have a lot more options, but not complete freedom. With these players you can change:\n\nFirst and last names Position All Ratings Every Attribute except QB Throw Style Apparel Appearance\n\nAppearance is the only new section non-NIL players have compared to NIL players. This lets you adjust a player's physique, which includes their height, weight, arm size, rear size, and thighs. While this is a bit more freedom than you get with NIL players, you sadly won't be able to fully customize a player as completely as you probably want.\n\nRelated\n\nThe ESPN, Fox, and Warner sports streaming service is very much giving cable\n\nESPN, Fox, and Warner Bros are merging their sports channels into one live TV offering, but it won't have everything and might not save you money.", "source": {"uri": "pocket-lint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pocket-lint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jesse_lennox@pocket-lint.com", "name": "Jesse Lennox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Games_Store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Games Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_distribution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital distribution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clothing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://static1.pocketlintimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/travis-hunter-ea-sports-college-football.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The company froze future editions in 2013 when athletes began questioning why they weren't getting paid to be featured in the games.\n\nWith athlete compensation rights sorted out in court and now allowed by the NCAA, EA Sports announced in 2021 it would be reviving the franchise. The video-game developer offered Bowl Subdivision players a minimum of $600 and a copy of the game to have their likeness included in it. More than 11,000 players accepted offers.\n\nEA Sports has said its goal for the game was \"to feel like a love letter to college football and its fans.\"\n\nUCLA, Mississippi State, San Diego State and Colorado were among the schools hosting College Football 25 events this week. Across social platforms, athletes such as LeBron James, Tim Tebow and Michael Vick -- even comedians Shane Gillis and Dan Soder -- were live-streaming head-to-head matches in the game.\n\nMichigan running back Donovan Edwards, one of the cover athletes, said in May some of the best moments of his childhood involved playing EA Sports college football with his best friend.\n\n\"Just for it to be back, as well as to be on the cover of it, it's an awesome feeling,\" he said.\n\nThe game's other standard-edition cover athletes are Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers and Colorado two-way player Travis Hunter. The deluxe edition features the backs of numerous players in a stadium tunnel, including Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe, Georgia quarterback Carson Beck and Ohio State running back Quinshon Judkins.\n\nEA Sports' college football franchise dates to the 1990s. It grew in popularity in the early 2000s as gaming systems became more advanced, allowing for revolutionary game modes such as the popular Race for the Heisman create-a-player that was introduced in NCAA Football 06.\n\nThat edition also featured historic teams, including the 1992 Alabama squad that Clemson coach Dabo Swinney played on.\n\n\"Sleeping on me a little bit,\" Swinney joked about the 70 overall rating for his player, \"WR No. 88,\" which did, however, have a 91 speed rating. \"They must have my going down the Hill speed. I appreciate the love they gave me on that.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

No. No. No. No. No. But for dedicated college football fans, the wait was even longer.\n\nBefore this week, Electronic Arts' most recent college football video game -- \"NCAA Football 14\" -- had been released on July 9, 2013. The series was then waylaid by legal disputes surrounding player likenesses, pitched into an 11-year purgatory while the sport painstakingly evolved.\n\nOf course, college athletes were finally permitted to be paid for utilizing their name, image and likeness (NIL) in 2021, which allowed EA to compensate the players it profits from. (Players who opted in received $600 ... and, of course, a copy of the game.)\n\nPeople are also reading...

Clark, a devotee of the series and NHL writer for ESPN.com, told The Seattle Times on Monday.\n\nIt's a holiday steeped in nostalgia -- in midsummer marathons on prehistoric PlayStations, in triple-option offenses and players lost to time, in critical recruiting battles for fictional five-star safeties, in regional conferences (remember them?) and in-state rivalries.\n\n\"NCAA Football 14\" had 20 predecessors, dating to \"Bill Walsh College Football\" in 1993. It also had a frenzied following, a generation of football fans who developed dynasties -- chiseling national champions out of small-school Cinderellas.\n\n\"For me it was really cool, because I got to see really good teams and players that in 1998, in Minneapolis, I wasn't ever going to see play until the bowl game,\" said Dave Southorn, 42, who later covered Boise State football for The Idaho Statesman and The Athletic. \"You got this really good view of the college football landscape through that game.\n\n\"That really helped me, to be frank, as I was figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I was like, 'Oh, this is cool.' I knew things that others didn't. Everyone was talking about Michigan or whoever. I was like, 'Have you heard of Tulane?' \"\n\nClark, likewise, celebrated the annual summer release with a weeklong marathon, as he and a friend staged a sport-wide tournament (modeled after the UEFA Champions League in European soccer) to establish supremacy.\n\n\"We did our own statistical tracking [of games],\" said Clark, 39, who traces the tournament to his high-school years in Florida from 1998 to 2002. \"We were absolute nerds about it, and we totally own it. We absolutely own it.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nConcluded Clark, who lives in Seattle: \"This is what we would do from 4 o'clock in the afternoon to 2 o'clock in the morning every day for a week.\"\n\nDecades later, the arrival of \"EA Sports College Football 25\" has attracted a similar response, flooding social-media feeds with flea flickers and stadium shots and shaking student sections. As 247Sports college football reporter and podcaster Bud Elliott posted Tuesday on X: \"The EA Sports College Football release has completely upstaged media days buzz. Search trends [online] are wild. To the point where talking college football on a college football show instead of talking about the video game is legit bad business.\"\n\nThe business of college football is also reflected in the game, as players must maneuver NIL deals and the transfer portal to retain top talent. An athlete's academics, leadership skills, health, training and brand all must be monitored.\n\nIndeed, a whole lot happened in the 4,025 days between the releases of \"NCAA Football 14\" and \"EA Sports College Football 25.\"\n\nFor the sport, the franchise ... and its fans.\n\n\"The last time this game came out, I wasn't yet engaged,\" Southorn said. \"I've been married for nine years now. That's how long it's been for me.\"\n\nJoked Clark on Monday morning, in a similar situation: \"When 1 o'clock rolls around, my wife understands that it was a great run for our marriage. We had a lot of great years. We put championships in the rafters. But I'm a ghost to her now, and she knows that, God bless her.\"\n\nSouthorn may soon count among the game-playing ghosts. The University of Colorado alum, who now handles content and communications for a hospital system in Idaho, requested off work Friday to reignite a former flame.\n\n\"Daycare is going to come in clutch,\" said the 42-year-old father and Carnation native. \"I'll get up, take [daughter Kennedy] to day care in the morning. Maybe I'll swing by the doughnut shop and grab something, and then just settle in. I'll probably order a pizza or something at lunch, because I don't want to move.\n\n\"I know I'm in a boat with a whole lot of people. When you get to 40ish and you've got kids, you don't have as much time. But I know I'm literally going to find ways to make time. Because we all need something.\"\n\nThis game, for some, is more than a silly aside -- or a time machine to a tournament lasting until 2 a.m. It's not just nostalgia wrapped in new graphics and updated uniforms.\n\nIt's also a referendum on college football's deepening divide, on the parity diluted by super conferences and media-rights money. It's an individual objection -- a place where Army and Akron and Appalachian State can overwhelm Alabama, where Washington State can pummel its former Pac-12 partners into apologetic pieces.\n\nIt's a place where former Notre Dame and Wake Forest quarterback Sam Hartman -- whose Demon Deacons never defeated Clemson in his five seasons as the starter -- can topple the Tigers, 105-34, as they did Tuesday.\n\n\"Just blowing off some steam...\" Hartman posted, along with a screen shot, on social media.\n\nIt's a place where anything is still possible, provided you can play.\n\n\"I think maybe in the back of our lizard brains, you have some control over it now. You can make the Cinderella story happen,\" Southorn said. \"You can build someone up, where realistically it probably wouldn't happen [in the current era of college football] because of NIL and conference affiliation. You can return it to the way it used to be and feel like college football is a little more even or fair. I think that's a big part of it.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes

New modes like Dynasty and Road to Glory enhance engagement with college football. Despite some UI issues, College Football 25 is a solid choice for both casual and hardcore fans.\n\nCollege Football 25 has been one of EA Sports' most hotly anticipated releases in recent memory, and it mostly lives up to the hype. New gameplay elements and unique modes prevent College Football 25 from simply being a clone of Madden, giving the game its own strong sense of identity. Though the gameplay is largely familiar, new innovations do help set it apart enough that hardcore fans have new strategies to explore.\n\nA major emphasis was put on College Football 25's immersive features during its advertising, and they are largely successful in making the game more exciting to play. College Football 25's Dynasty mode and Road to Glory mode give players exciting new ways to engage with the world of college football. As the first college football game since NCAA Football 14, College Football 25 bears the burden of restarting a fan-favorite franchise, and it mostly lives up to the task.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25\n\n8/ 10\n\nProsExcellent graphics and gameplay innovations create a strong sense of immersionDynasty mode distinguishes it from other football titles\n\nConsUI is clunky and distracting in some placesUltimate Team mode still feels like a cynical cash grab\n\nCollege Football 25's Familiar Gameplay Allows Its New Features To Shine\n\nClose\n\nIn terms of gameplay, College Football 25 does not try to reinvent the wheel, and that is for the best. Anyone who has played a Madden game in the last 10 years will be able to pick up College Football 25 and at least know the basics. By keeping the time-tested basic mechanics of a football game, College Football 25 keeps itself accessible to casual players, while also making it easy for experienced ones to experiment with the newly added features.\n\nThough the basics of College Football 25's gameplay are familiar, there are plenty of new features to get excited about. For one, players have a lot of control on the field. From easier-to-call audibles to customizable pass routes, players can make a lot of adjustments to account for an opponent's defensive set-up. The addition of player abilities allows for more strategic decisions when deciding which receiver to pass to, or what type of defense to run. These new features add a lot of depth that veteran players can plumb to improve their game.\n\nAside from new options on the field, there is an impressive level of customization options for the game in general.\n\nAside from new options on the field, there is an impressive level of customization options for the game in general. The custom playbook feature allows players to craft the perfect game plan for their personal strategy. Dynasty mode's custom divisions don't only allow players to use whatever teams they like, but they can also be used to solve some of the issues that came from divisions being restructured, like the gutting of the Pac-12. Players will also be able to build custom teams starting July 19 when the game is fully released.\n\nCollege Football 25 Provides Players A Deep Sense Of Immersion, But Occasionally Drops The Ball\n\nThe extra effort put into making College Football 25 a highly immersive experience pays off for the most part. Gone are the largely lifeless crowds of Madden NFL 24, replaced by a stadium full of lively fans who can impact the gameplay through the new Stadium Pulse meter. The stadiums themselves look gorgeous, and are convincing recreations of their real-life counterparts. The game gives players a real sense of playing in an actual stadium, instead of feeling like it's just a backdrop.\n\nIn addition to the visual changes, College Football 25's sense of immersion is strengthened by new mechanics. When a kicker misses an easy extra point, they become rattled and it negatively impacts the kickoff. The new Stadium Pulse feature allows home teams to build momentum, making it more difficult for visiting quarterbacks to focus. This helps College Football 25 feel more like a real game played by living athletes. While these features help the sense of immersion, they aren't all perfect.\n\nRelated\n\nEA Sports FC 25 Preview: Unexpected Changes To The Usual Could Be Potent\n\nEA Sports FC 25 looks to bring some large changes to the structure of the yearly sports title, based on preview information revealed.\n\nStadium Pulse mode's camera shaking can be nauseating, and many players will likely opt to switch it off immediately. Also, while the inclusion of 50 college mascots and certain school traditions is a great touch for the teams that have them, these features are noticeably absent from a majority of the schools in the game. Players excited about the pageantry shown off in the game's pre-launch videos may be disappointed to find their favorite team is stuck with generic cheerleaders or ROTC members instead of a unique mascot. It ultimately makes this element of the game feel unfinished.\n\nWhen discussing how the game looks, it's also worth noting that most game modes are plagued with clunky UI. Modes like Dynasty and Road to Glory have too many menu screens, and the experience is far from streamlined. Players spend much of their time in these modes opening and closing different menus just to get through a few basic activities. Because players need to finish certain tasks before others, it wouldn't be hard to streamline the process instead of offering the illusion of choice which results in this clunky setup.\n\nCycling through menus to pick a play can also take more time than should be necessary, sometimes forcing players to burn a timeout to avoid a penalty.\n\nCollege Football 25 has also made some questionable choices with the UI during games. Large tutorials obscure the entire bottom half of the screen until players dismiss them. Players are forced to either memorize all the necessary button prompts quickly, or sacrifice their field of vision. Cycling through menus to pick a play can also take more time than should be necessary, sometimes forcing players to burn a timeout to avoid a penalty.\n\nCollege Football 25's New Modes Are Mostly Wins\n\nAs College Football 25's basic gameplay isn't all that different from a Madden game, a lot of weight falls on its unique game modes to set it apart. Unfortunately, the game's various modes do struggle to bear the load evenly. Dynasty mode is the stand-out. Its unique recruitment mini-game can be very rewarding when players start to see their acquired players having a positive impact on their program. There is a real sense of progression from year-to-year, giving players a sense of real accomplishment when their choices pay off.\n\nThough Road to Glory mode shares some similarities with Dynasty mode, it is more of a mixed bag. Players looking to challenge themselves with an underdog player may find themselves riding the bench for extended periods of time, shifting the balance of gameplay too far in favor of the time-management elements and away from football. Alternatively, players who pick a high-ranked player so they can actually engage with the entire experience may find it too easy, going undefeated their freshman year.\n\nRoad to Glory'srole-playing element is also largely hollow. There is no real overarching narrative, so players don't feel bad blowing off their fictional teammates to study. Responding to texts quickly becomes a game of just picking whatever dialogue option the player knows will gain them points in the specific area they want to advance, as there is no real incentive to engage with the barebones narrative that is presented.\n\nA lot of words have been spent criticizing the cynical pay-to-win nature of Madden's Ultimate Team mode, and College Football 25 has done nothing to address these concerns. Ultimate Team mode has its fans, and it must be profitable for EA Sports to keep including it. That said, many players will likely never engage with the mode once they realize its mostly a combination of gaming's worst trends: battle passes, loot boxes, and paying for in-game currency.\n\nFinal Thoughts On College Football 25\n\n4/5 - \"Excellent\" By Screen Rant's Review Metric\n\nCollege Football 25 has its faults, but they aren't bad enough to ruin the experience. Innovations to the gameplay will give experienced players fun new tools, while the game's familiar elements make it perfect for casual players just looking for a fun multiplayer experience with friends. The steps taken to make the game more immersive mostly pay off, making this the best looking football game players can buy.\n\nBeing the first college football game in a decade also works heavily in favor of College Football 25. Were this an annual franchise, elements like its clunky UI may be more of a sticking point. However, as it stands now, College Football 25 will bea must-play for any hardcore college football fans, and the excitement of the new release helps players ignore some of its flaws.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25\n\nFranchise EA Sports College Football\n\nPlatform(s) PS5 , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased July 19, 2024\n\nDeveloper(s) EA Orlando\n\nESRB E For Everyone Due To Alcohol Reference", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_migalla@screenrant.com", "name": "Sean Migalla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "User interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G4_(American_TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "G4 (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur's_Gate_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baldur's Gate (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_clone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game clone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_&_Dragons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dungeons & Dragons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_game_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perfect game (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cycle sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Officers'_Training_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Officers' Training Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-out_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Time-out (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pink Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic_Study", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic Study", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/college-football1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 3242, "textEnd": 3249}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 9296, "textEnd": 9303}], "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

At the time, it was super cool to see the college players accurately reflected in the game, because that's something we've never had until this new game that just came out.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25, releasing Friday, is the first college football video game to hit consoles since NCAA Football 14 in 2013. While NFL football video games have remained a mainstay, most notably EA's Madden franchise, many avid football fans miss the ability to play as their favorite schools and alma maters.\n\nI've been waiting specifically for the college football game to return for the past decade. It's my favorite sports series of all time, said Nutzman, 30, who was among those who got an early start after pre-ordering a deluxe edition that debuted Tuesday. So it was very, very easy for me to dive back into the game when it launched yesterday.\n\nThe NCAA Football video game series was canceled in 2013 after courts sided with former players WHO sued the game developer above the use of their likenesses.\n\nPreviously, the names of the athletes in EA's American football game were not explicitly mentioned, despite the fact that the players in the game resembled real athletes, down to their jersey numbers.\n\nA 2021 Supreme Court ruling opened the door for change, finding that the NCAA had violated antitrust rules by banning players from making money. The NCAA quickly instituted a policy that allowed college athletes to monetize their name, image and likeness, now commonly known as NIL. That has led to a flood of sponsorship money that continues to reshape college sports.\n\nEA's new football game is now almost certainly the biggest example of this, with over 11,000 players named in the game, according to The New York Times.\n\nAn EA Sports spokesperson confirmed that the company paid athletes who wanted to play the game a minimum of $600 and a copy of the game.\n\nQuinn Ewers of the University of Texas, Donovan Edwards of the University of Michigan and Travis Hunter of the University of Colorado are featured on the cover of the contest, with the Cotton Bowl in the background.\n\nThe game has already been well received by a number of popular video game streamers, including Kai Cenat and Sketch, who have broadcast the game for hours to millions of viewers.\n\nFootball analyst Warren Sharp posted on X on Monday that it appears more than 660,000 people are already playing the game online.\n\nSome on social media said the graphics, from the players to the realistic-looking pitch, looked exceptional, while others praised the game's smooth and responsive controls.\n\nTimothy Martin, 25, a sports content creator and former quarterback for Mayville State University in North Dakota, where he is now a member of the coaching staff, said the game simulates sports in a way he's never seen before. (Mayville is not a playable team in the game, Martin said.)\n\nHe has few to no complaints.\n\nThey exceeded my expectations, Martin said. My biggest fear was that the game was essentially Madden, but the player movements and everything felt more realistic than ever before. [in a video game].\n\nMany others raved about the gameplay and the various modes, including Road to Glory and Dynasty. The game also features a new mode called Road to the College Football Playoffs, which all, according to IGNwant to emulate the real-world changes to college football since the last title came out. The new version allows users to play against other people over the internet or against the game itself.\n\nI personally have so much love for the college football series, and even though it's not called NCAA Football, it's kind of the spiritual successor to that series, Nutzman said. So it feels so great to see it come back after an 11-year absence, when it meant so much to me growing up and meant so much to my love of sports growing up.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com",

It's become tradition for the next iteration in the series to launch about two weeks before the start of a new season, as EA looks to take advantage of fresh fan optimism about their teams potentially winning the prestigious Super Bowl. However, the going has been anything but smooth in recent years. Besides a handful of cosmetic changes, there's little gameplay innovation between each iteration. That's can't be the case for Madden NFL 25, as College Football 25 is grabbing headlines for all the right reasons.\n\nGaming franchises can hardly afford to be perceived as lacking imagination, especially in the face of stiff competition from other developers, whether indie or established corporations. The category of sports has a slightly different complexion in this regard. Licensing and a myriad of similar issues have practically created a market monopoly for Madden NFL, NBA 2K, and EA FC to an extent. Perhaps due to this status quo, improvements have been scant in these franchises, and Madden NFL in particular has been accused of being the same game every year with a different name. Overcoming this perception will be an uphill climb for Madden NFL 25, especially with College Football 25's popularity waxing stronger.\n\nRelated\n\nCollege Football 25 Top 100 Players Revealed\n\nAhead of its July 16 launch, EA Sports reveals the 100 athletes in College Football 25 with the highest overall rating in the game.\n\nCollege Football 25's Novelty and Brilliance Raises Questions for Madden NFL 25\n\nClose\n\nThe first problem Madden NFL 25 is barreling towards lies in its launch window. A mid-August release date has been EA's modus operandi for the longest time, and that will continue with the next edition slated for August 16. However, with all the hype that College Football 25 is getting despite still being in its preorder phase, it's clear that it could dominate the sports landscape for the foreseeable future. That spells trouble for Madden NFL 25, as its fan base almost totally overlaps with College Football 25, and many might justifiably wonder if the new Madden is worth it. Both games might come from the same studio in EA Orlando and have unique premises, but they're direct competitors in outlook.\n\nWith this in mind, EA seems to be going all out for Madden NFL 25 to at least pique interest. Much-needed revamps are coming to the fundamentals of football, most notably with BOOM Tech's touted Physics-Based Tackling. Players will presumably have more control over the field through improvements in attacking the ball and expanded playbooks to run their offenses. As a cherry on top of these enhancements, Madden NFL 25 is adding a Team Builder feature for fans to design their own teams, complete with personalization options in uniforms and logos. However, it's unclear whether these reforms will be the X-factor needed to draw fan attention back to Madden NFL even after College Football 25's supposed \"honeymoon period\" elapses.\n\nThe Long Wait for College Football Might Be Too Much for Madden NFL 25 to Overcome\n\nFor starters, College Football 25 is EA's first foray into the NCAA scene after a decade, and the protracted absence has worked wonders for the developer. The Dynasty and Road to Glory modes are driving forces behind the gleaming reviews so far, and they are ideas that fans have wanted to see implemented in Madden NFL with a few pro-tailored twists. Dynasty allows players to create and build their ideal program, not just as head coaches; but also as coordinators. Both designations have contractual expectations for players to meet, and coaching ability can be improved along archetypes in order to achieve these goals.\n\nSimilarly, the Road to Glory mode showcases the life of a college athlete striving to win it all and hoist the Heisman Trophy. It's not hard to fathom why College Football 25 might only continue to grow in popularity when considering the novelty of these modes. Although there are currently a few mechanical struggles like making a field goal, the boons of the college sporting experience easily outweigh the cons. That's something Madden NFL 25 will undoubtedly have a hard time competing with, even if its proposed improvements change the status quo -- it might not feel \"new\" and good enough to challenge College Football 25.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25\n\nThe first entry in EA's series since 2013's NCAA Football 14, EA Sports College Football 25 is a sports sim that focuses on realistically

My digital ECU quarterback is the real Jake Garcia, handing off to the real Rahjai Harris. They're both trying to evade digital Wyoming defensive tackles Ben Florentine and Jordan Bertagnole, who are real dudes who play for the Cowboys. All in all, Electronic Arts paid for the real licenses to over 11,000 college athletes, in what EA Tiburon developers claim is the largest depiction of real people in a video game... maybe ever. Certainly in a sports video game.\n\nFor years, EA couldn't pay the athletes, which is why older editions of NCAA Football had rosters full of players with names like QB #15 and RB #3 -- players who just so happened to closely resemble the real, and uncompensated, athletes. Eventually, the athletes sued, EA paid back damages, schools pulled their licenses, and the franchise was shelved.\n\nBut now, the NCAA has finally thrown out its outdated notions of amateurism, and athletes can be compensated not just for their digital likenesses in video games, but for all manner of other commercial activities, paving the way for EA's college football video game franchise to return.\n\nIs it a perfect college football video game? No. But it's one that was clearly made by college football fans, for college football fans. It's a game that was worth the wait.\n\nSo much of what makes college football, college football, is the environment in which it's played: the stadiums, the crowd chants, the uniforms, mascots, and everything else that goes into making game day a little bit different at each of the 134 FBS schools in the game.\n\nThanks to open records requests and regular ol' phone calls, I've reported extensively over the last several years on how EA, and the individual schools, have sought to digitally re-create those experiences. Schools submitted dozens of audio files, from what they play on third downs to what non-R-rated chants their students yell to what riffs their marching bands play. EA asked for hundreds of stadium photographs from every conceivable angle, as well as locker room shots and seating charts, so the game's developers could more accurately render everything from the exact location in which the opposing band sits to what the tunnel walk into each team's stadium looks like.\n\nEA didn't nail this every single time. There are a few stadiums whose recent renovations were missed; most mascots outside the biggest brands aren't included; and some uniforms and logos are imperfectly rendered. It doesn't appear that EA opened its wallet to license very many songs, so iconic college football traditions like Wisconsin's \"Jump Around,\" or \"Enter Sandman\" at Virginia Tech, aren't included. The lack of a robust music library means that you're going to hear \"Mo Bamba\" a lot during games, and the drumline-only soundtrack during menus even more than a lot. (I'm a former band geek drummer myself. I love me some cowbell and marching snares. But even I had to mute the music sometimes.)\n\nBut on the whole, I think EA did an excellent job. Team-specific turnover stunts, like a turnover throne? In the game. Teams singing the alma mater to the crowd after the 4th quarter ends? In the game. Minnesota's mascot rotating his head in a complete 360, like out of some horror movie? In the game. The list goes on.\n\nThe attention to detail isn't just about the school-specific stuff, but about College Football 25's presentation of the game of football itself. If you look down the sidelines before you snap the ball, you can see assistants holding up massive play call placards, just like they do during real games. You'll see your quarterback glance toward the sideline if you change the play call at the line of scrimmage. If you rip the heart out of the home crowd, you'll see fans doing the surrender cobra. The game includes two different broadcast teams who recorded tens of thousands of lines of commentary, as well as studio cut-ins, which adds to the immersion. It's very easy to feel like you're playing in a major broadcast window, even if you're playing Wyoming at East Carolina.\n\nThe common concern I heard from other fans for months, if not years, leading up to this game's release was the worry that EA would simply make College Football 25 a \"Madden reskin\" -- essentially, a rerelease of its NFL game, only with Nebraska and Alabama uniforms.\n\nAre there similarities? Of course. It's still football, and both games are made by the same studio and have shared staffers. But I can conclusively state that the games play and feel very different.\n\nThis game also feels very different from NCAA Football 14, and anybody expecting to simply import all of that built-up muscle memory and dominate from the first snap is in for a rude awakening.\n\nIn my experience, this year's college football game is a lot harder than NCAA 14. For one, the passing system has been completely revamped, with the game putting a huge emphasis on properly \"layering\" the ball in coverage. Each pass has a blue/yellow/red meter, depending on the QB rating, the pressure, and the angle and type of pass thrown. If you hold the button down too long, trying to throw a bullet pass, your accuracy will take a major dive. The pass you end up throwing might still be catchable, but the wideout might need to break stride to grab it, turning what should be a walk-in touchdown into merely a big gain.\n\nConsider the following example that I experienced numerous times over my first 20 hours. A quarterback drops back to pass to a wideout running a post route. In a perfect world, the QB throws the ball over any lurking linebackers and hits the receiver juuuust in front of him, so he can catch the ball in stride. Even if my receiver was open, if I pushed the button too lightly, the ball might \"float\" too much, allowing the defender to catch up to his man and break up the play. Throw the ball too low, and the linebacker could pick off the pass. If I didn't hit the meter perfectly, maybe my guy would catch the ball and immediately trip over himself and falls down.\n\nIt takes a lot of practice. You can make the right decision, get your guy open, and still easily mess up the pass. It can be frustrating if you're expecting to instantly run a competent Air Raid offense, but I mostly appreciated the challenge. It makes completed big plays feel even more like an accomplishment.\n\nRunning the ball has also changed. The AI around blocking schemes has improved, and new animations and physics make it easier to fight through arm tackles or poor pursuit angles. The option system has also been revamped. The good news is that players now have multiple types of pitches they can throw, which can open up the playbook beyond the commonly used Read Option. The bad news is that the button scheme to hand the ball off or keep it has flipped from the last few years, meaning that I spent hours handing off the ball when I meant to hold on to it.\n\nThe new mechanics on offense take time to practice, but they're not totally inaccessible. Defense, however, feels much harder. In my very first game, I played my beloved alma mater, Ohio State (one of the very best teams in the game), and took them on the road to play a middling BYU squad, my wife's alma mater. I gave up 49 points with five-minute quarters, as the Cougars ripped off multiple 50-plus-yard touchdown bombs. Figuring out how to switch to the right defender, how to take the proper pursuit angle, and that I shouldn't Hit Stick on every opportunity was not easy.\n\nI've gotten a little better at playing against the AI, but online, I still haven't cracked the code on playing effective defense, and I'll give up 250-plus rushing yards to virtually any competent opponent. I've found that if I'm not forcing a turnover, getting consistent stops takes practice, a good eye... and probably a little luck.\n\nCollege Football 25 offers five main game modes: Play Now, Dynasty, Road to Glory, Ultimate Team, and Road to the College Football Playoff. Road to the CFP is the game's ranked online play system, and is the mode that I've played the least. I've spent the bulk of my time in Dynasty, RTG, and Ultimate Team.\n\nDynasty has been the bread and butter of EA's college football series for years. Here, players can create their own coach, hire a coaching staff, set their schedule, recruit players, and take over a college football program.\n\nOne area where EA clearly tried to add complexity and depth is with coaching skills. Just like in previous years, coaches can level up and add new skills by completing certain recruiting or in-game goals. But in previous editions, just about everybody would beeline to trying to max out their coach recruiting tree. In practice, there was really only one way to build your coach, and after a few seasons, you could fill out the entire skill tree.\n\nNow players can pick between different coach archetypes, like a master recruiter, tactician, or motivator, while blending skills from different trees. You can also hire coordinators, who have their own skill trees, leaving you to decide if you want to double (or triple) down on your strengths, or build out a more balanced staff. I actually found the nonrecruiting buffs like tactician to be very helpful when turning around underdog programs, and I love that there are now multiple ways to approach running a program.\n\nRecruiting is substantially deeper than in previous years. Users will need to allocate time to not just scout individual recruits, but also to determine what sorts of things the athletes are interested in, like playing time, campus environment, and coach prestige. The process makes it much easier to become attached to certain recruits, and winning a tough battle feels more rewarding. But it's also way harder to recruit athletes to lower-profile schools than it was in previous years. It doesn't matter if you go 9-3 and win the Who Gives a Crap Bowl with your MAC program in year one; you aren't signing more than maybe one four-star recruit out of high school right off the bat. Just like in real life.\n\nThe recruiting system grapples with a critically important question in college video game design: Where is the line between realism and fun? In real life, if users had to manage a roster exactly the same way coaches at Power Four institutions do, they'd absolutely hate it. They'd hate the shady payroll management via outside collectives, hate the babysitting of 19-year-olds, hate needing to send a gazillion texts to teenagers, the whole thing. This game simplifies some systems in a nod to preserving the fun, even if some die-hards would probably wish for a more Football Manager-like simulator.\n\nIf I had one early critique of my time in Dynasty, it's that the computer doesn't do a great job simulating other results. In my most recent Dynasty (where I created a coach named Dallan McRomneyson to take over Utah State), Notre Dame, Florida State, and Clemson all started out 0-2. High-profile teams probably lose a little too often right now, which I've seen lead to some pretty funny College Football Playoff scenarios. UMass Minutemen, you are a College Football Playoff participant! Georgia Bulldogs, get ready for the Autozone Liberty Bowl!\n\nRoad to Glory is a faster-paced mode, allowing the user to take over the career of a college athlete, as you balance academic, social, and athletic pursuits. I know many fans were sad to learn that EA removed the high school football component of the mode, but I actually enjoy the change. You can complete an entire career in under 20 hours, and the resource management mode (which requires everybody to make some trade-offs), plus a large library of scenarios (complete with weighted-dice-roll randomized answers), means that no two playthroughs are the same.\n\nI started with a five-star running back out of Rhode Island who I named Chuck Steak. I decided to send him to Stanford, where he'd have a chance to start right away, but would also need to spend a legitimate amount of time focusing on school to stay academically eligible. The pacing of the player progression system doesn't allow you to make some 99-overall mutant by week 7 of your freshman year, but you can put up some huge numbers as an upperclassman if you can stay healthy.\n\nThe gameplay can be frustrating if you're not on a great team (good luck throwing the ball without an offensive line!), or if you don't have great coach trust (good luck being a quarterback if your coach calls nothing but handoffs!), but that's also realistic. It turns out, you generally can't play like Broken Leg Greg Jennings very often in real life.\n\nI've actually been pleasantly surprised with Ultimate Team, although I completely understand if other people are decidedly uninterested in the mode. I found it was an excellent introduction to the new playbooks and game mechanics, giving users a chance to run quick challenges to familiarize themselves with the differences between the Air Raid and the Veer and Shoot. With a large selection of single-player options and a massive base of potential cards -- the mode includes not just current college football stars, but NFL players and historic college legends as well -- there's a lot of potential.\n\nI did not feel any immediate need to buy cards or points in order to complete any single-player objectives, but I also have no designs on being a competitive online player. Like with any other AAA sports title's Ultimate Team mode, I imagine it will be very difficult, over the course of the year, to be a competitive online No Money Spent player.\n\nCollege Football 25 isn't perfect. But neither is real-life college football.\n\nI don't love college football because I think it's a perfectly well-oiled, efficient machine. It isn't! The sport is terribly governed, faces a multitude of existential challenges, and sometimes produces glitchy, even unwatchable, results.\n\nBut it's beautiful and fun in spite of the warts and glitches -- because it's ours. I didn't go to the Chicago Bears; I went to Ohio State. I rang the victory bell. I sat in that press box. I feel a tiny stirring within myself whenever I see the Dotting of the I, because of the deep connection that institution has to my own personal history.\n\nFans haven't just wanted to play a football simulation with a team that wears Scarlet and Gray uniforms instead of Orange and Brown ones. They've wanted to replicate that connection. And here, I think EA Sports College Football 25 delivers the goods.\n\nAgain, it isn't a perfect video game. I imagine some of its shortcomings, like the missing uniforms, assorted display bugs -- all the players in Ultimate Team, for example, show up as being from Alabama, even though they get the player's hometown correct (which is kinda funny, if immersion-breaking) -- and other stuff will get patched relatively quickly. Other quirks, like the simulation logic or defensive AI, might take longer to fix. It isn't hard to think of plenty of new stuff the dev team could add to next year's game.\n\nBut this game is also very clearly a labor of love from developers who deeply care about college football and college football culture. It's a testament to what is possible with sports games when teams have longer than a few months to crank out AAA titles. And if this is the foundation for future college football games, then the series is in a very, very good place.\n\nWould I have liked to have college football video games over the last decade? Of course. But this edition?\n\nThis was worth the wait.", "source": {"uri": "polygon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Polygon"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Physical copies can be bought at a range of stores whilst digital copies are available to download from PS Store and Xbox Store.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google Play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_25", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL 25"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Games_Store", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Games Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IBM PC compatible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Developers_and_Publishers/Independent_Developers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Developers and Publishers/Independent Developers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/e5a2b1d26245259f1f51a30ac8f34278/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/07/19/17214008833810.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 158, "textEnd": 165}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

No. No. No. No. No. But for dedicated college football fans, the wait was even longer.\n\nBefore this week, Electronic Arts' most recent college football video game -- \"NCAA Football 14\" -- had been released on July 9, 2013. The series was then waylaid by legal disputes surrounding player likenesses, pitched into an 11-year purgatory while the sport painstakingly evolved.\n\nOf course, college athletes were finally permitted to be paid for utilizing their name, image and likeness (NIL) in 2021, which allowed EA to compensate the players it profits from. (Players who opted in received $600 ... and, of course, a copy of the game.)\n\nPeople are also reading...

Flick Fact: Is there really a river under Normal?\n\nAt precisely 1 p.m. Monday, the \"Is EA Sports College Football Out\" account posted one more word.\n\nThe wait was over.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"For a lot of people, this is a holiday,\" Ryan S. Clark, a devotee of the series and NHL writer for ESPN.com, told The Seattle Times on Monday.\n\nIt's a holiday steeped in nostalgia -- in midsummer marathons on prehistoric PlayStations, in triple-option offenses and players lost to time, in critical recruiting battles for fictional five-star safeties, in regional conferences (remember them?) and in-state rivalries.\n\n\"NCAA Football 14\" had 20 predecessors, dating to \"Bill Walsh College Football\" in 1993. It also had a frenzied following, a generation of football fans who developed dynasties -- chiseling national champions out of small-school Cinderellas.\n\n\"For me it was really cool, because I got to see really good teams and players that in 1998, in Minneapolis, I wasn't ever going to see play until the bowl game,\" said Dave Southorn, 42, who later covered Boise State football for The Idaho Statesman and The Athletic. \"You got this really good view of the college football landscape through that game.\n\n\"That really helped me, to be frank, as I was figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I was like, 'Oh, this is cool.' I knew things that others didn't. Everyone was talking about Michigan or whoever. I was like, 'Have you heard of Tulane?' \"\n\nClark, likewise, celebrated the annual summer release with a weeklong marathon, as he and a friend staged a sport-wide tournament (modeled after the UEFA Champions League in European soccer) to establish supremacy.\n\n\"We did our own statistical tracking [of games],\" said Clark, 39, who traces the tournament to his high-school years in Florida from 1998 to 2002. \"We were absolute nerds about it, and we totally own it. We absolutely own it.\"\n\nConcluded Clark, who lives in Seattle: \"This is what we would do from 4 o'clock in the afternoon to 2 o'clock in the morning every day for a week.\"\n\nDecades later, the arrival of \"EA Sports College Football 25\" has attracted a similar response, flooding social-media feeds with flea flickers and stadium shots and shaking student sections. As 247Sports college football reporter and podcaster Bud Elliott posted Tuesday on X: \"The EA Sports College Football release has completely upstaged media days buzz. Search trends [online] are wild. To the point where talking college football on a college football show instead of talking about the video game is legit bad business.\"\n\nThe business of college football is also reflected in the game, as players must maneuver NIL deals and the transfer portal to retain top talent. An athlete's academics, leadership skills, health, training and brand all must be monitored.\n\nIndeed, a whole lot happened in the 4,025 days between the releases of \"NCAA Football 14\" and \"EA Sports College Football 25.\"\n\nFor the sport, the franchise ... and its fans.\n\n\"The last time this game came out, I wasn't yet engaged,\" Southorn said. \"I've been married for nine years now. That's how long it's been for me.\"\n\nJoked Clark on Monday morning, in a similar situation: \"When 1 o'clock rolls around, my wife understands that it was a great run for our marriage. We had a lot of great years. We put championships in the rafters. But I'm a ghost to her now, and she knows that, God bless her.\"\n\nSouthorn may soon count among the game-playing ghosts. The University of Colorado alum, who now handles content and communications for a hospital system in Idaho, requested off work Friday to reignite a former flame.\n\n\"Daycare is going to come in clutch,\" said the 42-year-old father and Carnation native. \"I'll get up, take [daughter Kennedy] to day care in the morning. Maybe I'll swing by the doughnut shop and grab something, and then just settle in. I'll probably order a pizza or something at lunch, because I don't want to move.\n\n\"I know I'm in a boat with a whole lot of people. When you get to 40ish and you've got kids, you don't have as much time. But I know I'm literally going to find ways to make time. Because we all need something.\"\n\nThis game, for some, is more than a silly aside -- or a time machine to a tournament lasting until 2 a.m. It's not just nostalgia wrapped in new graphics and updated uniforms.\n\nIt's also a referendum on college football's deepening divide, on the parity diluted by super conferences and media-rights money. It's an individual objection -- a place where Army and Akron and Appalachian State can overwhelm Alabama, where Washington State can pummel its former Pac-12 partners into apologetic pieces.\n\nIt's a place where former Notre Dame and Wake Forest quarterback Sam Hartman -- whose Demon Deacons never defeated Clemson in his five seasons as the starter -- can topple the Tigers, 105-34, as they did Tuesday.\n\n\"Just blowing off some steam...\" Hartman posted, along with a screen shot, on social media.\n\nIt's a place where anything is still possible, provided you can play.\n\n\"I think maybe in the back of our lizard brains, you have some control over it now. You can make the Cinderella story happen,\" Southorn said. \"You can build someone up, where realistically it probably wouldn't happen [in the current era of college football] because of NIL and conference affiliation. You can return it to the way it used to be and feel like college football is a little more even or fair. I think that's a big part of it.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or

The company froze future editions in 2013 when athletes began questioning why they weren't getting paid to be featured in the games.\n\nWith athlete compensation rights sorted out in court and now allowed by the NCAA, EA Sports announced in 2021 it would be reviving the franchise. The video-game developer offered Bowl Subdivision players a minimum of $600 and a copy of the game to have their likeness included in it. More than 11,000 players accepted offers.\n\nEA Sports has said its goal for the game was \"to feel like a love letter to college football and its fans.\"\n\nSan Diego State and Colorado were among the schools hosting College Football 25 events this week. Across social platforms, athletes such as LeBron James, Tim Tebow and Michael Vick -- even comedians Shane Gillis and Dan Soder -- were live-streaming head-to-head matches in the game.\n\nMichigan running back Donovan Edwards, one of the cover athletes, said in May some of the best moments of his childhood involved playing EA Sports college football with his best friend.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Just for it to be back, as well as to be on the cover of it, it's an awesome feeling,\" he said.\n\nThe game's other standard-edition cover athletes are Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers and Colorado two-way player Travis Hunter. The deluxe edition features the backs of numerous players in a stadium tunnel, including Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe, Georgia quarterback Carson Beck and Ohio State running back Quinshon Judkins.\n\nEA Sports' college football franchise dates to the 1990s. It grew in popularity in the early 2000s as gaming systems became more advanced, allowing for revolutionary game modes such as the popular Race for the Heisman create-a-player that was introduced in NCAA Football 06.\n\nThat edition also featured historic teams, including the 1992 Alabama squad that Clemson coach Dabo Swinney played on.\n\n\"Sleeping on me a little bit,\" Swinney joked about the 70 overall rating for his player, \"WR No. 88,\" which did, however, have a 91 speed rating. \"They must have my going down the Hill speed. I appreciate the love they gave me on that.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Pete Iacobelli contributed to this report.\n\nAP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football.

Here's Why.", "body": "Every product was carefully curated by an Esquire editor. We may earn a commission from these links.\n\nLet me tell you how damn good EA Sports College Football 25's attention to detail is. Every college football team has no less than thirty insane gimmicks, stunts, and traditions that they'll whip out over the course of a game. Let's take, for instance, Pitt, where I went to school. Well, we manage to rip off both the Red Sox (\"Sweet Caroline\" blares after the third quarter, which is inadvertently the Go Home tune, because we suck) and the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders (the team sadly trots out to \"Thunderstruck\").\n\nBut the worst Pitt quirk is The Meow. Every time the team enjoys one brief, shining moment of competence -- which, again, is not often! -- the stadium blares this ungodly mechanical noise that vaguely resembles a panther's roar. But it really sounds like meow-wow-wow!, as if Mr. Whiskers, your cat, loudly asked for treats from the inside of a tin can.\n\n'\n\nThat's all to say: College Football 25 has The Meow. To a tee. It sounds precisely as awful as it does in real life. But they got it right.\n\nIt's a ridiculous thing to focus on, sure, but it's also a microcosm of what EA Sports managed to pull off with its first entry in the series -- previously branded NCAA Football -- in 11 years. EA stopped producing the game in 2013, settling with former college football players who rightfully took issue with the use of their names, images, and likenesses without compensation or their permission. Now that universities are finally cutting checks for their athletes' efforts, EA revived the beloved (and sorely missed by yours truly) series.\n\nAnd the promises were big. Three years ago, EA Sports bigwig Daryl Holt, initially promising a 2024 release date, told ESPN, \"That's the best date for us to bring the game that we think is going to meet or exceed our player expectations. And cover the breadth and scale of what we want in the game. We're trying to build a very immersive college football experience.\" I'll forgive you for reading this as PR-speak, considering fans accuse College Football's older brother -- the iconic Madden franchise -- of shipping out a relatively unchanged product, year after year.\n\nI won't get into that here, because I really need to wrap up this piece and start year two of my \"Dynasty\" mode, which is exactly as stellar -- if not better -- than you remember. And if EA Sports' hilariously long \"Dynasty\" deep-dive blog didn't tip you off, there's a lot to do in this experience, where you can control a college football program for a maximum of thirty years. The recruiting process includes, but certainly isn't limited to: DMing players, contacting their friends and family, tooling around in the transfer portal, and scheduling campus visits. As someone who's sick enough to have loved the boardroom immersion of NFL Head Coach, College Football 25's reimagining of the mode is exceptional. After just 10 hours in \"Dynasty,\" I'm now somewhat confident I could've succeeded Nick Saban at Alabama. Give me that booster money!\n\nAs for the gameplay? If you're a Madden player with a reaction time half as embarrassing as mine, I'm willing to bet that you call one of two plays on offense: 1) Inside Run, or 2) Slants. College Football 25 breaks open the playbook for casuals, making a run-and-gun-type or Air Raid college offense relatively accessible. Running the ball is fun again. Whereas Madden is often a few-yards-at-a-time grind (or the alternative, chucking the rock with Mahomes), there's much more opportunity to juke, spin, and flash some creativity after the handoff.\n\nPassing is more dynamic; the game will prompt you to press an extra button if you want to make another move after the catch. Not to mention, College Football 25 even introduces a two-step kicking meter, which, uh, actually has led to a few doinks from me.Wouldn't you know it, playing College Football 25 actually feels like playing...college football. High scores, big plays, batshit playbooks -- you name it.\n\nNow, I have an intimidating amount of experiences left to explore, including \"Road to Glory,\" where you can create a player and win a whole lot of Heisman trophies. \"Ultimate Team\" has all of the legends we never (virtually) met over the past 11 years. Freaking Tim Tebow is in this game! In a time where industry layoffs are threatening to cheapen what we play, it's downright heartening to see the level of care EA Sports gave to College Football 25. Heck, when you fire up a Pitt home game, Rece Davis name-checks all of the school's greats: Dorsett, Marino, Ditka. Now imagine that amount of love for 131 teams.

Known for hits like FIFA and Madden, EA's reputation recently took a hit due to repetitive updates and buggy releases. So, when EA Sports College Football 25 was announced, the gaming community held its breath. Would this revival be a game-changer or another fumble?\n\nFortunately, EA Sports College Football 25 delivers where it counts. As someone who's been critical of recent EA Sports titles, I can confidently say this game marks a significant improvement. It builds upon Madden's solid football mechanics with enhancements that fans have been craving. The game's presentation is vibrant and polished, setting a new standard for EA Sports. Modes like Road to Glory and Dynasty offer depth and customization options that elevate the experience beyond typical sports simulations.\n\nUnlike other recent sports game updates that felt like minor tweaks, College Football 25 feels like a leap forward for the franchise. Running on the Frostbite Engine, it stands out as one of the best-looking sports games available, especially on current-gen consoles like Xbox Series X. The attention to detail in stadiums, mascots, and game atmosphere gives it an edge over even EA's flagship NFL games.\n\nOf course, no game is without its hiccups. There are occasional frame rate issues and connectivity glitches, particularly in online play. However, these issues pale in comparison to the technical woes seen in recent Madden releases.\n\nWhat really sets College Football 25 apart is its gameplay and modes. The on-field action is reminiscent of Madden but tailored for the college game, emphasizing fast-paced, explosive plays. Modes like Road to Glory and Dynasty offer immersive experiences where players can craft their own athletic journey or manage an entire team's destiny.\n\nDynasty mode, in particular, shines with its detailed player management and customizable conferences, a feature sorely missed in Madden. Scouting high school talent feels engaging and strategic, adding depth to recruiting that Madden's franchise mode lacks.\n\nAs EA Sports College Football 25 hits shelves, it's clear that EA has scored a win. This game not only revitalizes the college football gaming experience but also sets a promising precedent for future EA Sports titles. If EA continues to learn from this success, we might just see a new era of innovation in sports gaming.", "source": {"uri": "businessupturn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Upturn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sports video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite_(game_engine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frostbite (game engine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mascot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Developers_and_Publishers/Independent_Developers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Developers and Publishers/Independent Developers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Drinking_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Drinking Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://images.businessupturn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/safeimagekit-EA-Sports-College-Football-25-1024x576.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

While NFL football video games have remained a mainstay -- most notably EA's Madden franchise -- many fervent college football fans have missed the ability to play as their favorite schools and alma maters.\n\n\"I have been waiting ... specifically for the college football game to come back for the last decade. It's my favorite sports series of all time,\" said Nutzman, 30, who was among those who started playing early after ordering a deluxe edition that came out Tuesday. \"So it was very, very easy for me to jump back in to the game when it launched yesterday.\"\n\nThe NCAA Football video game series was discontinued in 2013 after courts sided with former players who sued the game developer over using their likenesses.\n\nPreviously, EA's college football game didn't explicitly name the athletes despite the game modeling players on actual collegiate athletes right down to the jersey number.\n\nA Supreme Court ruling in 2021 opened the door for changes, finding that the NCAA had violated antitrust rules by stopping players from making money. The NCAA quickly instituted a policy that allowed college athletes to make money off of their name, image and likeness, now commonly called NIL. That has led to a flood of sponsorship money that continues to reshape college athletics.\n\nEA's new football game is now almost certainly the largest example of that, with more than 11,000 players named in the game, according to The New York Times.\n\nA spokesperson for EA Sports confirmed that it paid athletes who opted in to the game a minimum of $600 and a copy of the game.\n\nUniversity of Texas' Quinn Ewers, University of Michigan's Donovan Edwards and University of Colorado's Travis Hunter appear on the game's cover with the Cotton Bowl in the background.\n\nThe game has already been well received by some popular video game streamers, including Kai Cenat and Sketch, who have spent hours broadcasting the game to millions of viewers.\n\nWarren Sharp, a football analyst, posted on X on Monday that it appeared more than 660,000 people were already playing the game online.\n\nSome on social media said the graphics -- from the players to the realistic-looking turf -- looked exceptional, while others lauded the game's snappy and responsive controls.\n\nTimothy Martin, 25, a sports content creator and former quarterback for Mayville State University in North Dakota, where he's now a member of the coaching staff, said the game replicates the sport with a kind of realism he's never seen before. (Mayville is not a playable team in the game, Martin said.)\n\nHe has few -- if any -- complaints.\n\n\"They've actually exceeded my expectations,\" Martin said. \"My biggest fear was like the game was essentially like Madden, but the movements and everything of the players feel more realistic than we've ever had [in a video game].\"\n\nMany others raved about the gameplay and the various modes, which include \"Road to Glory\" and \"Dynasty.\" The game also includes a new mode called \"Road to the College Football Playoffs,\" all of which, according to IGN, intend to replicate the real-world adjustments made to college football since the last title came out. With the new version, users can play against other people over the internet or against the game itself.\n\n\"I have personally so much love for the college football series, and even though it's not called 'NCAA Football,' it's kind of the spiritual successor to that series,\" Nutzman said. \"So having it come back after 11 years away when it meant so much to me growing up and meant so much to my love of sports growing up -- it just feels so awesome.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The new EA Sports College Football 25 video game is living up to the hype.\n\nPlayers who pre-ordered the deluxe edition or MVP bundle gained access to the game on Monday, while the standard edition released Friday.\n\nWith all new gameplay animations and the revival of nostalgic modes like Dynasty and Road to Glory, this could be one of the biggest games of the year.\n\nNew gameplay\n\nPerhaps the most important part of a sports video game is the gameplay. Players want the perfect balance between fun and realism. Electronic Arts dedicated a lot of resources to adding all-new blocking, tackling and running animations to capture the excitement of real-life college football games.\n\nOn top of that, EA has incorporated a few first-time features into College Football 25 like the revamped passing mechanics, wear and tear system, stadium pulse, and over 80 new player abilities.\n\nWith hundreds of new gameplay animations, players can mimic the styles of their favorite athletes and have an authentic gameplay experience.\n\nDynasty\n\nThe fan favorite Dynasty mode has made its return in College Football 25 with multiple new features that add to the experience.\n\nIn this mode, users can become a head coach, offensive coordinator or defensive coordinator at any college they choose. Each team has a prestige star rating that directly impacts the difficulty of the first season as a coach.\n\nFor example, when playing as Alabama, it will be easier to compete for a championship right away and recruit top-ranked high school athletes. If players start out with a lower-tier program like UAB or South Alabama, it will take some time to turn the team into a championship contender.\n\nRecruiting is more complex and has numerous features that add to the realism of recruiting in modern college football. When viewing the prospect list, there are a variety of things to pay attention to, like \"deal breakers.\" These are the wants and needs of a recruit that affect the likelihood of them coming to a school.\n\nIt is important to use recruiting hours wisely in order to remain among a recruit's top teams. Users can scout players, offer scholarships and schedule visits to try and sell an athlete on joining their program.\n\nIn the offseason, new options become available for coaches like recruiting out of the transfer portal and viewing job offers from other programs. Users can play up to 30 seasons in dynasty mode, invite friends to compete against and create custom conferences, all of which gives users the dynasty experience they desire.\n\nIt's hard to find flaws in Dynasty mode. This feature is the main reason fans begged for a new college football game, and it has more depth to match the newness of the real-life game. The fact that Dynasty was great in previous games but has improved even more is why fans are ecstatic about its return.\n\nRoad to Glory\n\nIn Road to Glory, players can start their collegiate career by selecting a star rating to begin with. EA has added brand new customization options for the player character, including position, archetype, appearance and recruiting needs.\n\nA player will have the opportunity to view teams that are interested in their avatar at national signing day. Some programs will start the athlete immediately, while others will have players pay their dues as a backup or third string.\n\nA career is in the palm of players' hands. As a college athlete, it is up to a user to manage their GPA, leadership, health, training and NIL deals. Throughout the season, a player may receive text messages from teammates, coaches and others. How one responds to these text messages will directly impact the player character's future.\n\nRoad to Glory effectively immerses the player and is another outstanding returning feature.\n\nUltimate Team\n\nThe game mode that became famous in Madden has made its way into College Football 25. In Ultimate Team, players aim to build the best team possible. Users can assemble a squad by collecting player cards in challenges or earning rewards from gaining XP. Then, the cards can be placed into a lineup that can be used in Ultimate Team.\n\nOther ways that players can accumulate cards are purchasing packs at the item shop or using coins to buy cards off the auction house.\n\nWith new player cards releasing consistently, there is always a scramble to add the newest players to the collection.\n\nA game mode like Ultimate Team is often seen as a greedy money grab in video games, as the best way to get great players is spending money on packs each week. For that reason, this may not be everyone's favorite game mode, but it gives people the opportunity to play with past and present players.\n\nRoad to the College Football Playoff\n\nThis is EA's competitive mode where players can choose a team and move up the ranks by defeating online players. The main goal is to reach the top of the leaderboard and make the College Football Playoff. Road to the College Football Playoff is great for players that want to compete online and see where they stack up against the best the world has to offer.\n\nFinal remarks\n\nCollege Football 25 has received high praise from athletes, celebrities and content creators, and some people online claim to have requested time off from their job in order to play with their dynasty teams. After years of development, EA has created a game that captures the excitement of college football and feeds fans' fantasies of putting on a jersey and joining their favorite players on the field.", "source": {"uri": "thecrimsonwhite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Crimson White"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_mason@thecrimsonwhite.com", "name": "Matthew Mason", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Realism (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Player character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama_at_Birmingham", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Alabama at Birmingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Alabama_Jaguars_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Alabama Jaguars football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scholarship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grading in education"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://thecrimsonwhite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EA-SPORTS\u2122-College-Football-25_20240715150249-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Once the NCAA adopted a policy based on name, image and likeness, it opened the door for athletes to be paid. And ultimately, the return of a fan favorite video game.\n\nEA Sports announced the return of a college football game in February 2021. The news rang throughout X -- then called Twitter -- and the chatter among my friends began.\n\nThe road ahead was a long wait and included EA delaying the release. Through every turn over the past few years, the topic of the new game has constantly come up among my close friends, always followed by resounding, \"I can't wait.\"\n\nThat long, over a decade long wait, has finally come to fruition.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It was a glimpse back at my childhood and the love I once had for a video game that catapulted my interest not only in college football, but sports.\n\nAs soon as the game loaded, I knew what I had to do. My roommate and I hopped right into a game. I played as Virginia Tech, my alma mater, as he loaded in as Virginia to get a sense of the Commonwealth Clash.\n\nNo, Metallica's Enter Sandman isn't in the game. But EA Sports instead uses a generic rock song that certainly has similarity.\n\nThe game was everything I had hoped for and we got a good taste of what was to come in the countless hours ahead of playing the game.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nHow EA Sports worked to depict UVa, Virginia Tech in new video game\n\nAfter giving up a quick touchdown to my roommate, I got the ball and on my first offensive snap, took it 76 yards to the house with Hokies running back Bhayshul Tuten. An accomplishment I've seen in person many times, but for now for the first time on a video game.\n\nWe were so back.\n\nThe anticipation for myself and my friends has been borderline unbearable. As new trailers or deep dives have been released on the EA Sports College YouTube channel, we've all tuned in to check out any bit of the game ahead of the time we could.\n\nI imagine my close friends, comprised of nine Virginia Tech graduates, represent many college sports fans in their 20s who have a slew of childhood memories playing college football games. We have a very active group chat that was once used primarily for playing Fortnite, but the switch to CFB25 is in full effect.\n\nMy friends were mostly Sports Media and Analytics majors at Tech and it shows. There were already intricate plans for our online dynasty; from which conferences would be used and a draft to decide teams.\n\nGrowing up, I can recall the joy of playing NCAA Football 2003 on the PlayStation 2. It was one of first games I played as a kid with my dad and featured Oregon's Joey Harrington on the cover.\n\nMy most played NCAA Football game was certainly '07 with USC's Reggie Bush on the cover, a game my brother, 19, credits to his initial love for the game we lost for so long.\n\nFor many college football fans, NCAA Football 14 with Michigan's Denard Robinson on the cover, represents a decade long wait for another game. The last NCAA Football game I logged a ton of hours on as a kid was NCAA Football 13 with Baylor's Robert Griffin III and Oklahoma State's Barry Sanders.\n\nAs for 14, the resell value was through the roof as people wanted to play the most recent EA Sports release. But 14 always popped up during college. A couple of my closest friends owned the game and held on to their PS2 only to play the one game, in addition to some other fallen titles such as NCAA Basketball 10 and MVP 07: NCAA Baseball.\n\nMaybe one day there will be a return, but the need for NCAA Football 14 has ended and the 11-year wait is over. College Football 25 is here.\n\nJackson Didlake\n\njdidlake@timesdispatch.com\n\nX @diidlake\n\nJackson Didlake\n\nSports Reporter\n\nAuthor email Follow Jackson Didlake Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Clark, a devotee of the series and NHL writer for ESPN.com, told The Seattle Times on Monday.\n\nIt's a holiday steeped in nostalgia -- in midsummer marathons on prehistoric PlayStations, in triple-option offenses and players lost to time, in critical recruiting battles for fictional five-star safeties, in regional conferences (remember them?) and in-state rivalries.\n\n\"NCAA Football 14\" had 20 predecessors, dating to \"Bill Walsh College Football\" in 1993. It also had a frenzied following, a generation of football fans who developed dynasties -- chiseling national champions out of small-school Cinderellas.\n\n\"For me it was really cool, because I got to see really good teams and players that in 1998, in Minneapolis, I wasn't ever going to see play until the bowl game,\" said Dave Southorn, 42, who later covered Boise State football for The Idaho Statesman and The Athletic. \"You got this really good view of the college football landscape through that game.\n\n\"That really helped me, to be frank, as I was figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I was like, 'Oh, this is cool.' I knew things that others didn't. Everyone was talking about Michigan or whoever. I was like, 'Have you heard of Tulane?' \"\n\nClark, likewise, celebrated the annual summer release with a weeklong marathon, as he and a friend staged a sport-wide tournament (modeled after the UEFA Champions League in European soccer) to establish supremacy.\n\n\"We did our own statistical tracking [of games],\" said Clark, 39, who traces the tournament to his high-school years in Florida from 1998 to 2002. \"We were absolute nerds about it, and we totally own it. We absolutely own it.\"\n\nConcluded Clark, who lives in Seattle: \"This is what we would do from 4 o'clock in the afternoon to 2 o'clock in the morning every day for a week.\"\n\nDecades later, the arrival of \"EA Sports College Football 25\" has attracted a similar response, flooding social-media feeds with flea flickers and stadium shots and shaking student sections. As 247Sports college football reporter and podcaster Bud Elliott posted Tuesday on X: \"The EA Sports College Football release has completely upstaged media days buzz. Search trends [online] are wild. To the point where talking college football on a college football show instead of talking about the video game is legit bad business.\"\n\nThe business of college football is also reflected in the game, as players must maneuver NIL deals and the transfer portal to retain top talent. An athlete's academics, leadership skills, health, training and brand all must be monitored.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nIndeed, a whole lot happened in the 4,025 days between the releases of \"NCAA Football 14\" and \"EA Sports College Football 25.\"\n\nFor the sport, the franchise ... and its fans.\n\n\"The last time this game came out, I wasn't yet engaged,\" Southorn said. \"I've been married for nine years now. That's how long it's been for me.\"\n\nJoked Clark on Monday morning, in a similar situation: \"When 1 o'clock rolls around, my wife understands that it was a great run for our marriage. We had a lot of great years. We put championships in the rafters. But I'm a ghost to her now, and she knows that, God bless her.\"\n\nSouthorn may soon count among the game-playing ghosts. The University of Colorado alum, who now handles content and communications for a hospital system in Idaho, requested off work Friday to reignite a former flame.\n\n\"Daycare is going to come in clutch,\" said the 42-year-old father and Carnation native. \"I'll get up, take [daughter Kennedy] to day care in the morning. Maybe I'll swing by the doughnut shop and grab something, and then just settle in. I'll probably order a pizza or something at lunch, because I don't want to move.\n\n\"I know I'm in a boat with a whole lot of people. When you get to 40ish and you've got kids, you don't have as much time. But I know I'm literally going to find ways to make time. Because we all need something.\"\n\nThis game, for some, is more than a silly aside -- or a time machine to a tournament lasting until 2 a.m. It's not just nostalgia wrapped in new graphics and updated uniforms.\n\nIt's also a referendum on college football's deepening divide, on the parity diluted by super conferences and media-rights money. It's an individual objection -- a place where Army and Akron and Appalachian State can overwhelm Alabama, where Washington State can pummel its former Pac-12 partners into apologetic pieces.\n\nIt's a place where former Notre Dame and Wake Forest quarterback Sam Hartman -- whose Demon Deacons never defeated Clemson in his five seasons as the starter -- can topple the Tigers, 105-34, as they did Tuesday.\n\n\"Just blowing off some steam...\" Hartman posted, along with a screen shot, on social media.\n\nIt's a place where anything is still possible, provided you can play.\n\n\"I think maybe in the back of our lizard brains, you have some control over it now. You can make the Cinderella story happen,\" Southorn said. \"You can build someone up, where realistically it probably wouldn't happen [in the current era of college football] because of NIL and conference affiliation. You can return it to the way it used to be and feel like college football is a little more even or fair. I think that's a big part of it.\"\n\n(c)2024 The Seattle Times\n\nVisit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_vorel@gazette.com", "name": "Mike Vorel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walsh_College_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Walsh College Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "247Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_transfer_portal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA transfer portal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_Statesman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Idaho Statesman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane_Green_Wave_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tulane Green Wave football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise_State_Broncos_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boise State Broncos football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_section", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Student section"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowl game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

In addition to improving their player's performances on the field, they'll also need to strengthen their brand, boost their bond with their coach and teammates, and make sure that they don't fall behind in class.\n\nRelated\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 Burning Questions\n\nThe following guide will aim to answer all of the most frequently asked questions about EA Sports College Football 25.\n\nThe latter is especially important, as if a player's GPA falls below 2.0, they'll no longer be considered for selection. With this in mind, players will need to ensure that they keep up with their studies, especially when there's a big test coming up. If they work hard enough, it's even possible to graduate early in EA Sports College Football 25.\n\nHow to Graduate Early in College Football 25\n\nClose\n\nTo graduate early in Road to Glory mode, College Football 25 players will need to finish their junior year with a 3.7 GPA or higher. Doing so will allow them to wrap up their time in academia after three years instead of four, at which point, they'll be free to continue into their senior year without having to worry about exams or retire from college football altogether and progress to the NFL. The latter will end their Road to Glory playthrough immediately, unlocking the option to transfer their RTG player over to Madden 25. If players opt to carry on into their senior year, they'll no longer have to dedicate any of their energy toward studying, allowing them to focus more on improving their footballing ability, teamwork, and brand.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the higher education system in America, a junior year refers to a student's third year at college or university. In most instances, students typically spend four years as an undergraduate, with these usually being referred to as one's freshman (first), sophomore (second), junior (third), and senior (fourth) years.\n\nHow to Increase GPA in College Football 25\n\nClose\n\nThe best way to increase a player's GPA in College Football 25 is to spend enough energy on studying so as to always be prepared when a big test rolls around. Midterms and finals take place on weeks eight and fifteen respectively, so players should study accordingly. Every now and again, they'll also get messages come through to their phone, some of which will be related to their studies. In these instances, choosing study-centric responses will provide a small GPA boost, which, together with the boost given from acing tests, should make it fairly easy to secure a 3.7 grade point average by the end of the third year of Road to Glory mode.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25\n\nDeveloper(s) EA Orlando\n\nPublisher(s) EA\n\nPlatform(s) PS5 , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased July 19, 2024", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_bowen@gamerant.com", "name": "Tom Bowen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grading in education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_25", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL 25"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Undergraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic_Study", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic Study", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 28}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/college-football-25-rtg-graduate-early-featured-2200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 2935, "textEnd": 2942}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The fear was that College Football 25 would simply be a carbon copy of Madden, with the only difference being different players and teams.\n\nAdmittedly, there are a lot of similarities between Madden and College Football 25's gameplay, but that's somewhat expected -- it's the same sport, after all. Fortunately, Road to Glory and Dynasty modes feel different enough from Madden's Superstar and Franchise modes.\n\nBalancing college life and your time on the field in Road to Glory is delicate, while Dynasty strangely feels a lot more inviting to newer players than Madden despite the depth (and importance) of recruiting.\n\nOverall, the only carbon copy of Madden comes in Ultimate Team, which is to be expected and, frankly, welcomed given how much attention goes into EA Sports' money-spinning mode every year -- it's time other modes were given their chance to shine.\n\nWithout a doubt, Dynasty is where College Football 25 truly excels. Starting a coaching career, whether immediately diving in as a Head Coach or choosing to stick with the Offense or Defense initially, feels a lot more rewarding than Madden's Franchise mode ever has over the past decade.\n\nIn comparison to College teams, NFL outfits are often a lot more established, and after only a short while, you can quickly turn any team into a genuine contender -- and while that remains possible in Dynasty, depending on your choice, it's certainly a lot more of a long-term goal.\n\nI started my Dynasty as an Offensive Coordinator with the Washington State Cougars, a middle-of-the-road PAC-12 side, and it's been a hell of a ride. There have been plenty of thrilling matches and late comebacks, pushed by the new Adaptive AI feature, and the fight to secure top players in recruitment has kept me occupied.\n\nI've started celebrating when a Bye Week appears, giving me more time to focus on recruitment and immediately see how my efforts have paid off. There's no better feeling than making the cut in a five-star recruit's top picks -- though lower-ranked recruits are just as critical to bolster your depth.\n\nDynasty isn't perfect, though, particularly with clunky menus that have led me to offer Scholarships to players I didn't want to and making it impossible to quickly check a player's stats or my schedule, but it's certainly good enough to keep me busy.\n\nThe main struggle I have with College Football 25 is working out whether this is a genuine step forward for EA or whether I'm influenced by the fact it's been over a decade since NCAA 14.\n\nCollege Football 25 was always going to sell well, but how will the situation look next year in another installment? Will we be sucked into the same rinse-and-repeat cycle EA Sports has cornered itself into with Madden and EA FC?", "source": {"uri": "dotesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dot Esports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_challies@dotesports.com", "name": "Josh Challies", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diving (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Early access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Cougars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington State Cougars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bye (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic_Study", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic Study", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CFB25_HomefieldAdvantage_16x9_Watermark.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Thanks to the extended wait, fans are treated to quite the leap and a game filled with plenty of fresh ideas rather than a Madden retread. It's easily the most exciting football game in years.\n\nWhile College Football 25 doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to how a football game plays, there are a few important tweaks to gameplay. For example, passing now defaults to a system similar to Madden's skill-based passing, as there's a bar that factors into your power and accuracy. Classic passing is still available in the options if you are resistant to change, but I quite enjoyed the new system after a small adjustment.\n\nSimilarly, kicking is also a held button press that can get very inaccurate if held for too long. Players can even expect to occasionally miss a PAT if you're using a less-skilled team. In general, the game keeps you on your feet as, just in real-life college football, mistakes are more frequent and games are more unpredictable as a result. It's a great way to differentiate it from the polished, more structured play in Madden while staying true to the sport it is emulating.\n\nAnother aspect that really puts over the collegiate atmosphere is the in-game presentation. From mascots and marching bands to real-life traditions, games have a totally different vibe. There are a ton of lovely touches that sports fans will notice, such as turnover celebrations and stadium traditions. You'll see the bulldog's dog house in Georgia, for example, and that's just one of many small touches that make this game really special.\n\nThe main offline mode is Dynasty, which is an in-depth career mode where you can either start out as a head coach or a coordinator. It's up to you to decide if you want to transform a smaller school into a contender or take on the pressure of being a powerhouse right from the bat. The real difference from Madden's franchise mode is the in-depth recruiting system, which has you trying to win over top prospects. It's a huge focus in the mode and gives it a really distinct feel. Sure, you can streamline it if you just want to play football, but you'll get the most out of it if you're willing to dive into menus and go deep into recruitment.\n\nFor those who want to spend more time on the field, the Road to Glory mode is your best bet as you control one player and take them through their collegiate career. Balancing school work and athletics is on display as you'll have to stay academically eligible and spend time studying rather than purely just working out or boosting your popularity. The mode takes advantage of NIL deals as well and feels like the best example of what life as a student-athlete is really like for college football stars.\n\nFootball Ultimate Team also arrives, with plenty of offline challenges and plenty of reasons to go online. One nice aspect is that EA is also celebrating the past decade they've missed by adding some former college stars into this mode, so you can get cards of players from the past as well. There's also a ranked online mode called Road to the College Football Playoff, which has you going up against other players online -- gaining more points for upsets over higher-tiered opponents. It's a fun way to structure a ranked mode and gives players reasons to play more than just Georgia and top-ranked programs.\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 Review: Final Verdict\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 was certainly worth the wait. It's the most fun I've had in a football game in years and has a distinct feel that makes it more than just Madden with collegiate players and teams. I can't wait to see where the series goes from here and am so glad it is finally back.\n\nSCORE: 9/10\n\nAs ComingSoon's review policy explains, a score of 9 equates to \"Excellent.\" Entertainment that reaches this level is at the top of its type.

Yes, we get the usual graphical updates, a few tweaks here and there, and maybe even some tech with fancy names that simulate realism. All of these are welcome additions, but they don't really break the mold. In a way, most new iterations of Madden and other similar games feel like a re-release. But that's not the case for EA Sports College Football 25. With realistic physics, top-notch simulation features, and two new addictive game modes, even non-football fans will have a hard time putting the controller and the ball down.\n\nWhile I'm not a hardcore football expert, I've played some NFL games on and off through the years and understand the basics. However, for those of you who are somewhat new players to the modern era of football games, I can tell you EA Sports College Football 25 doesn't punish you for not knowing the sport. On the contrary, it takes your hand and leads you into every intricate play so you can kick off your career as a coach, a freshman, or someone else.\n\nMost of the time I spent in EA Sports College Football 25, and what I'll likely keep doing for weeks to come is Road to Glory. See, I never thought a sports game could manifest anything remotely close to immersive storytelling. But allow me to tell you the tale of my athlete, Chris P. Bacon. And yes, that is his actual name. Anyway, I began my Road to Glory playthrough as a balanced player. I didn't want to be completely ready for some field time. Instead, I wanted to start as someone who'd earn his spot eventually. And so I did.\n\nRoad to Glory allows you to customize a character, assign them a position, choose a team, and live an almost realistic freshman life -- minus the pressure of joining a frat house, of course. But in all seriousness, this game mode is quite deep, which I wasn't expecting in a sports game. After creating your athlete, it's up to you to climb the ranks of your team, earn field time, and lead your team to glory. How do you do that? In many ways. You have to practice weekly, earn your team members' trust, including your coach, and even gather followers.\n\nThe great thing about RtG is the little details. Since you're, first and foremost, a student, that GPA can't go down. If it is too low, say goodbye to your football dreams. Like in real life, you have to juggle your studies with your sport. It doesn't go too deep as to ask you to write a paper on whatever subject you have the most. But it gives you a few weekly energy points, and you need to split them. Will you train to gain skill points to improve your athlete's abilities or spend your energy to raise your leadership, thus earning the trust of your team? It is a constant struggle that really immerses you in the college football experience.\n\nHowever, my absolute favorite part about this game mode was making my way up through the ranks. After you earn enough trust from your coach, you can have a Position Battle against other players. Since I started as HB3, I had to face two other Halfbacks to get more field time. After one season, I managed to become HB1, thus always having field time. However, new players can challenge you as well, and you need to bring your A-game. You can bet your Heisman trophy that I never let someone named Brad steal my spot. And then again, that's part of the authenticity EA Sports was going for.\n\nOne thing I can say, though, is that Position Battles got quite repetitive. After three seasons, I had the same challenges, which were just training exercises with an added competition. They aren't bad to learn the game, but I would've loved more variety. However, as variety goes, there's plenty. You get a few messages from your advisors and classmates and even get a few choices that can affect your week. Go to a party, and your GPA will decrease. Avoid going out with your team, as they won't trust you much.\n\nLastly, there is something that might overwhelm a few players: explanations. In a way, EA Sports College Football 25 tried to add a few RPG-like elements because, for whatever reason, every single game of this decade needs a system like that. Each athlete has stats that help them perform better on the field. While most of the names are self-explanatory, others left me confused. In the end, I focused on having all my stats in green because that color showed my athlete was good. Still, newcomers might not enjoy the depth CFB 25 is trying to show off due to the lack of clear explanations.\n\nBesides Road to Glory, EA Sports College Football 25 features other game modes that other players will enjoy. Another long-anticipated one is Dynasty, which lets you coach a team, manage it, and take it to the top. Although it was bad, it just wasn't my cup of tea. After immersing myself in RtG, I couldn't move to another mode so easily. Still, people who like to have full control of a team in and out of the field will love this mode. I didn't delve much into it, but I can tell you the roster mechanics and managing systems are on point and extremely smooth to use, even for someone who wasn't into it.\n\nFurthermore, you have Ultimate Team, which lets you assemble a team with whoever you want from the roster, and Road to the College Playoff, a mode featuring three-minute matches against other players. Overall, College Football 25 has enough things to keep you occupied. Even if you decide to stick to just one game mode. Personally, I don't see myself playing anything else besides Road to Glory, but that's just me. You'll likely find an in-depth football simulator here that'll keep you entertained for hours.\n\nSpeaking of in-depth things, I have to hand it to the people behind the controls, physics, and other simulation features. One of the things you'll hear everyone talking about is the Wear & Tear system. This one is more prominent in Dynasty and Road to Glory. As you play, you'll see how fatigue affects your athlete. Take my halfback, for example. After running too much in one week, that will affect his performance. This happens with all positions, though. You better watch your QB's arm.\n\nAnother commendable thing is how great the tackling physics are, to a video game extent. Players clipping through each other is a thing of the past, and College Football 25 emulates tackles almost perfectly. You even have many responsive moves to avoid them or even block other players. This adds another layer of immersion to the already excellent football simulator CFB 25 is going for. However, that doesn't mean the game is without its faults.\n\nI experienced a couple of infinite-loop scenarios and visual glitches. During Road to Glory, the start of a new season would never finish loading. While I fixed it by reloading my game, it happened more than I would've liked. At the same time, I felt the longer the season went, the more my game took to load. It wasn't something that took minutes, but it was noticeable, and a few times, it broke that pacing I had as I jumped from one week to another.\n\nThe visual part of EA Sports College Football 25 was contrasting, to say the least. On the one hand, you have almost realistic-looking graphics, especially when looking at players. For instance, the reflection of my teammates is visible on my character's helmet. On the other hand, after decades of ruling the sports landscape, EA hasn't been able to nail down NPCs. I had a few instances of the head of some viewers clipping through the chest of another or even a few cheerleaders' hairstyles not loading properly. Since I reviewed this on an Xbox Series S, I'm unsure if it is hardware-related, but they were a bit jarring and constant throughout my playthrough.\n\nThe audio was excellent and captured the youthful college vibe perfectly. You have your marching bands in the background before each play and even the sound of your team's mascot playing over if you're on your home field. The commentators were also great and almost didn't feel too repetitive. However, the sound effects steal the show. Hearing players clash as they tackle each other or the simple sound of catching the ball mid-air was extremely enjoyable.\n\nMany will look at EA Sports College Football 25 and think it is yet another football game with shiny new graphics and a few roster additions. Thankfully, it is much more than that. It is an intricate and deep simulator that offers an almost authentic college football experience. Furthermore, it caters to all types of players by giving them different game modes capable of attracting even those who've never played the sport or a game of this type once.\n\nWhile it has a few technical issues, they aren't too big to deter someone from playing. On the contrary, once you get past them with enough patience, you'll live a true virtual football experience. Also, take this from someone fairly new to the genre: it is quite welcoming to rookies. If starting your virtual football career never crossed your mind, it should. College Football 25 is a fantastic starting point and the genre's comeback we've all been waiting for.", "source": {"uri": "thenerdstash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nerd Stash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julio_la_pine@thenerdstash.com", "name": "Julio La Pine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sports video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Physics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grading in education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simulation video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfback_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halfback (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Realism (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_band", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marching band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/College-Football-25-Review.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

The excitement was uncontrollable when early access began on July 16, with over 700,000 players online simultaneously. This enthusiasm comes ahead of the game's official launch on July 19. However, like any major release, it has faced its share of server crashes, malfunctions, and game-breaking glitches.\n\nOne particular point of contention is a NSFW error with Colorado's mascot Chip. The Buffalo roaming the sidelines appears to have some extra character in an unflattering way here. It certainly will be part of the early fixes needed for the game. Also, there are players going up 20-30 feet in the air after scoring a touchdown.\n\nEA's Ultimate Team mode is often criticized for being a pay-to-win model that benefits those willing to spend more money. This criticism gained traction when a pack glitch provided fortunate players with overpowered squads, highlighting the perceived imbalance in the game. The players who were down on their luck and less talented became stars with a 98 rating overnight.\n\nNostalgia plays a significant role in the reception of EA Sports College Football 25. Many fans fondly recall the simpler times of their youth, when the previous installments of the game were part of their lives. The announcement of the franchise's return sparked a wave of nostalgia, making it easy for fans to overlook the complexities of modern gaming.\n\nAfter eleven years, EA Sports has successfully revived the essence of the old games, while seamlessly integrating modern updates.The experience was so engaging that it feels like a trip down memory lane, now enriched by a deeper understanding of the sport. EA Sports' decision to build the game from scratch and delay its release by a year has paid off, delivering a polished and satisfying product.\n\nDespite being aware of EA Sports' reputation for microtransactions and gameplay issues in other titles, This game is filled with cautious optimism, but has already won over the masses who've waited years to get to this point.\n\nTravis Hunter slams Colorado's offensive line over EA Sports College Football 25\n\nThe game boasts stunning graphics and a remarkably realistic representation of each school. Most importantly, it recaptures the spirit of the beloved older versions. The original series ended due to the NCAA's restrictions on player compensation for their name, image, and likeness. Since then, college football has undergone significant changes, including NIL deals and unlimited transfers. The game incorporates these new elements while preserving the core aspects that fans adored.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of EA Sports College Football 25 is its broad appeal. Hardcore gamers will find plenty of depth and customization options, while casual players can enjoy a more streamlined experience. This versatility ensures that everyone can find something to enjoy. In an era where college football faces challenges and uncertainties, with divisions among conferences and fan bases, this game stands as a celebration of the sport.

It's awesome.\n\nTo recruit good players in the new College Football 25 video game from EA Sports, you must be willing to engage in activities most adults would find odd. You will press a button to scour the social media of a high schooler. You will send a direct message to that high schooler. You will try to make that high schooler interested enough in you that they will accept when you offer to book them a visit to see you. Your significant other will think it's extremely weird that you stay up doing this until well after midnight.\n\nAs the head coach of the Sun Belt Conference's Texas State Bobcats, I spent the night courting players to join my nascent juggernaut in the just-released video game. And, yes, those are real actions in the game: To woo a four-star linebacker, you can research their social media, send them DMs, and hopefully get them to take an official visit so that they might commit to your school.\n\nIt is the franchise's first release since July 2013, when it went by the name NCAA Football. The series disappeared after a UCLA basketball player sued over the inclusion of his likeness in a different video game. This led to a major legal defeat and NCAA Football's cancellation, since the game studio could not compensate players for their appearance in video games under NCAA eligibility rules. But we live in a new world now, with fresh gaming consoles and fresh player compensation rules in college sports. The vast majority of players in the 134-team Football Bowl Subdivision received $600 payments to appear in the game, which came out this week.\n\nIn its last iteration, this was a beloved game. The long layoff made this week's release perhaps the most anticipated sports drop in American video game history. The game is indeed a blast, and I have logged nearly a full day's worth of playtime since getting it on Monday. It has many fun features like detailed, diverse playbooks, accurate marching band songs and stadium pageantry, and a (sometimes way too real) recruiting engine. Fans of all 134 teams can be filled with pride when they see their teams' fields, uniforms, and traditions depicted in silky video game graphics. But the real joy of CFB 25 lies in building a powerhouse football program from the ground up.\n\nI consider myself one of the more progressive members of the college football press corps. I have written for years about the rot in the sport's economics. My work has been cited in congressional reports and in a National Labor Relations Board memorandum that advocated for employee status for college athletes. I think football coaches are whiners who ought to stop pissing and moaning about how today's athletes have made their jobs so difficult.\n\nConfession time, then: College Football 25 has laid bare a manipulative, anti-labor beast within me. As the leader of digital Texas State, I am everything I have claimed I want to destroy. I lie to high school athletes to get them to play for my team. When they are dissatisfied with their playing time, I pretend I will give them more, urging them not to transfer to another school. Then I keep them stapled to the bench. I also urge bad players to scram from my program, which is just the kind of behavior I've called out in these very pages. I show complete disregard for my players' health, keeping my stars on the field even when the game informs me that my 19-year-old players are dangerously close to getting injured. I am a bad person, and I do not regret it, because it will pay off when I complete the unthinkable and lead my Bobcats to a national championship.\n\nCollege Football 25 is an unusual sports video game. There's no analog for such a beloved sports franchise -- one that sold very well, I've been told over the years -- to simply vanish for 11 years without any sort of replacement entering the market. That was a result of college sports' warped economics, and it had two effects. One, it left college football obsessives lusting after the game in a way NFL fans do not lust after the Madden games that this same studio releases year after year. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, and I know several college fans who bought the latest-generation gaming consoles this week just so that they could play the new game. The last version came out in the days of the Xbox 360.\n\nThose same college sports economics also make the game unlike anything else. Managing a college football roster is nasty work in real life, and EA Sports had to honor that without making such a salacious game that schools and conferences wouldn't want to be in it. Everyone knows that asshole coaches all over the country are prone to pushing underachieving players off their rosters to open up scholarship slots for other players. In the game, you can \"encourage transfers\" if you've signed more than the 85 allowed players. (EA does not ask you if you want to mimic a real-life coach by cussing a player out, excluding him from social settings, or referring to him as a lousy piece of luggage.) In the game, you can offer only 35 scholarships, but if you decide you no longer want a player, you can simply remove him from your recruiting board and free up the offer you'd spent on him. (EA does not ask if you want to issue real \"committable\" scholarship offers or fake conditional offers to players who aren't truly \"a take\" for your school, in real-world football parlance.)\n\nActual gameplay nods to real life, too. Some players have traits that will essentially make them a headcase if they're playing in a difficult road environment. (My kicker missed a game-winning 44-yard field goal at Alabama because he could not stop shaking as I lined up the kick.) You can monitor your players' health during the game via a \"wear and tear\" monitor, and if you are like me, you can force your college football players to play right up until the point of a broken bone that will knock them out of action for weeks. College football coaches who don't look out for their players' well-being are the scum of the sport -- and in this game, I am exactly like them. That's just the cost of building a great program.\n\nThis would only work in college football, a sport that deifies coaches and treats players as expendable. After all, there are lots of decent players out there, but there are only a few truly great coaches. The coaches make the big money because they find the good players, develop more of them, and run off the bad players.\n\nGamers don't care about the fake video game salary their coach gets paid, but CFB 25 has different ways of making a successful gamer head coach feel good. I've been building up my skill tree so that I can become just as persuasive a recruiter as Georgia's Kirby Smart or Texas' Steve Sarkisian. Stadium attendance in the game is dynamic, so I felt great joy when I lost just one game last season at Texas State and gradually saw my team's stadium go from half-empty to full of proud Bobcat faithful.\n\nThis style of program management is nothing to relish. My digital athletes deserve more respect than I give them, and my leadership style would, in the real world, be a lawsuit waiting to happen. But we all make sacrifices in the name of careerism. And if there's one thing worth compromising one's principles over, why shouldn't it be bringing national football glory to the good virtual people of San Marcos, Texas?", "source": {"uri":

First announced back in February 2021, it has been a long road to reach this day filled with enormous excitement from a fanbase that has grown tired of Madden.\n\nThe biggest hurdle for EA was securing the names, images, and likeness (NIL) deals for players, allowing fans to score touchdowns with their favorite athletes. With that secured, the game began to take shape and has finally hit the shelves. Can it truly live up to the fan expectations and hype, or are the fears of it being the same as Madden accurate?\n\nReviewed on Xbox Series X. Review copy provided by publisher.\n\nThe biggest fear about College Football 25 was that it would just be Madden with different stadiums, uniforms, and player names. Let's start by putting that fear to rest. College Football 25 is its own standalone game with a truly unique feel. While the sport is obviously the same, college football has different rules from the NFL, and these are well-represented in College Football 25. However, the most important aspect is the gameplay.\n\nPlayer movement, tackling, throwing, and even blocking is a huge step up from Madden and so different that if you try to utilize your Madden muscle memory, you will struggle to get results.\n\nCollege Football 25's in-game mechanics are a true breath of fresh air, showcasing what EA can produce when not bogged down by an annual cycle. This game is so fresh and new that it can rekindle the love of the game in even the most cynical Madden player.\n\nThe biggest difference on the field is that while speed is important in College Football 25, it is not the game-changer it is in Madden. OVR actually matters, as offensive lines can get shredded by more technical or stronger pass rushers, and unaware linebackers can't suddenly appear with no-look interceptions. Perhaps best of all, being on the road in a rowdy atmosphere adds genuine difficulty to the game. Hot routes can't always be communicated to receivers, play art becomes wavy and unrecognizable, and receiver icons disappear.\n\nThese changes may be frustrating for long-term Madden players when first encountered, but they work brilliantly in differentiating the game from Madden and create an enormous leap forward on the field.\n\nNFL playbooks have been getting more homogeneous over the last few years, as teams all run basically the same plays. This cannot be said for college football, where old-school veer and flexbone football contend with air raid spread systems.\n\nCollege Football 25 has done a terrific job in creating an enormously diverse yet effective range of playbooks and play styles for everyone.\n\nWhile you can change your playbook in Dynasty Mode and Ultimate Team, for quick play and head-to-heads, you can't. This keeps every school within its identity and should reduce \"meta\" play. While Ultimate Team players are likely to coalesce into a handful of styles, there should be enough in this game to keep even the most die-hard players finding new and inventive ways of scoring touchdowns.\n\nBecause of all the new options, RPOs, screens, and double passes, you'll want to hit the practice field to get your timing, button combos, and reads right. The combination of a new feel on the field and fresh playbooks to master makes College Football 25 a refreshing experience.\n\nCollege Football 25 has a huge number of teams to pick in Dynasty mode, and while some will jump right into Ohio State or Alabama, plenty more will try to take the smallest schools to the title.\n\nThis journey is another big success for College Football 25. If you start with an LSU or Georgia, you will have a massive job juggling the five-star recruits and competing with other big teams. Most players won't do this, though, and will start far from the elite SEC teams. In that case, you can forget about recruiting even three-star players right away. You will need to carefully scout one- and two-star players, nurture their talents to make sure they don't transfer away, and be patient.\n\nWhile some big-time players can fall through the cracks (I was able to bring the #11 prospect in the nation to Boston College), the recruitment cycle feels just balanced enough between the realism of competing against elite programs and the joy of building up from a humble beginning. It won't be impossible to take Appalachian State to the College Football National Playoff Championship, but it will be a very, very long road.\n\nThe only issue with Dynasty mode is that game simulations are not always brilliant. There have been reports of players dropping games to schools they are 20+ OVR better than when simming through the games. Hopefully, this gets tweaked in future patches, as it will make those long-term projects harder to balance if you have to grind through every game.\n\nCollege Football 25 is as good as everyone hoped it would be and more. From amazing pre-match presentations at each school to a truly vibrant in-game atmosphere that speaks to the joy of college football compared to the NFL.\n\nEverything from the soundtrack (a marching band rather than Madden's usual rap and hip-hop) to the lesser prominence of Ultimate Team makes this game feel different from Madden. It's a brilliant achievement that brings the joy of sports games back. You can feel the passion that went into the game, from the intricacies of recruiting to the explosion of noise when you enter the stadium on game day.", "source": {"uri": "realsport101.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RealSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muscle memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty_(1981_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dynasty (1981 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_rush", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pass rush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexbone_formation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flexbone formation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_State_Mountaineers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appalachian State Mountaineers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_band", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marching band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Realism (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Bluff", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Bluff", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://gdm-assets.b-cdn.net/images/ncavvykf/realsport-production/ec4780bea6df1c01ad25eede5f795666a69a183f-1108x616.jpg?rect=0,17,1108,582&w=1600&h=840&fit=crop&auto=format", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

National Collegiate Athletic Association -- sent the game from EA Sports to the sidelines in 2013 after the court ruled that EA Sports, the game's publisher, had no right to use the likenesses of former college football players.\n\nSCOTUS opened the door to change in 2021 with a case that affected name, image and likeness in college sports, ruling that the NCAA violated anti-trust laws by not allowing players to make money.\n\nThe NCAA pivoted and changed their archaic rules regarding NIL and now allow players to profit from their image and name.\n\nAnd with it comes a return to video game consoles across the country as EA Sports invested $6 million, according to a New York Times report, in NIL rights alone for the rebirth of one of its premier game titles, consistently ranking in the Top 10 in sales until its demise.\n\nIt's easy to get lost in a competitive game on the console whether against a computer or that beer-swilling buddy who treats it as if each game is a win-or-die imperative.\n\n\"College Football 25\" takes what was a somewhat customizable experience and takes it to another level -- a level that includes University of Akron football players, who were among the 11,000 nationwide who received $600 and a deluxe version of the game for appearing in the game, a fun payday made possible by that 2021 SCOTUS decision.\n\nCustomization is at the heart of what makes \"College Football 25\" compelling to gamers along with a host of other features.\n\nTeam Builder, however, is key:\n\n\"Create your own college football program with customization tools on the Team Builder website.

NCAA 25 is only available on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, not on PlayStation 4 or PC. You will not be able to play College Football 25 on a PS4 or PC.\n\nThe early release date for NCAA 25 was Monday, July 18, 2024, for pre-orders, while the traditional release is on Friday, July 19. Fans can purchase the standard version for $69.99, and the deluxe edition is $99.99.\n\nYou will not be able to play NCAA 25 on your PS4 and will need to purchase the latest PlayStation or Xbox console in order to play. Placed in a similar situation, I was able to trade-in my old PlayStation 4 for credit on a PS5. Gamers looking to save even more money can look to purchase a used or refurbished PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S.\n\nAmazon, GameStop, Target and Best Buy are among the stores that accept trade-ins on PlayStation 4 or older consoles. GameStop is also running a promotion that gives consumers additional credit on trade-ins when you become a Pro member.\n\nFor example, I was able to trade-in my PlayStation 4 and purchase a used PlayStation 5 for less than $400. The cheapest new PlayStation 5 is the digital-only version which is retailing for $449.99.\n\nCollege Football 25 Release Date: The CFB Video Game Is Dropping for the 1st Time in More Than a Decade\n\nThis is the first time EA Sports is releasing a college football video game in more than a decade. The game was last released on July 9, 2013 when NCAA Football 14 came out.\n\nThanks to NIL, EA Sports was able to relaunch the college football video game series now that players can receive payment for being in the game. All players who agreed to be in NCAA 25 earned $600 and a free copy of the game. Cover athletes and ambassadors were able to sign more lucrative deals with EA Sports.\n\nYes, Cross-Play Is Available on NCAA 25, But Not for Dynasty Mode\n\nCollege Football 25 does have cross-play enabled which allows friends with different consoles to play together. Yet, this mode is not yet available for dynasty mode.\n\nThis means that fans starting an online dynasty will all need to be on the same platform (PlayStation or Xbox) in order to play together. All is not lost as cross-play is supported on NCAA 25 for the following game modes: Road to the College Football Playoff, College Football Ultimate Team and Play a Friend. This will allow those on PlayStation and Xbox to play together, just not on dynasty mode.\n\nSo, Is NCAA 25 Worth the Hype?\n\nGiven the long layoff between games, EA Sports has received a lot of praise for NCAA 25. Yet, is the game actually worth the hype it is receiving?\n\nHeavy Sports was able to play an early edition of the game and can confirm that College Football 25 is as good as advertised. There is attention to detail for every school in the game.\n\nFans of college football powerhouses like Alabama, Georgia and Ohio State will be impressed by the level of detail. Yet, Group of Five programs such South Alabama, Marshall and Kennesaw State were not slighted as just as much thought was put into their stadiums and players as well.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_adams@heavy.com", "name": "Jonathan Adams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "GameStop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-order", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pre-order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cross-platform play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Best Buy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennesaw,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kennesaw, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kennesaw, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1901146999-e1721303624240.jpg?quality=65&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 415, "textEnd": 422}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-07-09", "textStart": 1525, "textEnd": 1537}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-07-", "textStart": 340, "textEnd": 347}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

{"uri": "8230750348", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-07-17", "time": "22:39:46", "dateTime": "2024-07-17T22:39:46Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-07-17T22:39:16Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5176470875740051, "url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review", "title": "College Football 25 Review in Progress - IGN", "body": "So far dynamic matches and stellar visuals can't help the feeling that this prospect was rushed to the field too soon.\n\nAbout a week before College Football 25's play-early-if-you-give-EA-more-money release, I found myself at a friend's wedding in Texas, overhearing someone with plans to buy a brand new console just to be able to get this game. I knew the long-awaited return of an NCAA video game was going to be popular, but I didn't realize it was going to be system-selling levels of enticing. I've thought about that guy a lot as I've played College Football 25 over the last week, and about how excited he was - I wonder if he's bought it yet, and if he's having a good time, because so far my own experience as a longtime Madden player has been... mixed. The on-field action and visuals are generally stellar, but the barebones modes, awful UI, lack of tutorials, and slew of other annoyances and poor design choices have made everything else about it a pretty joyless slog so far.\n\nLet's get the good stuff out of the way first: College Football 25's presentation is light-years beyond what developer EA Orlando has been doing with Madden. You can see sweat on individual players, the lighting is exceptional, and everything pops visually in a way that Madden just doesn't. There's also just a lot more stuff to enjoy, from the unique intros for each team as they take the field to mascots dancing around when their school pulls off a big play. There's even performances from cheerleaders, school-specific cheers, and live cuts to the crowd reacting to what's happening in real time. College Football 25 captures a lot of the pageantry and tradition that makes college football unique, and that makes it feel unique, too. I hope some of this added focus on presentation will make it over to Madden in the next few years.\n\nThe other major difference is that it just feels faster and a whole lot more fluid. Plays happen more quickly, there's less delay between them, and players feel like they're moving more nimbly, too. When real-life players make the transition from college to the NFL, you'll often hear them talk about having to adapt to the faster speed of the NFL game - here, though, it's the other way around, and it makes College Football 25 feel dynamic in a way that Madden doesn't.\n\nThere are also a lot of nice little touches throughout. I like how selecting your favorite team (which you do by choosing their helmet, not a name from a list) decorates the main menu with photos of their mascot, stadium, and other cool, team-specific things like ticket stubs, or how the loading screens and on-field play art looks like they've been drawn by hand. College Football 25 has personality. Oh, and unlike Madden 24, there's no menu lag. It's the little things.\n\nAs far as modes go, though, things are a little barebones. You've got your standard Play Now feature for jumping into a quick game; Road to the College Football playoffs, which is an online ranked mode where you'll pick a team and try to guide them to a National Championship; Road to Glory, which lets you create your own player and pilot them through their college career; Dynasty, where you'll helm one of College Football 25's 134 (!) teams as either a head coach or an offensive or defensive coordinator; Practice and Mini-Games modes; and finally, College Ultimate Team (CUT), the college version of Madden Ultimate Team, which is still a slot machine masquerading as a trading card game that will almost assuredly make EA hundreds of millions of dollars and eventually earn the ire of the player base as it gets more updates on a yearly basis than every other mode combined. Cynical? Maybe, but we've seen this movie before.\n\nEA's servers have been something of a mess since launch, so I haven't really gotten to play much Dynasty yet - whenever I try to make a Dynasty league, it always fails to download the latest rosters from EA's servers or sign my coach's contract) - but I have messed around with the other modes, and so far, I'm pretty whelmed. I've spent the most time in Road to Glory, so let's start there.\n\nDisappointingly, there are no high school games to play in Road to Glory as there were in NCAA Football 14. Instead, you spawn your player from the ether, choose a position (you can play as a QB, HB, WR, MLB, or CB), and determine whether you want to start as a 5-star, 4-star, 3-star, or 2-star recruit. The better you are as a prospect, the sooner you'll see the field, and the better you'll play when you do, but starting off as a less desirable recruit is more challenging, and ultimately, more rewarding if you manage to make it to a starting position. (After all, everyone loves an underdog story.) I started as a 5-star QB named Joe Throw who got picked up by 5-star Michigan because I already work hard enough at my day job, thank you very much, and it's been... not great.\n\nEach week, you'll allocate Rest Points to stats like Academics, Health, Training, Leadership, Brand, and so on. You only have so many, and sometimes you'll get a text from a sponsor offering you an endorsement deal or from your academic advisor offering some extra study time, which will take up a good chunk of your weekly allotment. Spending points the right way is important because you have to maintain a certain GPA and don't want to be so tired you open yourself up to injury. So far, however, it's pretty basic resource management and the lack of any cutscenes means you're mostly just navigating menus. Think of a somehow more barebones version of Madden's already barebones Superstar mode, and you're on the right track.\n\nWhat's really frustrating, though, is the on-field Road to Glory experience. As a quarterback, you're only given one play call option each down, and you''ll have to run that play unless you spend limited Play Change points to unlock two other choices. Earn more of your coach's trust by playing well and spend your Rest Points wisely throughout the week, and you'll get more plays to choose from. Makes sense, right? The issue is that even with maximum trust, you seemingly can't audible, so if the plays you are given look like a bad fit against what the defense is showing you, there's nothing you can do besides hot route your receivers on passing plays and hope it works out. On running plays? You're out of luck, Jack.\n\nAnd even if you spent the Play Change points, you're still limited in what you can call, and sometimes it barely makes a difference anyway. If you don't want a running play and spend a Play Change point, there's no guarantee you won't get two more running plays. Spending a point and getting what are essentially two more versions of the same play feels bad because you don't earn more points as a game goes on. I get that this restriction is meant to simulate building your coach's trust, and that's all well and good, but at least let me have one or two pre-approved audibles. Give me something. Don't get me wrong: Michigan is, as of now, undefeated; Joe Throw is almighty. But I'm not having that much fun winning.\n\nCollege Ultimate Team is... Ultimate Team. The Challenges you have to do to progress are boring, and it's designed to take annoyingly long so that even decent players start to think opening their wallets isn't a bad idea. College Football 25's real sin, however, is locking all of the tutorial content inside Ultimate Team. Madden's excellent Skills Trainer, which will walk you through everything from basic gameplay to identifying and beating certain defensive coverages? Not here. Instead, it's been replaced with Ultimate Team Challenges, and the change is as bad as it sounds. One early one put me inside the red zone and tasked me with throwing a lob pass. You know, the kind you throw on deep balls after your receiver beats their corner and is running free down the field. And because it's Ultimate Team and not the Skills Trainer, you have to choose the right play from your playbook, and make the pass in a single try. Otherwise, you're staring at the \"Challenge Failed\" message over and over and over again. Remember, this is meant to be a tutorial.\n\nIt's hard not to be deeply cynical about this design choice. Surely EA Orlando could have taken the Skills Trainer, which has existed in Madden for several years, and put another version of it into College Football 25. The only reason to do it this way is to encourage new players to go into CUT - of course, they'd have to realize that the tutorials are in CUT in the first place, which is something College Football 25 doesn't advertise at all. As someone who doesn't play Ultimate Team beyond the review period for obvious reasons, I just assumed that there were no tutorials at all and EA simply wanted college football-loving folk who don't regularly play Madden to suffer. In actuality, however, they want them to get hooked on CUT and spend lots and lots of money. I'm not sure which is worse.\n\nAnd then there are things that just don't make sense. Every CPU team I've played so far loves to run a no-huddle offense, but College Football 25 does not simulate the time between plays unless you turn on the accelerated clock option in the menus. Teams otherwise come to the line instantaneously, which, aside from being annoying and making everyone on your defense very tired very quickly, means games last far longer than they should. The mini-games, which are generally more fun and varied than Madden's (though some, like WR Battle, are one-to-one recreations), have a scoring system so strict they are impossible to get gold medals on unless you play perfectly. Bafflingly, there's also no option to restart a mini-game if you finish it and don't like your score, as there is in Madden, so I've found myself picking easy ones like Option Attack and just running them over and over again to spend as little time with them as possible. If you want to restart a mini-game to try and hit a higher score after you've completed it, you have to close and reopen the entire game.\n\nAnd while College Football 25's visuals are generally wonderful, the UI is, to put it kindly, atrocious. Madden has an automated hat count, which will show you how many defenders are lined up in both sides of the box on running plays and whether or not you have an advantage in blockers on either side. It's not there in College Football, so you'd better know how to do that yourself. (I hope you like playing the CUT tutorials!) The \"previous play\" arts showing you the last play the offense and defense ran are hidden unless you flick the right stick to bring up that menu, which isn't immediately obvious. It's hard to see how much stamina defensive linemen have because, unlike the bar used in Madden, stamina in College Football 25 is represented by small blue circles over their heads that are hard to see, especially if you're zoomed out. There are no on-screen notifications telling you what type of pass you just threw, whether you landed a hit stick, whether that pick you just got was perfectly timed, or anything else.\n\nGod help you if you'd like to actually see what abilities your players have mid-match because the icons were made for ants. And while play arts look great on the field, the ones in your playbook are a step down from what recent Maddens have offered. Oh, and then there's the genuinely embarrassing things, like certain schools having outdated logos - EA has publicly admitted to Stanford, Western Michigan, and Jacksonville State already - and certain player likenesses being inaccurate. I understand that College Football 25 is a massive undertaking, and EA hasn't made a game like this in a long time, but the whole thing feels rushed, incomplete, and in a lot of ways, not up to par with Madden, much less the other sports games that Madden already wasn't up to par with, which is basically all of them.\n\nI still find myself thinking a lot about that guy I overheard at my friend's wedding, a person who is buying a $500 console just to play this game. I wonder if he, as someone who doesn't play a lot of video games, is having fun - because despite the NCAA's wider appeal, so far it feels like anyone who doesn't already know how to play EA's football games is going to have a really bad time with College Football 25. Even as someone who plays way too much Madden, the stuff that's not here is both baffling and infuriating. It's barebones, sports poor UI design, has tutorials that range from \"bad\" to \"non-existent,\" and features a number of other frustrations that simply shouldn't be here. Oh, and I really don't appreciate seeing an Ultimate Team pop-up every time I exit every other game mode. I know it's there, EA. We all do. I just don't want to play it.\n\nMaybe Dynasty will change things once the servers get sorted out and I can finally play it. Maybe that's what makes everything click. I have a lot more to see and a lot more to play. The on-field game is fun! The presentation is excellent! But everything, and I do mean everything, surrounding those things makes me want to go lie down in a dark room for a few hours and think about the choices I've made to reach this moment. Maybe, by the time I have my final thoughts ready sometime next week, everything will click. But right now, EA College Football 25 feels like a college quarterback who left school for the NFL too soon, got drafted way higher than he should have because a team was desperate, started under intense scrutiny from a fanbase and an owner who are tired of losing all the time, and then flamed out of the league because he just wasn't ready for prime time. You always wonder what might have been with a player like that. Sometimes, it's better not to rush, and instead spend an extra year honing your skills. You'd think the publisher behind Madden, of all things, would understand that.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And it only feels trite to say, because at this point, despite all the hype, the memes, the teasers, and the trailers -- none of this feels real. For the first time in 11 years, there is a college football game and it's called EA Sports College Football 25.\n\nAll 128 NCAA Division-1 FBS teams are in the game, and for an unprecedented first, this year's version of college football also features current players. It's a massive grab and statement for EA Orlando, which has been diligently working on the long-awaited successor to NCAA Football 14 since the 2021 announcement.\n\nWith the game launching across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on July 19, two of Mashable's biggest CFB fans took cracks at the game to find out if it was worth the wait. The biggest takeaway from our time playing is that CFB 25 gets the vibe of college football just right, even if the entire package could use some work. After all, it's still an EA game.\n\nCollege Football 25 gameplay\n\nSection written by Chance Townsend\n\nPlaying CFB 25 is a smooth and crisp experience. Of course, it's gonna play better than its 11-year-old predecessor, but there's a level of fluidity in here that even puts Madden to shame. This shines within the running game, which is ultra-fun, crisp, and doesn't feel too animation-heavy. Although there were times when hitting the open hole I felt like the animation was sucking me into a tackle. Running is the bread and butter of the CFB 25 experience, and honestly, it shows.\n\nThat doesn't mean the passing game didn't get some love, though. New to this version of the game is \"revamped passing,\" which shows a meter above the receiver's head during a throw. This meter determines the accuracy, power and placement of a pass. Hit the golden spot in the meter, and make the catch, but if you misjudge it, you'll end up putting your receiver in a bad spot. It's very satisfying to use compared to Madden's placement and accuracy, though it lacks the precision of that option. However, if you like Madden's interpretation of passing or love to stick to the classics, both options are available to choose from.\n\nThe passing game in general is harder than in years past. There's a frustrating amount of dropped passes by receivers at the slightest bit on contact, which makes for a troublesome gaming experience -- while probably true to life, its not fun to play with. So if you thought you could spam 4 Verts like you could in NCAA 14 for easy gains, well tough noogies buddy, get ready to learn how to RPO.\n\nSpeaking of the run-pass option, it's busted as hell. If you can't immediately make a decision when passing, you'll get an illegal man downfield penalty 90 percent of the time.\n\nOn top of that, the new two-part kick meter may also cause some yelling. Which, again, in real life, these things are difficult, but it doesn't make for a fun video game experience.\n\nDefense, however, is not fun. On higher difficulties like All-American and Heisman, stopping anything felt impossible. To be fair, the last Frostbite Engine-era football game I played was Madden 18, so maybe I just suck ass, but I don't think Troy should realistically be dropping 35 on the Longhorns.\n\nCollege Football 25 presentation and vibes\n\nSection written by Alex Perry\n\nCollege football holds a special place in my heart, probably unreasonably so. America's second-favorite version of its most popular sport is unlike any other. The games are often sloppy to the point of hilarity, intensely weird things happen all the time, and one time, a guy got so mad about a game that he poisoned historic trees on the opposing team's campus and called into a talk radio show to admit his guilt.\n\nThis colorful menagerie of nonsense, naturally, produces fantastic vibes. Every school has various ancient rituals the players or fans do before, during, and after games. Notre Dame players tap a sign that says \"PLAY LIKE A CHAMPION TODAY\" in the pregame tunnel. Nebraska fans unleash red balloons after the first scoring play of every home game. Everyone, no matter who they're rooting for, turns and waves at a children's hospital that overlooks the stadium during every Iowa home game.\n\nWithout meandering even more, I'll get straight to the point. Pretty much all of those things are present and accounted for in College Football 25. Nearly all that makes college football a compelling TV product, from boisterous marching bands and drumlines to nuclear-powered crowd noise, are represented in the game. The latter point actually affects gameplay, as receiver routes and icons will become misleading or confusing to read while an opposing crowd is bearing down on you. That's not new to football games, per se, but it's still very cool to feel the pressure of driving for a touchdown as the away team at Ohio State.\n\nSure, there are some typical jerky or unnatural-looking animations (as there have been in every 3D football game ever), but on the whole, College Football 25 nails the look of college football, too. Every in-game stadium, from Michigan's Big House to North Texas's DATCU Stadium, is stunningly rendered. Crowds look voluminous and energetic, too.\n\nThe game gets big points from me for also altering the colors and theming of the main menu depending on which school you choose as your favorite team. In particular, I love that every school's main menu screen features a ticket stub to a legendary real-life game from that program's history. Remember the time in 2011 when Iowa State upset Oklahoma State in overtime? No? Well, I do, and so did the developers of this game -- and that's what matters.\n\nThere are really only a couple of minor criticisms I have of College Football 25's presentation. First up is the commentary, which is made up of various big names in the world of college football broadcasting like Chris Fowler, Rece Davis, and Kirk Herbstreit. Those guys are all pretty much fine, if a little flat at times. The play-by-play guys like Fowler and Davis will occasionally throw in school-specific references, which is cute. I enjoyed hearing some \"Rock Chalk Jayhawk\" while playing a game at Kansas, for example.\n\nUnfortunately, the game also includes David Pollack on color commentary. I don't like David Pollack very much, for reasons that are not entirely relevant to this review. I also just find his commentary annoying and inane most of the time. Beyond that, any stadium rituals that involve licensed music are touch-and-go at best. Virginia Tech can potentially lay claim to the greatest pregame intro in all of sports, but since it uses Metallica's \"Enter Sandman,\" it's not accurately presented in this game. Bummer.\n\nStill, you'll occasionally hear \"Sandstorm\" blaring over stadium speakers between plays in any given game, so it still feels enough like college football to me.\n\nCollege Football 25 Dynasty Mode\n\nSection written by Alex Perry\n\nCollege Football 25 has two primary modes that dominate most of the attention outside of online exhibitions and microtransaction trading card nonsense. The first is Dynasty, a returning mode from the NCAA games of eld that casts the player as a made up head coach or coordinator for the school of their choosing.\n\nI have to admit, I was never the biggest Dynasty guy back in the day -- and I still may not be. But the version of the mode that's present in College Football 25 seems to have nearly everything you could want. Your coach or coordinator can have as many or as few responsibilities as you want. If you want to be meticulous about recruiting talent, you can do that. If you want to focus on gameday tactics and actually playing football (which is really more of a fun treat you get to occasionally do in this mode), you can do that, too.\n\nSpeaking of recruiting, that particular side of College Football 25's Dynasty mode is funny. It more or less works the same as it always did, as you have limited resources for player recruiting and the players' decisions are not entirely in your hands. It's been updated for modern times, though, as one of the resource-consuming activities you can do to court a player is to DM him on social media.\n\nYes, there is a button that just says \"DM player\" in the Dynasty menu. I laughed a lot when I saw that.\n\nAside from that, though, Dynasty is impressively flexible and accommodates many different styles of play for something that, from the outside, would seem to be the most hardcore mode in the game. I pretty much only like playing offense in football games, so I made an offensive coordinator and only call offensive plays now. Easy! That's what I like to see. If I'm good enough at it, maybe I'll get a mediocre head coaching job, flame out in three years, and cause an entire community in Tennessee or whatever to hate me for eternity. That's what college football is all about.\n\nCollege Football 25 Road to Glory\n\nSection written by Chance Townsend\n\nGone are the glory days of playing in high school with this year's version of CFB 25. In previous games, players could simulate high school games to garner interest from potential schools and commit to them. However, that feature got cut in favor of a more limited, streamlined Road to Glory (RTG) experience.\n\nInstead, players can pick from one of four options, starting as an elite five-star talent to a lowly two-star underdog. Your decision will determine your player overall, your choice of schools, and your place on that program's depth chart. For example, a five-star will have their top of top-level programs like UT-Austin or Michigan. But a two or three-star will have their pick of fighting for starting spots at lowly programs like Air Force or Eastern Michigan. You can walk on to any school in the game, but you'll be starting from the bench and it's hard to get rise up the depth chart.\n\nI started my RTG at Memphis, which promised my created QB the second-string position. Once the creation and recruitment process is done, you'll be taken to the main hub where you can play or sim that week's game, participate in practice drills, and spend energy points on your weekly agenda. You have the choice to put your energy into academics, leadership skills, recovery, training, or brand building. These each come with pros and cons that affect each other. For example, putting points into brand building will drop your academic bar; training causes increased injury risk; and low leadership skills create a passive loss of coach trust points until you've invested a certain amount of energy into that agenda.\n\nAdditionally, there are fun choose-your-adventure style scenarios that pop up throughout the season. You'll occasionally get messages from your academic advisor, your coaches, teammates, and even classmates that'll put you in scenarios that could increase your brand, GPA, and coach trust, or vice versa. In one instance, a classmate asked me to party the night before a game, and when I said yes, my coach caught me and I lost trust points.\n\nYou can gain a coach's trust through practice and playing games, but if you're sitting on the bench, you'll have a hard time getting points cause the drills you can play are really short and your success depends on how well the AI is at giving you plays you can work with.\n\nLimitation is pretty much the theme of playing RTG. Since you're not really in control, while playing games, you're at the mercy of the AI from everything like playcalling to the actions of your teammates on the field. Playcalling is repetitive and conservative. Going 3 and Out will cause an unskippable cutscene as you fade back into the super sim screen and the AI will only allow you to call hurry up on 4th down during the last few minutes of each half -- when the situation determines that going for it \"makes sense.\"\n\nReceivers drop open balls like they have grease on their hands and handing the ball off to the running back is like watching an AI programmer teach their LLM how to navigate a maze. So when I finally got to start at Memphis in my second season, I started 0-4 before finishing the season with a conference championship and a 7-6 record. That conference championship, by the way, did not have a special trophy presentation. Instead, I got the same victory cutscene that you get after every other game during the regular season.\n\nIf you're surprised my 7-6 Memphis Tigers even made the conference championship, that's because the sim engine is busted. This is partially due to the overall of the teams in the game being so evenly rated despite the huge gaps between teams like Akron and Alabama. Despite going 2-10 in 2023, the Akron Zips are a 73 overall team. Kennesaw State, a team that is about to have its first season in Division 1 Football (D-1 FBS), is a 73 overall team. Mid-level Power 4 schools like Texas Tech, Miami, A&M, Arkansas, Ole Miss, Utah, and Florida State are all within the 85-88 OVR range. Thus, what's been created is a level of college football parity that has never existed in real life. There are no haves and have-nots because even the fake cupcake FCS teams can beat a Power 4 school with ease.\n\nThis creates weird situations that see 6-6 Memphis play 7-6 Rice in the American Athletic Conference (AAC) championship because #4 ranked Tulane dropped its last two conference games to UTSA and Charlotte. In the first season, my alma mater, the University of North Texas, made the 12-team College Football Playoff despite only having three winning seasons since 2010. That season also saw Texas A&M win the National Championship -- a true real immersion breaker because the real-life A&M has yet to make an appearance in the SEC Championship.\n\nUnlike Dynasty, the happenings of the world around you don't have much to do with you since you don't have to deal with things like recruiting and roster management. Plus, historically, RTG has been a rather shallow experience. However, thanks to the addition of the transfer portal, you can change your team at the end of every season to create some interesting scenarios in your career.\n\nCUT and best of the rest\n\nSection written by Chance Townsend\n\nWhat's left to cover in this review is the Ultimate Team mode or CUT (College Ultimate Team). While I've never cared for Ultimate Team in any game, this version of EA's favorite money collector isn't as in your face as its other offerings like EAFC or Madden. We didn't play around much with CUT during our play testing, so our review is limited, however, it must be said that for those new to the Frostbite Engine era of EA sports games, CUT is the perfect place to start.\n\nNot because that's where EA wants you to spend money, but because the offering of solo challenges is an excellent way to get used to the different playbooks and schemes that can be used in other modes like Dynasty. It's the perfect training ground to get a feel of what kind of style you'd want to play for whenever you decide to take the reigns at a bottom-barrel MAC program. Each playbook offers different challenges, like the Air Raid that asks you to use a hurry-up offense and pass for five straight plays.\n\nIs College Football 25 Worth It?\n\nTo keep things brief, if you love college football, this game you're waiting for. As a pure gameplay experience, CFB 25 is both challenging and rewarding in ways that Madden and 2K aren't. However, it's not the game we've waited 11 years for. Dynasty lacks a lot of depth and quality-of-life changes that were present in NCAA 14, alongside a mind-numbingly inane UI and drumline menu songs.\n\nEA Orlando promised fans that this is the college football game they deserve, and considering it has all the trappings of an EA sports game, they weren't lying. But if you can look past that and just focus on what's in the game, you'll have a fun time.", "source": {"uri": "sea.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable SEA"}, "authors": [],

But the game was NCAA Football 14, and the rosters were long outdated.\n\nSo like millions of other college football junkies, Vallow went online and downloaded an updated roster file compiled by an anonymous fan on a Discord server. That file contained the aforementioned Simmons discrepancy. Random ratings like that are killing Vallow. He had to do something about it.\n\nThat one jumped out at me, and I thought, what if I could figure out a way to do this other than manually on an Xbox, Vallow said. And then fast forward to college, freshman year my first class was an introduction to Excel, and I thought, oh my God, this is the way. This is how I would do it.\n\nVallow took his rudimentary Excel skills and built player generation models to formulate player ratings. He said Simmons' speed was just one of many minor issues he had with fan-generated roster files. It spurred Vallow on a hobby that turned into an obsession that ended with a job.\n\nNow 24, he's parlayed his passion for creating updated NCAA 14 roster files into a part-time job at EA Sports, where he applies his custom-built ranking algorithms as part of the team that builds the roster for College Football 25, the first college football video game released in 11 years.\n\nWhen NCAA Football went down, I thought we were never going to get the game back. I thought that was it, said Kofi Yeboah, a content creator at Secret base who makes gaming videos. It was like, keep your Xbox 360, keep your PS3, because that's the only way you can play.\n\nVallow made it his unpaid job to keep NCAA 14 as current as possible, and he was determined to be methodical with his evaluations. He didn't want to base complex receiver evaluations on two-dimensional stats like receptions and yards. He didn't want to gloss over the complexities of offensive and defensive lineman skills. What he wanted was tangible data.\n\nThen came Pro Football Focus. Around 2020, PFF, a sports analytics company that uses a rating system to evaluate every player on every play in a football game, began sharing its college football data publicly with its subscribers.\n\nVallow, then a sophomore majoring in finance and business analytics with hopes of becoming an investment banker, dove into the data. Now he had real numbers to back up his video game ratings. Some extra time from living at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic helped, too.\n\nThe main thing I always wanted was that I wanted to have some kind of data backup for every metric, he said. So if someone said, Hey, why is so-and-so using this route compared to that? Well, everything always went back to data.\n\nVallow later realized that high school athletic statistics and off-season training could provide him with even more information for assessing physical attributes.\n\nWhen he started sharing his updated rosters publicly, people were shocked by the details of players' physical attributes, even as some opponents felt their schools and favorite players were being underrated. Vallow had learned to trust his data.\n\nThere were some guys from MAC schools who were like, Hey, so and so (isn't rated well) and I'm just going to say sorry and do it in the next update, he said, laughing. Kansas was one where I just got beat up, and I was like, I'm going to try this with thousands of players!\n\nAfter further refining his formulas and learning how to better interpret his data, Vallow proved that his rating system was scalable to thousands of players.\n\nWhen EA Sports announced that a college football game would actually be coming back, he reached out to an employee on LinkedIn and offered to share all the work he had done. He was soon hired as an independent contractor to work with their roster team.\n\nI called them and said, 'Hey, I can now put together Alabama's entire recruiting class right now based on the data that I have, by inputting it and calculating it.' And I think they were like, 'Oh, this is really valuable.'\n\nOperation Sports sees thousands of users flock to hundreds of video game forum threads every day. The site's college football community is one of its most visited destinations, and it's a place where real relationships have been formed over the years.\n\nAs for the community itself, it's positive. There are a lot of people who are friends and then they join Discords together, so there's still a lot of that stuff going on, said Chase Becotte, senior editor of Operation Sports, comparing his site's user base to other forums.\n\nWith Reddit, it's a more negative dogpile, and that goes for both users and topics. We can still be negative on topics, but this community is great. I think it's a good balance overall.\n\nWhile it's not uncommon for a video game to have a loyal fanbase, it's much more common for communities to hate the games themselves.\n\nBut in the decade-plus that the college football community went without a new game, something different happened to the people who kept NCAA 14 alive. That community thrived on both the nostalgia of NCAA 14 feeling like the series' final game and the fact that it was a genuinely well-made title, Becotte said.\n\nIt's pretty awesome, Vallow said. From the outside, if someone said to me, Me and all my friends are talking online about this 10-year-old video game, I'd be like, You guys are kind of losers. But then I'm like, Wait a minute, that's me.\n\nRoster updaters like Vallow had hundreds of fans leave feedback on reviews. Streamers like Yeboah had thousands of YouTube viewers watching him rebuild East Carolina in Dynasty mode.\n\nHere it's your sandbox and you share your sandcastle creations with your friends, and that's cool, Yeboah said.\n\nNow that the golden age of College Football 25 has arrived, complete with real player names, thanks to NIL, what happens to those sandcastles?\n\nBecotte called it bittersweet. Yeboah said he'll have a hard time letting NCAA 14 go for good.\n\nYou're going to make me cry, Mark, Vallow said. I don't know what I'm going to be like.\n\nIn video games, an 11-year gap is like a 110-year technological leap in another industry. But for the gaming generation of yesteryear, Becotte and Vallow are confident that EA Sports has spent the last decade listening to its fans and giving its community the features they've been asking for.\n\nAnd if College Football 25 can't match the legacy of NCAA 14? Well, the old game isn't far behind.\n\nThe community has kept the game alive for as long as it needed to be, Yeboah said, and even when College Football 25 comes out, I think there will still be a lot of people playing NCAA 14 because the game is that good.\n\nVallow was 13 years old when NCAA 14 came out. His younger brother was around 13 when Vallow was home during COVID-19 and making his roster updates. Now their youngest brother is 13 years old with College Football 25 coming out.\n\nHe says he has no idea whether his younger brothers will appreciate the new game as much as he has over the past decade, but Vallow is hopeful that the spirit of NCAA 14 will live on, as fans have had the chance to influence the next generation of college football games.\n\nWhen he first joined EA Sports, he was shocked to discover that fans like himself were putting together College Football 25.\n\nObviously I'm going to miss that game, but because you play it so much, there's a little bit of you that thinks, maybe if this, this, this, and this were different, and that's the great thing that EA did. They listened and it looks like it was too good to be true, Vallow said.\n\nI thought, You guys really listened to the things that people wanted? And they said, Yeah, we goods these people.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Excel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Simmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaw_Yeboah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yaw Yeboah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hobby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox 360"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_FBS_independent_schools", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I FBS independent schools"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/17180002/NCAA_2014-2025.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

In EA Sports College Football 25, players can carve their own destiny as a rising star on the competitive collegiate football stage.\n\nThose who are partaking in their own player journey in Road To Glory mode will need to balance studies, training, sponsorship opportunities, and a social life, as they try to elevate their team and realize their national championship dreams. A big part of achieving this requires knowledge of how to get Skill Points in College Football 25, as their player will need to continue to improve in order to beat the best teams in college football.\n\nRelated\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 Burning Questions\n\nThe following guide will aim to answer all of the most frequently asked questions about EA Sports College Football 25.\n\nWhat Are Skill Points in Road To Glory?\n\nPlayer ratings are a staple in any major sports game, from UFC and NBA to NFL and NHL, and will be the same case in Madden 25, and is no different in EA Sports College Football, as every player is given a rating that reflects their skills. In Road To Glory mode, you will pick your starting rating and work towards improving it, alongside building your coach's trust, which is where Skill Points come into play.\n\nSkill Points are somewhat of a currency that players can earn and spend to upgrade their athlete in different facets of their game. These facets will depend on the position you are playing, but will include attributes such as elusiveness, strength, and accuracy. The higher the skill level, the more Skill Points you will need to spend to upgrade.\n\nHow To Get Skill Points in Road To Glory\n\nAs the name might suggest, Skill Points are best acquired by showcasing your skills in the position you play in, whether that be Quarterback, Running Back, Tight End, or Wide Receiver. There are two primary ways that Skill Points can be acquired:\n\nBy spending Energy on Training each week. This can be done in the Weekly Agenda section of the Road To Glory hub. It's worth noting, however, that any points you spend on training can't be used for other areas that are not as easily accessible in-game, such as Endorsements or Leadership. By completing milestones during games. These milestones include reaching another first down, performing successful throws or catches, and scoring touchdowns. Each positive feat you achieve in a game will contribute to your total XP, which you will need to earn to get Skill Points.\n\nNaturally, the journey that you choose in Road To Glory mode will determine how accessible these opportunities are. You will find that progression as an Underdog is far slower, as you are reliant on the Weekly Agenda Training more, since you are given little to no opportunities to showcase your skills on the field.

Save the $30, learn the game or have fun and switch it off when it's too frustrating.\n\nFirst out of the gate is an earlier release date giving you an extra three days to learn the game and gain an advantage over your friends. The Deluxe Edition releases on July 16 whilst those on the Standard Edition will need to wait until July 19.\n\nFor the price of $99.99, Deluxe Edition buyers will gain an extra three days of playing time as well as 4600 College Football Points, an Alma Mater Ultimate Team Pack a Cover Athlete Ultimate Team Pack and Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item.\n\nAdditionally, on the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, the College Football 25 Deluxe Edition offers a Heisman Hopeful Ultimate Team Pack (Choice of one player item).", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walsh_College_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Walsh College Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Esports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Evening_Standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Evening Standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Games_Store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Games Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_mater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alma mater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/6042c690b7258441e1ad645aed963c9e/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/07/19/17213972225294.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 2121, "textEnd": 2128}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 2190, "textEnd": 2197}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Over a decade of yearning met its catharsis with the game's release this week -- which leaves the only burning question: Is it all worth it? Is EA Sports' return to college football the game fans deserve, or have fears of a phoned-in, re-skinned version of Madden been realized?\n\nIt's unfair to keep that answer a secret any longer, so let's go ahead and say it. Not only is College Football 25 the love letter to the sport that fans have been waiting for, but it's also one of the greatest football games ever released. That statement comes with a weight of experiencing dating back to Madden 95, through NFL 2K5, and even the oft-forgotten NFL Quarterback Club series. Yes, this is the game you wanted -- and yes, it's spectacular.\n\nThere are myriad differences between College Football 25 and Madden, but on its most superficial level everything just feels different, more special, and more considered. It's clear that the development team behind the game is deeply aware of the importance of atmosphere and individuality, and every single team is just dripping in it.\n\nNo two games feel the same when playing the home team. Each school's pre-game traditions, fight songs, and in-stadium atmosphere have been recreated to such a level that there are times it doesn't even feel like the same game. There's a chasm of difference between playing at home as a struggling, low-prestige team that has difficulty filling the stands -- and fever-pitch Saturday night rivalry game in Ann Arbor.\n\nIn addition to obvious differences like fan density and volume, there are dozens of small pieces of nuance you notice over time. Fans in the stands of a Georgia game, for instance, are more likely to have painted faces, hold signs, even paint multi-fan messages on their stomachs -- while a more buttoned-up football school like North Carolina has a tendency to have fans that skew older, predominantly wearing polos and khakis.\n\nThis extends to music on stadiums PAs as well. The location of the school, paired with the area's demographics play a role in what you'll hear on game day. LSU pipes a lot of hip hop into its stadium. West Virginia plays predominantly classic rock. If you hear it on game day there's a good chance you'll hear it in College Football 25.\n\nIt's tough to quantify exactly what all these differences do to improve the experience, but in totality it all just feels special. Even with schools I don't personally know much about, the presentation heightens the experience. During my dynasty I was playing at Old Dominion, only to be met with a shot of the school's color guard in full military uniform. Sure enough it's a tradition at football games, and if something like that has been created for Old Dominion, you can extrapolate what has been done for larger, more popular schools.\n\nNobody is left behind in College Football 25. If you're a school that has been included you're going to get a completely individualized atmosphere and feel. No generic stadiums. No half-assed creations. Everything is bespoke, and beautiful.\n\nAre there similarities to the on-field actions of Madden? Yes, but don't for a second think this is a one-for-one copy. While there is shared DNA between some animations, plays, and schemes, that's about as far as the comparisons go.\n\nPlaying College Football 25 at its heart is a faster-paced, higher scoring football game than most people are accustomed to. Big plays happen with regularity, especially when there's a distinct talent mismatch between teams. Part of what makes this system work so well is the imperfection, something I lauded about the leaps Madden 25 made last year.\n\nMissed blocks, failed assignments, blown coverage and botched tackles are far more prevalent in college ball than its pro cousin, and that all makes for unique experiences. There are no go-to plays that always work. Conversely there are plays that NEVER work in Madden, but are actually effective in College Football 25. When was the last time you saw a draw play go for 10+ yards, or a counter run actually work? Both do in this game, and it completely revolutionizes how running the ball feels.\n\nIf you're a person who loves the ground game, then this game is a godsend. Carrying the rock is essential to a good offense in College Football 25, and with all the imperfections in play there's a need to get solid, reliable yards through the running game. Blocking has been vastly overhauled where across dozens of games I've yet to see a missed block or assignment that makes zero sense, with wide receivers and tight ends doing their part to seal the edges or get out ahead and block downfield -- rather than just stop and watch the play as we've become accustomed to.\n\nThis has a knock on effect where play action passing works better, trick plays are more impactful, and if you've established the run you will see it affect the rest of your play calling. Just like we see in the real game.\n\nPassing has never been more exciting, or nerve-wracking. A critical 3rd-and-7 is no longer met with a rote, memorized play that can always pick up 10. If your No. 1 receiver isn't a bonafide star player they can, and will run their route incorrectly, make a slow cut, or get jammed to the point their out of the play. It doesn't happen with enough regularity to become a frustration, it's just a known element of the game you need to scheme and work around to achieve success.\n\nThere's never a shortage of things to do in College Football 25. In fact, turning it on is a constant case of decision paralysis. Do I want to experience a big rivalry game of a team I haven't played? Keep working on my Dynasty, where the be recruiting decision is coming down to the wire for that dual-threat QB I've invested so much time in? What about my power running back in Road to Glory? Doesn't anyone care about my anthropomorphized version of Bluey's dad from the hit Disney kids show Bluey?\n\nBandit Heeler is currently RB2 for Washington. Just thought I'd let you know.\n\nWhat makes the experience of College Football 25 so great is the constant shifts in experience you're able to have. This isn't a case of simply jumping between variations of the same thing, but very unique experiences that have as much to do with what you do off the field, than on it.\n\nDynasty is a fully-realized college football seasonal experience. Recruiting is the heart of the non-football activity, and once you understand its systems it's incredibly engaging. Every recruit has a chart of things that are important to them ranging from playing time, to personal brand, and distance to their home -- all of which play a role in how you recruit. A 1.5 star prestige school can't offer brand, so you'll need to focus on other areas to recruit, and from there it's almost a turn-based RPG of selecting the right moves at the right time to enter a recruit's Top 8, then Top 5, and hopefully get a commitment.\n\nThese moves are all budgeted with hours, and using them wisely is a really fun puzzle to put together. You can up the pressure by having a recruit visit on the weekend of a tough game, knowing that a win or loss on the field won't just effect standings, but your ability to land your target.\n\nThat same sort of budgeting and RPG experience is present in Road to Glory, which serves as the \"be a pro\" mode for the game. Here you'll need to balance being a college athlete with keeping your grades up, socializing, building your brand, and training for the field -- and it's remarkably difficult to hit all those notes while earning coach trust and playing time as a result.\n\nThe differences between Dynasty and Road to Glory as so significant that they feel like different games, and that's a great thing that keeps the came constantly fresh. The second you get frustrated with one, jump on over and work on something else. It creates a brilliant package that's impossible to put down.\n\nCollege Football 25 is so far beyond a debut product it's astonishing. If this is the launching off point for more then the future is in good hands. The game delivers on giving the sights, sounds, and feel of the sport in a way that's addictive beyond all measure.\n\nMore than anything else, College Football 25 delivers on bringing fun back to football. It's the biggest leap we've seen in football gaming in years -- maybe even ever, and that makes it a must-own for anyone with even a passing interest in college football.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me I need to try and have Bandit Heeler become the featured back on Washington's playoff team.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri":

How do they feel now?", "body": "Erik Vallow just couldn't handle Isaiah Simmons' speed rating being a 79.\n\nThe 19-year-old Vallow was in his freshman year at Indiana in 2019, trying to keep the spark of his favorite video game alive. But the game was NCAA Football 14, and the rosters were long outdated.\n\nSo like millions of other college football junkies, Vallow went online and downloaded an updated roster file, put together by an anonymous fan on a Discord server. That file contained the aforementioned Simmons discrepancy. Haphazard ratings like that ground Vallow's gears. He had to do something about it.\n\n\"That one stuck out to me, and I was like, 'If only I knew any way to do this other than manually on an Xbox,'\" Vallow said. \"And then flash forward to college, in freshman year my first class was an intro to Excel class, and I was like, 'Oh my God, this is the way. This is how I would do it.'\"\n\nVallow went to work with his rudimentary Excel skills and built out player generation models to determine player ratings formulaically. He said Simmons' speed was just one of many small things he took issue with in fan-made roster files. It spurred Vallow into a hobby that became an obsession and ended with a job.\n\nNow 24, he parlayed a passion project of creating updated NCAA 14 roster files into a part-time job with EA Sports, where he applies his custom-made rating algorithms as a member of the roster creation team for College Football 25 -- the first college football video game released in 11 years.\n\n\"When NCAA Football stopped, I thought we were never getting the game back. I thought that was it,\" said Kofi Yeboah, a content creator with Secret Base who makes gaming videos. \"It was like keep your Xbox 360, keep your PS3, because that's the only way you'll be able to play.\"\n\nVallow made it his unpaid job to keep NCAA 14 as updated as possible, and he was determined to be methodical with his ratings. He didn't want to base complex receiver ratings off two-dimensional statistics like receptions and yards. He didn't want to gloss over the intricacies of offensive and defensive lineman skill sets. What he wanted was tangible data.\n\nThen came Pro Football Focus. Around 2020, PFF -- a sports analytics company that uses a grading system to evaluate every player on every play during a football game -- started sharing its college football data publicly with its subscribers.\n\nVallow, who was then in his sophomore year and majoring in finance and business analytics with hopes of becoming an investment banker, dived into the data. Now he had real-life numbers to back up his video-game ratings. Some extra time from living back at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic helped too.\n\n\"My biggest thing I always wanted was for every stat, I wanted some sort of data backup for it,\" he said. \"So if someone asked, 'Hey, why is so-and-so's route running this number compared to that?' Well, everything was always going back to data.\"\n\nVallow later realized track and field statistics from a player's high school and offseason training can give him even more information for rating physical traits.\n\nWhen he started sharing his updated rosters publicly, people were shocked by the detail of the players' physical attributes, even if there were naysayers who felt their school and favorite players were underrated. Vallow had learned to lean on his data.\n\n\"There'd be some guys from some MAC schools saying, 'Hey, so and so (isn't rated right)' and I'd just say sorry and get to it in the next update,\" he said with a laugh. \"Kansas was one where I just got ripped, and I was like 'I'm trying -- this is thousands of players!'\"\n\nAfter continuing to fine-tune his formulas while learning how to better interpret his data, Vallow proved his rating system was successfully scalable for thousands of players.\n\nWhen EA Sports announced that a college football game was truly coming back, he reached out to an employee on LinkedIn and offered to share all the work he put together. He was soon hired as an independent contractor to work with their roster team.\n\n\"I got on a call and showed them, 'Hey I could generate Alabama's whole recruiting class right now just based on the data I have, just input and calculate,'\" he said, \"and I think they were like, 'Oh, this is actually valuable.'\"\n\nAt Operation Sports, thousands of users flock to hundreds of video game forum threads on a daily basis. The site's college football community is among its most frequented destinations, and it's a place where genuine relationships have formed over the years.\n\n\"In terms of the community itself, that's a positive. There's a lot of people who are friends and then they join Discords together as well, so there's a lot of that stuff that's still happening,\" said Chase Becotte, senior editor of Operation Sports, comparing the users on his site to other forums.\n\n\"With Reddit, it is a more negative dogpile, and that's on users as well as topics. We can still get negative about topics, but this community rules. I think it's a good balance overall.\"\n\nWhile it's not rare for a video game to have a devoted fan base, it's far more common for communities to be devoted to hating the games themselves.\n\nBut in the decade-plus of the college football community going without a new game, something different happened with the people who kept NCAA 14 alive. That community thrived on both the nostalgia of NCAA 14 seeming like the last game of the series and also that it was a really well-made title, Becotte said.\n\n\"It's pretty awesome,\" Vallow said. \"From the outside, if someone was telling me, 'Me and all my friends talk online about this 10-year-old video game,' I'd be like, 'You guys are kind of losers.' But then I'm like, 'Wait a second, that's me.'\"\n\nRoster updaters like Vallow had hundreds of fans giving feedback on ratings. Streamers like Yeboah have thousands of YouTube viewers watching him rebuild East Carolina in Dynasty mode.\n\n\"Here, it's your sandbox and you're sharing sandcastle creations with your friends, and it's dope,\" Yeboah said.\n\nSo what happens to those sandcastles now that the high tide of College Football 25 is rolling in -- complete with real players' names, thanks to NIL?\n\nBecotte called it bittersweet. Yeboah said he'll have a hard time putting NCAA 14 away for good.\n\n\"You're gonna make me cry, Mark,\" Vallow said. \"I don't know what I'm gonna be like.\"\n\nIn video games, an 11-year gap is like a 110-year technological leap in another industry. But for the gaming generation of yesteryear, Becotte and Vallow are confident that EA Sports has listened to its fan base over the past decade and are giving its community the features they've clamored for.\n\nAnd if College Football 25 doesn't live up to the legacy of NCAA 14? The old game won't be far away.\n\n\"The community kept the game alive for as long as it needed to be,\" Yeboah said, \"and even when College Football 25 comes out, I feel like there's still going to be a bunch of people that play NCAA 14 because that's just how good the game is.\"\n\nVallow was 13 years old when NCAA 14 was released. His younger brother was around 13 years old when Vallow was back home during COVID-19 making his roster updates. Now their youngest brother is 13 years old with College Football 25 coming out.\n\nHe said he has no idea if his younger brothers will appreciate the new game like he has for the past decade, but Vallow cherishes that the spirit of NCAA 14 will live on because fans have gotten to influence the next generation of college football games.\n\nWhen he first started working with EA Sports, he was shocked to find fans like himself were the ones putting College Football 25 together.\n\n\"Obviously I'm going to miss that game, but also like you play it so much, there's a little bit of you that thinks, 'Maybe if this, this, this and this were different,' and that's the awesome thing that EA did. They listened and it seems like it was too good to be true,\" Vallow said.\n\n\"I was like, 'You guys were actually listening to the things people wanted?' And they were like, 'Yeah, we were those people.'\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_puleo@nytimes.com", "name": "Mark Puleo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Excel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Simmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaw_Yeboah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yaw Yeboah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hobby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SB Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox 360"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grading in education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/17180002/NCAA_2014-2025.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

It seemed unlikely when users discovered the player, since he's only a 12 overall, but it's now confirmed.\n\nIt's likely that Moore is a random-generated character that EA Sports used to fill a roster spot. This is very common in sports video games, as some players and coaches opt out of the licensing agreement.\n\nMORE: Who is the top rated player in EA Sports College Football 25?\n\nIt's most common with historic teams featured in video games, since leagues typically have an agreement for all players to be included in games. For example, Charles Barkley isn't included in NBA 2K, so the game replaces him with a computer-generated player.\n\nBill Belichick also infamously is left out of the Madden series and is replaced with a generic head coach.\n\nThe generic players are typically lower overall and not in the main rotation or lineup for teams. Still, a 12 overall is absurdly low.\n\nEast Carolina has three quarterbacks on its 2024 roster, and Moore isn't one of them.

But when new versions were discontinued in 2013 due to a nasty stalemate in legal battles, fans were devastated.\n\nNow, more than ten years later, true fans are happy about its return.\n\n\"When the clock struck midnight on the new year, all I could think was it was finally coming back,\" 25-year-old diehard fan Richard Clemens of Norwalk, Connecticut, told The Post.\n\nHe added that besides being engaged, reprising the college gridiron franchise, a franchise that ran for 21 years before being shut down, is \"the highlight of my year.\"\n\nThe beloved game went belly up 11 years ago when the NCAA has terminated its brand licensing contract and also EA Sports and Collegiate Licensing Company facing paying a $40 million settlement for improper use of the names and likenesses of student-athletes.\n\nA friend of Clemens, Eric Kosh, 26, called it \"hugely disappointing\" that he himself could no longer play an American football video game as a student.\n\n\"It was horrible. We would have tournaments in our dorm all the time,\" Kosh told The Post, adding that he's kept his now-obsolete PlayStation 3 console to continue scoring with the old games ever since.\n\nBut in 2021, the NCAA changed its name, image and likeness (NIL) rights rules, allowing student-athletes to profit from the use of their brand, finally paving the way for new games.\n\n\"The reaction from the fans was like everyone in America won the lottery at the same time,\" Clemens said.\n\nThe manufacturer certainly scored a touchdown: the game's $70 pre-sale with three days of early access for $90 grossed a whopping $70 million during its first recent sneak-peek day, reported Barstool Sports.\n\nThe college-level game, with 134 universities to choose from, always competed with its professional football brethren, the hugely popular series \"John Madden Football\" and \"Madden NFL,\" which offered only 32 average teams.\n\n\"You absolutely can't compare the two. 'College Football' blows 'Madden' out of the water,\" 24-year-old avid player Anthony Pantino of Bethpage, New York, told The Post.\n\nLike Kosh, he fired up his old-school Xbox 360 to play old versions of his favorite games.\n\nThe game even allows players to coach and \"build a college football dynasty from the ground up,\" an intricate aspect that appealed to Pantino since he first fell in love with the game in 2007.\n\n\"The goal is to be better than Nick Saban,\" he said proudly of the legendary Alabama coach who retired earlier this year.\n\nPantino admitted he could spend an entire weekend putting together his virtual football schedule for the long-awaited return of the cutting-edge game.\n\n\"Madden doesn't give you that kind of depth,\" he said, adding that \"College Football\" gives a player \"a real sense of accomplishment.\"\n\nFor other diehards like Kosh, this game is no child's play either. He spent weeks compiling a multi-page document on tactics and tweaks that make the game even more realistically challenging.\n\n\"This is the real deal. We've been waiting over 10 years to get back to it, and I'm not wasting any time,\" he said.\n\n\"We're all glued to our TVs on Friday.

And it only feels trite to say, because at this point, despite all the hype, the memes, the teasers, and the trailers -- none of this feels real. For the first time in 11 years, there is a college football game and it's called EA Sports College Football 25.\n\nAll 128 NCAA Division-1 FBS teams are in the game, and for an unprecedented first, this year's version of college football also features current players. It's a massive grab and statement for EA Orlando, which has been diligently working on the long-awaited successor to NCAA Football 14 since the 2021 announcement.\n\nWith the game launching across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on July 19, two of Mashable's biggest CFB fans took cracks at the game to find out if it was worth the wait. The biggest takeaway from our time playing is that CFB 25 gets the vibe of college football just right, even if the entire package could use some work. After all, it's still an EA game.\n\nSection written by Chance Townsend\n\nPlaying CFB 25 is a smooth and crisp experience. Of course, it's gonna play better than its 11-year-old predecessor, but there's a level of fluidity in here that even puts Madden to shame. This shines within the running game, which is ultra-fun, crisp, and doesn't feel too animation-heavy. Although there were times when hitting the open hole I felt like the animation was sucking me into a tackle. Running is the bread and butter of the CFB 25 experience, and honestly, it shows.\n\nThat doesn't mean the passing game didn't get some love, though. New to this version of the game is \"revamped passing,\" which shows a meter above the receiver's head during a throw. This meter determines the accuracy, power and placement of a pass. Hit the golden spot in the meter, and make the catch, but if you misjudge it, you'll end up putting your receiver in a bad spot. It's very satisfying to use compared to Madden's placement and accuracy, though it lacks the precision of that option. However, if you like Madden's interpretation of passing or love to stick to the classics, both options are available to choose from.\n\nThe passing game in general is harder than in years past. There's a frustrating amount of dropped passes by receivers at the slightest bit on contact, which makes for a troublesome gaming experience -- while probably true to life, its not fun to play with. So if you thought you could spam 4 Verts like you could in NCAA 14 for easy gains, well tough noogies buddy, get ready to learn how to RPO.\n\nSpeaking of the run-pass option, it's busted as hell. If you can't immediately make a decision when passing, you'll get an illegal man downfield penalty 90 percent of the time.\n\nOn top of that, the new two-part kick meter may also cause some yelling. Which, again, in real life, these things are difficult, but it doesn't make for a fun video game experience.\n\nDefense, however, is not fun. On higher difficulties like All-American and Heisman, stopping anything felt impossible. To be fair, the last Frostbite Engine-era football game I played was Madden 18, so maybe I just suck ass, but I don't think Troy should realistically be dropping 35 on the Longhorns.\n\nSection written by Alex Perry\n\nCollege football holds a special place in my heart, probably unreasonably so. America's second-favorite version of its most popular sport is unlike any other. The games are often sloppy to the point of hilarity, intensely weird things happen all the time, and one time, a guy got so mad about a game that he poisoned historic trees on the opposing team's campus and called into a talk radio show to admit his guilt.\n\nThis colorful menagerie of nonsense, naturally, produces fantastic vibes. Every school has various ancient rituals the players or fans do before, during, and after games. Notre Dame players tap a sign that says \"PLAY LIKE A CHAMPION TODAY\" in the pregame tunnel. Nebraska fans unleash red balloons after the first scoring play of every home game. Everyone, no matter who they're rooting for, turns and waves at a children's hospital that overlooks the stadium during every Iowa home game.\n\nWithout meandering even more, I'll get straight to the point. Pretty much all of those things are present and accounted for in College Football 25. Nearly all that makes college football a compelling TV product, from boisterous marching bands and drumlines to nuclear-powered crowd noise, are represented in the game. The latter point actually affects gameplay, as receiver routes and icons will become misleading or confusing to read while an opposing crowd is bearing down on you. That's not new to football games, per se, but it's still very cool to feel the pressure of driving for a touchdown as the away team at Ohio State.\n\nSure, there are some typical jerky or unnatural-looking animations (as there have been in every 3D football game ever), but on the whole, College Football 25 nails the look of college football, too. Every in-game stadium, from Michigan's Big House to North Texas's DATCU Stadium, is stunningly rendered. Crowds look voluminous and energetic, too.\n\nThe game gets big points from me for also altering the colors and theming of the main menu depending on which school you choose as your favorite team. In particular, I love that every school's main menu screen features a ticket stub to a legendary real-life game from that program's history. Remember the time in 2011 when Iowa State upset Oklahoma State in overtime? No? Well, I do, and so did the developers of this game -- and that's what matters.\n\nThere are really only a couple of minor criticisms I have of College Football 25's presentation. First up is the commentary, which is made up of various big names in the world of college football broadcasting like Chris Fowler, Rece Davis, and Kirk Herbstreit. Those guys are all pretty much fine, if a little flat at times. The play-by-play guys like Fowler and Davis will occasionally throw in school-specific references, which is cute. I enjoyed hearing some \"Rock Chalk Jayhawk\" while playing a game at Kansas, for example.\n\nUnfortunately, the game also includes David Pollack on color commentary. I don't like David Pollack very much, for reasons that are not entirely relevant to this review. I also just find his commentary annoying and inane most of the time. Beyond that, any stadium rituals that involve licensed music are touch-and-go at best. Virginia Tech can potentially lay claim to the greatest pregame intro in all of sports, but since it uses Metallica's \"Enter Sandman,\" it's not accurately presented in this game. Bummer.\n\nStill, you'll occasionally hear \"Sandstorm\" blaring over stadium speakers between plays in any given game, so it still feels enough like college football to me.\n\nSection written by Alex Perry\n\nCollege Football 25 has two primary modes that dominate most of the attention outside of online exhibitions and microtransaction trading card nonsense. The first is Dynasty, a returning mode from the NCAA games of eld that casts the player as a made up head coach or coordinator for the school of their choosing.\n\nI have to admit, I was never the biggest Dynasty guy back in the day -- and I still may not be. But the version of the mode that's present in College Football 25 seems to have nearly everything you could want. Your coach or coordinator can have as many or as few responsibilities as you want. If you want to be meticulous about recruiting talent, you can do that. If you want to focus on gameday tactics and actually playing football (which is really more of a fun treat you get to occasionally do in this mode), you can do that, too.\n\nSpeaking of recruiting, that particular side of College Football 25's Dynasty mode is funny. It more or less works the same as it always did, as you have limited resources for player recruiting and the players' decisions are not entirely in your hands. It's been updated for modern times, though, as one of the resource-consuming activities you can do to court a player is to DM him on social media.\n\nYes, there is a button that just says \"DM player\" in the Dynasty menu. I laughed a lot when I saw that.\n\nAside from that, though, Dynasty is impressively flexible and accommodates many different styles of play for something that, from the outside, would seem to be the most hardcore mode in the game. I pretty much only like playing offense in football games, so I made an offensive coordinator and only call offensive plays now. Easy! That's what I like to see. If I'm good enough at it, maybe I'll get a mediocre head coaching job, flame out in three years, and cause an entire community in Tennessee or whatever to hate me for eternity. That's what college football is all about.\n\nSection written by Chance Townsend\n\nGone are the glory days of playing in high school with this year's version of CFB 25. In previous games, players could simulate high school games to garner interest from potential schools and commit to them. However, that feature got cut in favor of a more limited, streamlined Road to Glory (RTG) experience.\n\nInstead, players can pick from one of four options, starting as an elite five-star talent to a lowly two-star underdog. Your decision will determine your player overall, your choice of schools, and your place on that program's depth chart. For example, a five-star will have their top of top-level programs like UT-Austin or Michigan. But a two or three-star will have their pick of fighting for starting spots at lowly programs like Air Force or Eastern Michigan. You can walk on to any school in the game, but you'll be starting from the bench and it's hard to get rise up the depth chart.\n\nI started my RTG at Memphis, which promised my created QB the second-string position. Once the creation and recruitment process is done, you'll be taken to the main hub where you can play or sim that week's game, participate in practice drills, and spend energy points on your weekly agenda. You have the choice to put your energy into academics, leadership skills, recovery, training, or brand building. These each come with pros and cons that affect each other. For example, putting points into brand building will drop your academic bar; training causes increased injury risk; and low leadership skills create a passive loss of coach trust points until you've invested a certain amount of energy into that agenda.\n\nAdditionally, there are fun choose-your-adventure style scenarios that pop up throughout the season. You'll occasionally get messages from your academic advisor, your coaches, teammates, and even classmates that'll put you in scenarios that could increase your brand, GPA, and coach trust, or vice versa. In one instance, a classmate asked me to party the night before a game, and when I said yes, my coach caught me and I lost trust points.\n\nYou can gain a coach's trust through practice and playing games, but if you're sitting on the bench, you'll have a hard time getting points cause the drills you can play are really short and your success depends on how well the AI is at giving you plays you can work with.\n\nLimitation is pretty much the theme of playing RTG. Since you're not really in control, while playing games, you're at the mercy of the AI from everything like playcalling to the actions of your teammates on the field. Playcalling is repetitive and conservative. Going 3 and Out will cause an unskippable cutscene as you fade back into the super sim screen and the AI will only allow you to call hurry up on 4th down during the last few minutes of each half -- when the situation determines that going for it \"makes sense.\"\n\nReceivers drop open balls like they have grease on their hands and handing the ball off to the running back is like watching an AI programmer teach their LLM how to navigate a maze. So when I finally got to start at Memphis in my second season, I started 0-4 before finishing the season with a conference championship and a 7-6 record. That conference championship, by the way, did not have a special trophy presentation. Instead, I got the same victory cutscene that you get after every other game during the regular season.\n\nIf you're surprised my 7-6 Memphis Tigers even made the conference championship, that's because the sim engine is busted. This is partially due to the overall of the teams in the game being so evenly rated despite the huge gaps between teams like Akron and Alabama. Despite going 2-10 in 2023, the Akron Zips are a 73 overall team. Kennesaw State, a team that is about to have its first season in Division 1 Football (D-1 FBS), is a 73 overall team. Mid-level Power 4 schools like Texas Tech, Miami, A&M, Arkansas, Ole Miss, Utah, and Florida State are all within the 85-88 OVR range. Thus, what's been created is a level of college football parity that has never existed in real life. There are no haves and have-nots because even the fake cupcake FCS teams can beat a Power 4 school with ease.\n\nThis creates weird situations that see 6-6 Memphis play 7-6 Rice in the American Athletic Conference (AAC) championship because #4 ranked Tulane dropped its last two conference games to UTSA and Charlotte. In the first season, my alma mater, the University of North Texas, made the 12-team College Football Playoff despite only having three winning seasons since 2010. That season also saw Texas A&M win the National Championship -- a true immersion breaker because the real-life A&M has yet to make an appearance in the SEC Championship.\n\nUnlike Dynasty, the happenings of the world around you don't have much to do with you since you don't have to deal with things like recruiting and roster management. Plus, historically, RTG has been a rather shallow experience. However, thanks to the addition of the transfer portal, you can change your team at the end of every season to create some interesting scenarios in your career.\n\nSection written by Chance Townsend\n\nWhat's left to cover in this review is the Ultimate Team mode or CUT (College Ultimate Team). While I've never cared for Ultimate Team in any game, this version of EA's favorite money collector isn't as in your face as its other offerings like EAFC or Madden. We didn't play around much with CUT during our play testing, so our review is limited, however, it must be said that for those new to the Frostbite Engine era of EA sports games, CUT is the perfect place to start.\n\nNot because that's where EA wants you to spend money, but because the offering of solo challenges is an excellent way to get used to the different playbooks and schemes that can be used in other modes like Dynasty. It's the perfect training ground to get a feel of what kind of style you'd want to play for whenever you decide to take the reigns at a bottom-barrel MAC program. Each playbook offers different challenges, like the Air Raid that asks you to use a hurry-up offense and pass for five straight plays.\n\nTo keep things brief, if you love college football, this game you're waiting for. As a pure gameplay experience, CFB 25 is both challenging and rewarding in ways that Madden and 2K aren't. However, it's not the game we've waited 11 years for. Dynasty lacks a lot of depth and quality-of-life changes that were present in NCAA 14, alongside a mind-numbingly inane UI and drumline menu songs.\n\nEA Orlando promised fans that this is the college football game they deserve, and considering it has all the trappings of an EA sports game, they weren't lying. But if you can look past that and just focus on what's in the game, you'll have a fun time.", "source": {"uri": "mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

That's former Harrisburg quarterback Jacob Knuth, playing for Kansas State in a game at Wisconsin that I set up on the new EA Sports College Football 25 for Playstation 5. Wearing No. 19 in red for the Badgers is former Sioux Falls Jefferson linebacker Thomas Heiberger.\n\nKnuth and Heiberger are two of the first wave of college football players ever to be featured in a video game with Monday's pre-release of the first college football video game to hit the market since 2014.\n\nEA Sports made an NCAA licensed game (similar to but unique from the NFL Madden series) for years, but when the name-image-likeness debate started to heat up and lawsuits started getting thrown around, EA Sports (probably wisely) ceased making the game.\n\nBack then the game would feature the likeness of real college players, but could not use their names. I remember playing the 2006 version on PS2 with Oklahoma and dominating behind an unstoppable running back who was obviously molded after Adrian Peterson, but identified only by his jersey number.\n\nNow, after years of the game being dormant on the sidelines as the courts weighed college athletes' NIL demands, the college football game franchise is back.\n\nIt features every team in the Football Bowl Subdivision (I-A), and every player on every roster was given the opportunity to 'opt in' to the game, in exchange for $600 and a free copy of the game.\n\nI bought the deluxe edition of the game to get my hands on it early, and have spent the better part of the last two days playing it, for research/journalism purposes of course.\n\nIf you care enough to read this you've probably already seen/heard/read several reviews of the game, most of which seem to be overflowing with praise. That seems about right to me. A couple days in and yeah, it looks, sounds, feels and plays awesome.\n\nTechnology has jumped quite a bit since the last version of the game, as the Playstation 5 renders the stadiums, players and animations with stunning detail. Chris Fowler, David Pollack and Jesse Palmer are on the call, and their commentary sounds fluid and natural. If you play this game when there are other people around, they will mistake it for an actual televised football game.\n\nOne thing the game always got right before and definitely wanted to nail again is the pageantry of college football, and '25' delivers. I've already played games at the home stadiums of Alabama, Oklahoma State, Penn State, Florida, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Illinois and Northwestern, and the atmosphere the game creates is extremely impressive. When I took Northwestern (I'll explain why I was playing as the Wildcats in a minute) to Beaver Stadium and the controller vibrated and the screen shook as the sound of 110,000 fans roared when the Nittany Lions took the field, I actually said 'Holy Sh*t' to myself out loud, as a slight shiver went down my spine. It was unbelievably cool.\n\nThe first game I set up was Tennessee vs. Alabama, as I wanted to see Josh Heupel against Kalen DeBoer in a battle of South Dakota boys who have gone on to the biggest of the big time. But unfortunately, the game does not include coaches. That seems like a major omission given that the coaches are much more 'main characters' in the college world than the pros, but I understand it, as it took enough haggling to get the players in the game. I can only imagine what hoops EA would've needed to jump through to add the coaches, too.\n\nThe game has a few modes/features. You can just play a one-off game, start a dynasty, where you create a coach and embark in building a program in painstaking detail, including scouting and recruiting high school players, managing the transfer portal, scheduling games and choosing schemes and playbooks.\n\nThere's also the Road to Glory mode, where you start as a high school player, get recruited, choose a school and then work your way up the depth chart. You can choose to start out as a 5-star blue chipper with sky-high expectations or as an underdog with little interest.\n\nI created myself as a 5-10 quarterback from Sioux Falls and 1-star recruit. I had offers from several Group of 5 schools, the option to walk-on at any major program, and one lone P5 scholarship offer, from Northwestern. I took it and joined the Wildcats as the 4th string QB.\n\nFrom there your player is given a multitude of tasks, from studying for tests, practicing, social activities, fielding NIL opportunities and texting with teammates, coaches and reporters all as you try to improve enough to get on the field. It's ridiculously detailed and in-depth -- at one point I was given the option to sabotage the starting QB's alarm clock to get him in trouble and help my own standing (I declined). In another instance, a sorority girl asked my character to violate curfew to go to a party. Let's just say the virtual version of me is more disciplined than the real life one.\n\nI spent my entire redshirt year no higher than 3rd on the depth chart as the Wildcats went 4-8.\n\nBy year two I was able to get into a battle for the QB2 spot, which took me several practice competitions to win. By week 10, the 4-5 Wildcats gave me an opportunity to start, and after I won the job I finally got into a game and immediately led Northwestern to an upset of Michigan, and eventually, four straight wins including a blowout of Jacksonville State in the Quick Lane Bowl.\n\nBurning through those two seasons only took a few hours, but I did spend more time doing the off-field tasks than playing actual football. It got a little tedious at times.\n\nThere are local kids in the game, obviously, and it definitely feels a little surreal. There's Knuth, listed as No. 2 on the K-State depth chart, and Heiberger down a ways at linebacker for Wisconsin. Lincoln Kienholz for Ohio State, Nash Hutmacher at Nebraska, and I'm sure there's more South Dakota kids I'm forgetting.\n\nWhat the game does not have are FCS schools. As much as I have been slow to endorse the idea that North Dakota State and South Dakota State need to make the jump to FBS sooner than later, I have to admit it annoyed me greatly to see teams like Kennesaw State, Sam Houston, Troy, UMass and others that the Jacks would destroy get to be in the game.\n\nTo get around that, I planned on using the game's much-hyped Team Builder, which allows users to create their own school, fictional or otherwise, to insert into the game to play their dynasty.\n\nUnfortunately that piece of the game is not available yet.\n\nWhen it is, users will be able to create their own team, and I've read (unconfirmed) reports that they can create several at a time. So if one wanted to, they could build the entire NSIC or MVFC or Ivy League, or create all the tiny Division III schools in Michigan. Stay tuned on that, I guess.\n\nEither way, the game itself is cool as hell. EA Sports had 11 years to work on this thing and it's hard to quibble with much, assuming the Team Builder mode and other features are eventually ironed out.\n\nMonday's launch felt like a nationwide cultural event, as my social media timeline was dominated by fans and media devouring the game. Hopefully it will provide us with more to chew on as the season goes along. In the meantime, I'm not usually one to start getting excited about football in mid-July but after just a couple hours of playing '25' I'm pretty pumped for that trip to Stillwater in six weeks.

But when new versions were discontinued in 2013 amid a nasty gridlock of legal battles, fans were devastated.\n\nNow, more than a decade later, hardcore users are rejoicing in its return.\n\n\"When the clock struck midnight on the new year, all I could think about was that it was finally coming back,\" diehard fan Richard Clemens, 25, of Norwalk, Connecticut, told The Post.\n\nHe added that next to getting engaged, playing the collegiate gridiron franchise again -- one that ran for 21 years before being halted -- is \"the highlight of my year.\"\n\nThe beloved game fumbled 11 years ago when the NCAA canceled its brand licensing contract and, in addition, EA Sports and Collegiate Licensing Company faced paying a $40 million settlement for improper use of student athletes' names and likenesses.\n\nA friend of Clemens, Eric Kosh, 26, called it \"massively disappointing\" to no longer be able to play a college football video game as a university student himself at the time.\n\n\"It was gutting. We would have been hosting tournaments all the time in our dorm,\" Kosh told The Post, adding that he held on to his now-outdated PlayStation 3 console to keep scoring with the old games since.\n\nBut in 2021, the NCAA changed its rules on Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) rights, allowing student-athletes to profit from brand usage -- which finally paved the way for new games.\n\n\"The fan reaction was as if everyone in America won the lottery at the same time,\" Clemens said.\n\nThe manufacturer certainly scored a touchdown: Presales of the $70 game -- with three-day early access for $90 -- netted a whopping $70 million on its first recent sneak-peek day, reported Barstool Sports.\n\nThe collegiate-level game -- featuring 134 universities to choose from -- always rivaled that of its pro-football brethren, the uber-popular \"John Madden Football\" and \"Madden NFL\" series, which only offered 32 cookie-cutter teams.\n\n\"You can't compare the two at all. 'College Football' blows 'Madden' out of the water,\" avid 24-year-old player Anthony Pantino of Bethpage, New York, told The Post.\n\nLike Kosh, he kept his antiquated Xbox 360 running to play old versions of his longtime fave.\n\nThe game even allows players to build a \"college football dynasty from the ground up as a coach,\" an intricate aspect that lured Pantino since he first \"fell in love\" with the game in 2007.\n\n\"Being better than Nick Saban is the goal,\" he said with pride of the legendary Alabama coach who retired early this year.\n\nPantino admitted that he could spend an entire weekend building his virtual football program for the much-anticipated return of the state-of-the-art game.\n\n\"Madden doesn't give you that kind of depth,\" he said, adding that \"College Football\" offers a player \"a true feeling of accomplishment.\"\n\nFor other diehards like Kosh, this game is no child's play, either.

Users need to know where to search for the top players in the country as well as where to find hidden gems to boost their program's stock.\n\nThat's where pipelines come into play. Players will generally find the best recruits in the top pipelines, allowing coaches to maximize their rosters for the present and future of the program.\n\nIf you're looking to create a championship team in College Football 25, look no further for the best pipelines. Here's all you need to know.\n\nMORE: When does EA Sports College Football 25 release?\n\nThe best pipelines are mostly objective, though there is a little variance to it. Top recruits can be anywhere around the country, but they generally stick in a few locations.\n\nIf you're looking to maximize the success of your program, recruit in these pipelines:\n\nBecause so many recruits come from these states, there are additional pipelines within the states. Central, North and South Florida are all great options to recruit at. North, East and Southwest Texas are among the best, too.\n\nAside from the big three states listed above, Georgia is a solid option as well. Between South Georgia and Metro Atlanta, users have two solid choices to use in Dynasty Mode.\n\nMORE: How to access EA Sports College Football 25 early?\n\nPipeline in EA Sports College Football 25 is a region or state in the United States that schools and coaches have an advantage in recruitment. There are 50 pipelines in the game, which means not all 50 states are covered.\n\nInstead, there are multiple regions within popular states such as California, Texas and Florida. Many top prospects originate from these states and regions within them.\n\nCoaches and schools will have advantages in recruiting in specific pipelines around the country. For example, if a coach chooses a pipeline in Metro Atlanta, they'll have a better chance at drawing top recruits to their school, regardless of which program they run.\n\nMORE: Who are the highest-rated players in EA Sports College Football 25?\n\nPipelines are a unique addition to College Football 25 that generally isn't seen in other sports games. It's strictly for Dynasty Mode, which is the portion of the game that allows a user to become a coach and lead a school's football program to glory.\n\nWhen creating a coach in College Football 25, you select a designated pipeline to have an advantage in recruiting. Each school also has a specific pipeline. The coach and school don't have to have the same pipeline, though pairing them will give better recruitment skills in that region.\n\nPipelines don't limit one's recruitment, however. If you have a pipeline in North Florida, you can still recruit in California. You might just have a decreased chance of landing that top prospect if a program with a California pipeline joins in the recruitment process.\n\nMORE: Travis Hunter sends unnecessary shot at Colorado offensive line\n\nIt's not as simple as chasing after the top high school player in the country. College Football 25 has an evolved recruitment process that requires consistent action.\n\nThe first step, of course, is choosing which players to target. There's hundreds of players to choose from each new recruiting year, so it could be difficult to comb through. The recruitment menu allows users to sort by multiple different categories including the player's interest level, star rating, pipeline, whether they fit a positional need for your squad and more.\n\nIn order to take the next step in the recruitment process, users will have to begin swaying the prospects into joining their program. There are only a certain number of hours per week that a coach can use on recruitment, so choose wisely who to spend them on.\n\nIn addition to learning more about the players and swaying them to come to the school, there are dealbreakers which must be met in order to land the recruit. It's very unlikely to land a recruit if they aren't met.\n\nSome actions to influence a player's decision include sending a DM to the player on social media or reaching out to his family or friends. Coaches can also send scholarships but are limited 35 offers each season.\n\nDynasty Mode is extremely in-depth, especially in the recruitment process. It'll take a lot of real-time hours to rebuild a program into a college football dynasty.

Georgia Tech is five weeks away from facing Florida State in the first game of the season and it is starting to finally feel like football season.\n\nThis week, EA Sports gave a gift to all college football fans with the release of EA Sports College Football 25, the first college football video game in over a decade. It was a moment that many college football fans had been waiting on for a long time.\n\nAfter not seeing much about Georgia Tech in the video game previews leading up to the release, but Yellow Jackets fans finally got to see what it was like playing with their favorite team.\n\nAfter having a few days to play the game, Georgia Tech is one of the funnest teams to play with in the game. Having a mobile quarterback is a huge plus in this game and Haynes King is one of the best in the game. The playbook is all around very solid, Jamal Haynes is a great running back to use, and there are multiple weapons on the offense to use in a variety of ways. The offensive line is very good as well. Defense is a big challenge with any team in the game right now.\n\nOn today's episode of Bleav Georgia Tech, RJ and Jackson discuss their first impressions of EA Sports College Football 25. They also talk about the four Georgia Tech players being drafted in the 2024 MLB Draft, the upcoming commitment of four-star offensive lineman Cortez Smith, and they give a good preview of what to expect from Brent Key, Haynes King, Jamal Haynes, and Zeek Biggers at ACC Media Days on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tech", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Key", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brent Key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Dodd_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Dodd Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse_Orange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Syracuse Orange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Seminoles_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Seminoles football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Football (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haynes_King_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haynes King (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Coast Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Developers_and_Publishers/Independent_Developers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Developers and Publishers/Independent Developers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2152,h_1210,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_yellow_jackets/01j35sdb8zswv9erwccn.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741718", "eventUri": "eng-9741718", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-11-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

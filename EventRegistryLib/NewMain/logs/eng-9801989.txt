India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development,\" PM Modi wrote on X.\n\nHasina quit earlier this week after several chaotic weeks that began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favoured people with connections to Hasina's party. the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasina's 15-year rule as more than 450 people including students were killed amid spiralling violence.\n\nIndia on Thursday expressed hope for the early restoration of law and order in Bangladesh and said the country's interests are foremost for the Indian government. Yunus had criticised India's close relationship with Hasina, saying it \"earned the enmity of the Bangladeshi people\" but said there will be several opportunities to heal these rifts.\n\n\"Although some countries, such as India, backed the ousted prime minister and earned the enmity of the Bangladeshi people as a result, there will be many opportunities to heal these kinds of rifts and to resume bilateral alliances and close friendships soon,\" he wrote in an article in The Economist.\n\n(with ANI inputs)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u20132020_Hong_Kong_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2019\u20132020 Hong Kong protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidential palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladeshis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/08/bangladesh-oath-1723184106.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801989", "eventUri": "eng-9801989", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 322, "textEnd": 330}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus led a solemn tribute to Bangladesh's fallen independence heroes on August 9 in the first act of his interim government, after a student-led uprising forced predecessor Sheikh Hasina into exile. Yunus, 84, was sworn in on Thursday night after returning home from Europe at the request of protest leaders, following the sudden end of Hasina's 15-year rule.\n\nAFP / Indranil Mukherjee\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh -- Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and his newly named interim government set out Friday to restore \"law and order\" after a student-led uprising and deadly mass protests forced predecessor Sheikh Hasina into exile.\n\nA day after returning home from Europe and vowing to \"uphold, support and protect the constitution\" as he was sworn into office, 84-year-old Yunus began the tough challenge of returning the country to democracy.\n\n\"The number one challenge is the law and order,\" Touhid Hossain, who has taken over the foreign ministry portfolio, told reporters. \"If it is ensured, the rest will be fine.\"\n\nHasina, 76, accused of widespread human rights abuses including the jailing of her political opponents, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her 15-year rule.\n\nThe military announced her resignation and then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.\n\nYunus, who has taken the title of \"chief advisor\" to the caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, has said he wants to hold elections \"within a few months\".\n\nWhen polls might take place is not clear.\n\nOfficials of Hasina's former ruling party, the Awami League, have gone into hiding after revenge attacks saw some of their offices torched, while former opposition groups such as the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are rebuilding after years of crushing repression.\n\nSeveral of Yunus' advisers are loosely affiliated with the BNP, led by Hasina's longtime rival and former premier Khaleda Zia, 78, newly released after years of house arrest.\n\n'Forge reconciliation'\n\nYunus wrote in The Economist this week that his country needed a new generation of leaders \"who are not obsessed with settling scores, as too many of our previous governments were\".\n\nFor Syeda Rizwana Hasan, a top environmental activist and lawyer appointed to oversee climate change affairs, the transition offers a chance to change the country's political course.\n\n\"My plan is to lay the foundation to put Bangladesh on a truly liberal democratic path,\" she said.\n\nThat desire for change was echoed by former student leader Nahid Islam, now information adviser in the cabinet.\n\n\"This government has been made through a mass uprising, and people have that trust,\" 26-year-old Islam said.\n\n\"Our goal is to reconstruct the Bangladesh that we dreamt in the fastest possible time.\"\n\nBut the new administration faces a daunting task.\n\nYunus has called for the restoration of order in the South Asian nation after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\nUN country chief Gwyn Lewis on Friday praised Yunus' \"calls for calm and peace\", adding she would \"work with all parties to forge reconciliation\".\n\n'Victory day'\n\nHasina's flight abroad has heightened rancour towards India, which played a decisive military role in securing Bangladesh's independence, but also backed Hasina to the hilt.\n\nHer son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told the Times of India newspaper his mother still had hope of contesting political office.\n\n\"She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election,\" he said.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to offer his \"best wishes\" to Yunus on Thursday moments after he was sworn in, saying New Delhi was \"committed\" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.\n\nIndia's arch-rival Pakistan on Friday also said it hoped it could boost ties with Dhaka, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wishing Yunus \"great success in guiding Bangladesh towards a harmonious and prosperous future\".\n\nChina said Friday it also welcomed the interim government, promising to work with the country \"to promote exchange and cooperation\".\n\nIn driving rain, Yunus carried out his first duty as leader, standing silently alongside student and civil society leaders.\n\nTogether the group laid a wreath in the red-and-green colours of the national flag at the main memorial commemorating the millions who died in Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.\n\nYunus suggested on his arrival in Dhaka on Thursday that Hasina's ouster was as significant as the conflict that brought Bangladesh into being.\n\n\"Bangladesh has created a new victory day,\" he told reporters. \"Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philstar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

AFP-Yonhap\n\nNobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took the oath of office as head of Bangladesh's interim government Thursday after protests forced out former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina this week.\n\nThe key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in Bangladesh and preparing for new elections following the ouster of Hasina, who fled to India after weeks of student protests over job quotas grew into an uprising against her increasingly autocratic 15-year rule.\n\nThe figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief adviser, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in the presence of diplomats, civil society members, top businessmen and members of the former opposition party at the presidential palace in Dhaka. No representatives of Hasina's party were present.\n\nThe 16 other members of the interim Cabinet were drawn mainly from civil society and include two of the student protest leaders. The Cabinet members were chosen in discussions this week among student leaders, civil society representatives and the military.\n\nThe protests began in July against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina's party. But she resigned and fled to India on Monday after the protests coalesced into a movement against her government and more than 300 people including students and police officers were killed in the spiraling violence.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his best wishes to Yunus in a statement on social media platform X, and alluded to reports that Hindus in Muslim-majority Bangladesh had been targeted during the violence.\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" Modi said. \"India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.\"\n\nYunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in Paris for the Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role. He called for calm and an end to partisan violence before he returned home earlier Thursday.\n\nIn his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. \"Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,\" Yunus said, flanked by student leaders. \"It has immense possibility.\"\n\nBangladeshi President Mohammed Shahabuddin administers oath-taking ceremony of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as the countr's head of the interim government in Bangladesh at the Bangabhaban, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Aug. 8. Reuters-Yonhap\n\nYunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a \"bloodsucker\" allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.\n\nOn Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.\n\nThe president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration.\n\nThe quick move to select Yunus came when Hasina's resignation created a vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule and myriad crises.\n\nHasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, has vowed that his family and the Awami League party would remain engaged in Bangladesh's politics despite what he said have been attacks on the Awami League party over the past week. Many observers see Joy as Hasina's successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nation's politics.\n\n\"If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League,\" he said. \"The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh.\"\n\nHasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, but the vote was boycotted by her main opponents, thousands of opposition members were jailed beforehand, and the U.S. and U.K. denounced the result as not credible. Hasina's critics say her administration increasingly was marked by human rights abuses and corruption.\n\nThe chaos on Bangladesh's streets continued after her resignation on Monday. Dozens of police officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured.\n\nOvernight into Thursday, residents across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighborhoods amid reports of robberies. Communities used loudspeakers in mosques to alert people that robberies were occurring, and police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for people seeking help.\n\nMany have feared Hasina's departure could trigger even more instability in the nation of some 170 million people, already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.\n\nChina and the United States have both welcomed the new government.\n\n\"We think the interim government will play a vital role in establishing long-term peace and political stability in Bangladesh,\" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters. He also reiterated that the government's decisions \"should respect democratic principles, rule of law, and the will of the Bangladeshi people.\"\n\nChina said it stood ready to work with Bangladesh to promote bilateral cooperation and advance their strategic partnership. \"We respect Bangladesh's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and the development path independently chosen by the Bangladeshi people,\" the Foreign Ministry statement said.

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took the oath of office as head of Bangladesh's interim government Thursday after protests forced out former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina this week.\n\nDhaka, Aug 9 (AP) Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took the oath of office as head of Bangladesh's interim government Thursday after protests forced out former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina this week.\n\nThe key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in Bangladesh and preparing for new elections following the ouster of Hasina, who fled to India after weeks of student protests over job quotas grew into an uprising against her increasingly autocratic 15-year rule.\n\nAlso Read | Live News Updates Today.\n\nThe figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief adviser, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in the presence of diplomats, civil society members, top businessmen and members of the former opposition party at the presidential palace in Dhaka. No representatives of Hasina's party were present.\n\nThe 16 other members of the interim Cabinet were drawn mainly from civil society and include two of the student protest leaders. The Cabinet members were chosen in discussions this week among student leaders, civil society representatives and the military.\n\nAlso Read | 'Hope for Safety and Protection of Hindus': PM Narendra Modi Extends Best Wishes to Muhammad Yunus As He Takes Oath As Head of Interim Government in Bangladesh.\n\nThe protests began in July against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina's party. But she resigned and fled to India on Monday after the protests coalesced into a movement against her government and more than 300 people including students and police officers were killed in the spiraling violence.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his best wishes to Yunus in a statement on social media platform X, and alluded to reports that Hindus in Muslim-majority Bangladesh had been targeted during the violence.\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" Modi said. \"India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.\"\n\nYunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in Paris for the Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role. He called for calm and an end to partisan violence before he returned home earlier Thursday.\n\nIn his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. \"Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,\" Yunus said, flanked by student leaders. \"It has immense possibility.\"\n\nYunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a \"bloodsucker\" allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.\n\nOn Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.\n\nThe president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration.\n\nThe quick move to select Yunus came when Hasina's resignation created a vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule and myriad crises.\n\nMany fear that Hasina's departure could trigger even more instability in the nation of some 170 million people, already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.\n\nHasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, has vowed that his family and the Awami League party would remain engaged in Bangladesh's politics despite what he said have been attacks on the Awami League party over the past week. Many observers see Joy as Hasina's successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nation's politics.\n\n\"If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League,\" he said. \"The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh.\"\n\nHasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, but the vote was boycotted by her main opponents, thousands of opposition members were jailed beforehand, and the U.S. and U.K. denounced the result as not credible. Hasina's critics say her administration increasingly was marked by human rights abuses and corruption.\n\nThe chaos on Bangladesh's streets continued after her resignation on Monday. Dozens of police officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured.\n\nOvernight into Thursday, residents across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighborhoods amid reports of robberies. Communities used loudspeakers in mosques to alert people that robberies were occurring, and police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for people seeking help.

No representatives of Hasina's party were present.\n\nSixteen other people have been included in the interim Cabinet with members drawn mainly from civil society and including two of the student protest leaders. The Cabinet members were chosen in discussions this week among student leaders, civil society representatives and the military.\n\nHasina quit on Monday after several chaotic weeks that began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina's party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasina's 15-year rule, as more than 300 people including students were killed amid spiraling violence.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his best wishes to Yunus in a statement on the social media platform X, and alluded to reports that Hindus in Muslim-majority Bangladesh had been targeted during the country's unrest in recent days.\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" Modi said. \"India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.\"\n\nYunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in the French capital for the 2024 Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role, and returned home earlier Thursday to tight security at the airport in Dhaka.\n\nIn his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. \"Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,\" Yunus said, flanked by student leaders. \"It has immense possibility.\"\n\nOn Wednesday in Paris, Yunus had called for calm and an end to all partisan violence.\n\nHasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, vowed Wednesday that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladesh's politics -- a reversal from what he'd said earlier in the week after Hasina stepped down Monday and fled to India.\n\nThe president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration.\n\nOn Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.\n\nYunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a \"bloodsucker\" allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.\n\nJoy said in a social media post on Wednesday that his family would return to politics despite what he said have been attacks on the Awami League party over the past week. Many observers see Joy as Hasina's successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nation's politics.\n\n\"If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League,\" he said. \"The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh.\"", "source": {"uri": "arkansasonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArkansasOnline"},

Yunus began the tough challenge of returning the country to democracy.\n\n\"The number one challenge is the law and order,\" Touhid Hossain, who has taken over the foreign ministry portfolio, told reporters. \"If it is ensured, the rest will be fine.\"\n\nHasina, 76, accused of widespread human rights abuses including the jailing of her political opponents, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her 15-year rule.\n\nThe military announced her resignation and then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.\n\nYunus, who has taken the title of \"chief advisor\" to the caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, has said he wants to hold elections \"within a few months\".\n\nWhen polls might take place is not clear.\n\nOfficials of Hasina's former ruling party, the Awami League, have gone into hiding after revenge attacks saw some of their offices torched, while former opposition groups such as the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are rebuilding after years of crushing repression.\n\nSeveral of Yunus' advisers are loosely affiliated with the BNP, led by Hasina's longtime rival and former premier Khaleda Zia, 78, newly released after years of house arrest.\n\nYunus wrote in The Economist this week that his country needed a new generation of leaders \"who are not obsessed with settling scores, as too many of our previous governments were\".\n\nFor Syeda Rizwana Hasan, a top environmental activist and lawyer appointed to oversee climate change affairs, the transition offers a chance to change the country's political course.\n\n\"My plan is to lay the foundation to put Bangladesh on a truly liberal democratic path,\" she said.\n\nThat desire for change was echoed by former student leader Nahid Islam, now information adviser in the cabinet.\n\n\"This government has been made through a mass uprising, and people have that trust,\" 26-year-old Islam said.\n\n\"Our goal is to reconstruct the Bangladesh that we dreamt in the fastest possible time.\"\n\nBut the new administration faces a daunting task.\n\nYunus has called for the restoration of order in the South Asian nation after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\nUN country chief Gwyn Lewis on Friday praised Yunus' \"calls for calm and peace\", adding she would \"work with all parties to forge reconciliation\".\n\nHasina's flight abroad has heightened rancour towards India, which played a decisive military role in securing Bangladesh's independence, but also backed Hasina to the hilt.\n\nHer son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told the Times of India newspaper his mother still had hope of contesting political office.\n\n\"She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election,\" he said.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to offer his \"best wishes\" to Yunus on Thursday moments after he was sworn in, saying New Delhi was \"committed\" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.\n\nIndia's arch-rival Pakistan on Friday also said it hoped it could boost ties with Dhaka, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wishing Yunus \"great success in guiding Bangladesh towards a harmonious and prosperous future\".\n\nChina said Friday it also welcomed the interim government, promising to work with the country \"to promote exchange and cooperation\".\n\nIn driving rain, Yunus carried out his first duty as leader, standing silently alongside student and civil society leaders.\n\nTogether the group laid a wreath in the red-and-green colours of the national flag at the main memorial commemorating the millions who died in Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.\n\nYunus suggested on his arrival in Dhaka on Thursday that Hasina's ouster was as significant as the conflict that brought Bangladesh into being.\n\n\"Bangladesh has created a new

AP\n\nNobel laureate Muhammad Yunus led a solemn tribute to Bangladesh's fallen independence heroes in the first act of his interim government on Friday, after a student-led uprising forced predecessor Sheikh Hasina into exile.\n\nA day after returning home from Europe and vowing to \"uphold, support and protect the constitution\" as he was sworn into office, 84-year-old Yunus began the tough challenge of returning the country to democracy.\n\nHasina, 76, accused of widespread human rights abuses including the jailing of her political opponents, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her 15-year rule.\n\nThe military announced her resignation then agreed to student demands that Yunus - who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work - lead an interim government.\n\nYunus, who has taken the title of \"chief advisor\" to a caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, has said he wants to hold elections \"within a few months\".\n\nWhen polls might take place is not clear.\n\nOfficials of Hasina's former ruling party, the Awami League, have gone into hiding after revenge attacks saw some of their offices torched, while former opposition groups such as the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are rebuilding after years of crushing repression.\n\nThe veteran economist has called for the restoration of order in the South Asian nation after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\nIn driving rain, Yunus stood silently on Friday alongside student and civil society leaders in the new \"advisory\" cabinet tasked with steering democratic reforms.\n\nTogether the group laid a wreath in the red-and-green colours of the national flag at the main memorial commemorating the millions who died in Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.\n\nYunus suggested on his arrival on Thursday in Dhaka that Hasina's ouster was as significant as the conflict that brought Bangladesh into being.\n\n\"Bangladesh has

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took the oath of office as head of Bangladesh's interim government Thursday after protests forced out former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina this week.\n\nThe key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in Bangladesh and preparing for new elections following the ouster of Hasina, who fled to India after weeks of student protests over job quotas grew into an uprising against her increasingly autocratic 15-year rule.\n\nThe figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief adviser, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in the presence of diplomats, civil society members, top businessmen and members of the former opposition party at the presidential palace in Dhaka. No representatives of Hasina's party were present.\n\nThe 16 other members of the interim Cabinet were drawn mainly from civil society and included two of the student protest leaders. The Cabinet members were chosen in discussions this week among student leaders, civil society representatives and the military.\n\nThe protests began in July against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina's party. But she resigned and fled to India on Monday after the protests coalesced into a movement against her government and more than 300 people including students and police officers were killed in the spiraling violence.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his best wishes to Yunus in a statement on social media platform X, and alluded to reports that Hindus in Muslim-majority Bangladesh had been targeted during the violence.\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" Modi said. \"India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.\"\n\nYunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in Paris for the Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role. He called for calm and an end to partisan violence before he returned home earlier Thursday.\n\nIn his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. \"Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,\" Yunus said, flanked by student leaders. \"It has immense possibility.\"\n\nYunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a \"bloodsucker\" allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.\n\nOn Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.\n\nThe president had dissolved parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration.\n\nThe quick move to select Yunus came when Hasina's resignation created a vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule and myriad crises.\n\nHasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, has vowed that his family and the Awami League party would remain engaged in Bangladesh's politics despite what he said have been attacks on the Awami League party over the past week. Many observers see Joy as Hasina's successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nation's politics.\n\n\"If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League,\" he said. \"The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh.\"\n\nHasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, but the vote was boycotted by her main opponents, thousands of opposition members were jailed beforehand, and the US and UK denounced the result as not credible. Hasina's critics say her administration increasingly was marked by human rights abuses and corruption.\n\nThe chaos on Bangladesh's streets continued after her resignation on Monday. Dozens of police officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured.\n\nOvernight into Thursday, residents across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighborhoods amid reports of robberies. Communities used loudspeakers in mosques to alert people that robberies were occurring, and police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for people seeking help.\n\nMany have feared Hasina's departure could trigger even more instability in the nation of some 170 million people, already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.\n\nChina and the United States have both welcomed the new government.\n\n\"We think the interim government will play a vital role in establishing long-term peace and political stability in Bangladesh,\" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters. He also reiterated that the government's decisions \"should respect democratic principles, rule of law, and the will of the Bangladeshi people.\"\n\nChina said it stood ready to work with Bangladesh to promote bilateral cooperation and advance their strategic partnership. \"We respect Bangladesh's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and the development path independently chosen by the Bangladeshi people,\" the Foreign Ministry statement said.

Bangladesh Interim Leader", "body": "Muhammad Yunus has called for the restoration of order after weeks of violence that left 455 people dead, urging citizens to guard each other.\n\nMuhammad Yunus stood alongside student and civil society leaders in the new \"advisory\" cabinet.\n\nDhaka:\n\nNobel laureate Muhammad Yunus led a solemn tribute to Bangladesh's fallen independence heroes in the first act of his interim government on Friday, after a student-led uprising forced predecessor Sheikh Hasina into exile.\n\nA day after returning home from Europe and vowing to \"uphold, support and protect the constitution\" as he was sworn into office, 84-year-old Yunus began the tough challenge of returning the country to democracy.\n\nHasina, 76, accused of widespread human rights abuses including the jailing of her political opponents, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her 15-year rule.\n\nThe military announced her resignation and then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.\n\nYunus, who has taken the title of \"chief advisor\" to a caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, has said he wants to hold elections \"within a few months\".\n\nWhen polls might take place is not clear.\n\nOfficials of Hasina's former ruling party, the Awami League, have gone into hiding after revenge attacks saw some of their offices torched, while former opposition groups such as the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are rebuilding after years of crushing repression.\n\n'Victory day'\n\nThe new administration faces a daunting task.\n\nThe veteran economist has called for the restoration of order in the South Asian nation after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\nIn driving rain, Yunus stood silently on Friday alongside student and civil society leaders in the new \"advisory\" cabinet tasked with steering democratic reforms.\n\nTogether the group laid a wreath in the red-and-green colours of the national flag at the main memorial commemorating the millions who died in Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.\n\nYunus suggested on his arrival on Thursday in Dhaka that Hasina's ouster was as significant as the conflict that brought Bangladesh into being.\n\n\"Bangladesh has created a new victory day,\" he told reporters. \"Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"\n\nSeveral of Yunus' advisers are loosely affiliated with the BNP, led by Hasina's longtime rival and former premier Khaleda Zia, 78, newly released from years of house arrest.\n\nThey also include student leaders who started the protests.\n\nYunus wrote in The Economist this week that his country needed a new generation of leaders \"who are not obsessed with settling scores, as too many of our previous governments were\".\n\nHowever, Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told the Times of India newspaper his mother still had hope of contesting for political office.\n\n\"She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election,\" he said.\n\n'Law and order'\n\nHasina's flight abroad has heightened rancour towards India, which played a decisive military role in securing Bangladesh's independence but also backed Hasina to the hilt.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to offer his \"best wishes\" to Yunus on Thursday moments after he was sworn in, saying New Delhi was \"committed\" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.\n\nIndia's arch-rival Pakistan on Friday also said it hoped it could boost ties with Dhaka, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wishing Yunus \"great success in guiding Bangladesh towards a harmonious and prosperous future\".\n\nChina said Friday it also welcomed the interim government, promising to work with the country \"to promote exchange and cooperation\".\n\nFarida Akhter, an adviser to the interim government, told AFP that the group would also visit a monument in Dhaka where the student protests started last month.\n\n\"We are paying our respects there, as the student movement began from there,\" she said, before naming the top task on their to-do list.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n\"Our first priority is law and order\", she said.\n\n(Except for the

No representatives of Hasina's party were present.\n\nThe 16 other members of the interim Cabinet were drawn mainly from civil society and include two of the student protest leaders. The Cabinet members were chosen in discussions this week among student leaders, civil society representatives and the military.\n\nThe protests began in July against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina's party. But she resigned and fled to India on Monday after the protests coalesced into a movement against her government and more than 300 people including students and police officers were killed in the spiraling violence.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his best wishes to Yunus in a statement on social media platform X, and alluded to reports that Hindus in Muslim-majority Bangladesh had been targeted during the violence.\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" Modi said. \"India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.\"\n\nYunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in Paris for the Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role. He called for calm and an end to partisan violence before he returned home earlier Thursday.\n\nIn his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. \"Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,\" Yunus said, flanked by student leaders. \"It has immense possibility.\"\n\nYunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a \"bloodsucker\" allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.\n\nOn Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.\n\nThe president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration.\n\nThe quick move to select Yunus came when Hasina's resignation created a vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule and myriad crises.\n\nHasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, has vowed that his family and the Awami League party would remain engaged in Bangladesh's politics despite what he said have been attacks on the Awami League party over the past week. Many observers see Joy as Hasina's successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nation's politics.\n\n\"If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League,\" he said. \"The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh.\"\n\nHasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, but the vote was boycotted by her main opponents, thousands of opposition members were jailed beforehand, and the U.S. and U.K. denounced the result as not credible. Hasina's critics say her administration increasingly was marked by human rights abuses and corruption.\n\nThe chaos on Bangladesh's streets continued after her resignation on Monday. Dozens of police officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured.\n\nOvernight into Thursday, residents across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighborhoods amid reports of robberies. Communities used loudspeakers in mosques to alert people that robberies were occurring, and police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for people seeking help.\n\nMany have feared Hasina's departure could trigger even more instability in the nation of some 170 million people, already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.\n\nChina and the United States have both welcomed the new government.\n\n\"We think the interim government will play a vital role in establishing long-term peace and political stability in Bangladesh,\" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters. He also reiterated that the government's decisions \"should respect democratic principles, rule of law, and the will of the Bangladeshi people.\"\n\nChina said it stood ready to work with Bangladesh to promote bilateral cooperation and advance their strategic partnership. \"We respect Bangladesh's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and the development path independently chosen by the Bangladeshi people,\" the Foreign Ministry statement said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities.\"\n\nHe added, \"India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.\"\n\nYunus took oath as the head of an interim government today evening, replacing Sheikh Hasina who resigned as the prime minister and fled to India, leaving the country in turmoil following deadly protests against her government over a controversial quota system in jobs.\n\nYunus, 84, was administered the oath of office by President Mohammed Shahabuddin at a ceremony at the presidential palace 'Bangabhaban'.\n\nYunus was sworn in as the chief advisor - a position equivalent to prime minister.\n\nA 16-member council of advisers was announced to assist Yunus in running the state's affairs. Md. Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, two key organisers of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, were also part of the advisory council.\n\nWomen's rights activist Farida Akhtar, right-wing party Hefazat-e-Islam's deputy chief AFM Khalid Hossain, Grameen Telecom trustee Nurjahan Begum, freedom fighter Sharmeen Murshid, chairman of Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board Supradip Chakma, Prof Bidhan Ranjan Roy and former foreign secretary Touhid Hossain are among the advisory council members.\n\nRoy, Chakma and Bir Pratik Faruk-e-Azam could not take the oath as they were outside Dhaka.\n\nThe interim government will lead the country for a certain period and oversee the election to transition power to an elected government.\n\nAhead of taking the oath, Yunus promised to deliver a government which assures safety to its citizens and urged them to assist him in rebuilding the protest-torn country, as he described the ouster of Hasina as the country's \"second independence\".\n\nYunus, who was in Paris for the Olympic Games, returned to the country via Dubai on Thursday on an Emirates flight. Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, senior officials, student leaders and civil society members welcomed him at the airport.\n\n\"Today is a day of our pride,\" he said at an emotional press conference at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport after his arrival. \"We have got independence for the second time. We have to protect this independence.\" He expressed gratitude to the youth who made the protest movement against Hasina successful and said he would like to stress first to \"save the country from violence so that we can move forward on the path that the students have shown us.\" He urged people from all walks of life to listen to him and said he agreed to take charge of the interim administration responding to the call of the students and youths.\n\n\"If you have faith in me and trust me, then ensure that there will be no attack anywhere in the country. This is our first responsibility,\" he said at the crowded press briefing. \"If I can't do it and you do not listen to me, I don't have any utility here.\" He termed the anarchic activities and attacks on minority communities as \"part of a conspiracy\".\n\n\"We have to form a government which assures safety to its citizens,\" he said.\n\nYunus said the country was now in the hands of the young people.\n\n\"The nation is in your hands now. Now you have to rebuild it as per your aspirations. You have to use your creativity to build the country. You have earned independence for the country,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to change our state structure and remove all elements of fear from it so that people look at it and think that the state has been formed to safeguard them,\" Yunus added.\n\nBangladesh witnessed deadly unrest in recent weeks.

We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities.

The 84-year-old former banker landed in Dhaka on Thursday afternoon, hours before his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nAfter taking oath, Yunus said that he would \"uphold, support and protect the constitution and will perform my duties sincerely\".\n\nHis major role in the military-backed interim government became quite evident within hours of Sheikh Hasina's departure from the country on Monday amid massive anti-quota protests that had several lives.\n\nA well-known social entrepreneur, banker, and economist, Yunus is also hailed as the 'father of microfinance' for founding the Grameen Bank in 1983 and becoming the pioneer of microcredit and microfinance concepts.\n\nIn 2006, he and the bank were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their work to create economic and social development from below.\n\nAlthough Yunus was a well-known figure in Bangladesh, he had largely stayed away from the political arena, save one short-lived stint in February 2007, when he founded 'Nogarik Shakti' (citizens' power) before announcing his exit from politics in May 2007.\n\nHe also shared a tumultuous relationship with Sheikh Hasina, whom he accused of destroying the legacy of her father and Bangladesh founder, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\n\nBorn on June 28, 1940, in Chittagong district, Yunus did his schooling at the Chittagong Collegiate School before earning a bachelor's degree in economics from Dhaka University.\n\nHe later obtained a PhD in economics from Vanderbilt University in the USA on a Fulbright Scholarship in 1969.\n\nUpon returning to Bangladesh in 1972, Yunus became the head of the economics department at Chittagong University.\n\nFrom 1993 to 1995, Yunus was appointed by the UN Secretary-General as a member of the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women. He was also a prominent member of the Global Commission on Women's Health, the Advisory Council for Sustainable Economic Development, and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance.", "source": {"uri":

tackles 'law and order' as interim govt begins work", "body": "Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and his newly named interim government set out Friday to restore \"law and order\" after a student-led uprising and deadly mass protests forced predecessor Sheikh Hasina into exile.\n\nA day after returning home from Europe and vowing to \"uphold, support and protect the constitution\" as he was sworn into office, 84-year-old Yunus began the tough challenge of returning the country to democracy.\n\n\"The number one challenge is the law and order,\" Touhid Hossain, who has taken over the foreign ministry portfolio, told reporters. \"If it is ensured, the rest will be fine.\"\n\nHasina, 76, accused of widespread human rights abuses including the jailing of her political opponents, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her 15-year rule.\n\nThe military announced her resignation and then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.\n\nYunus, who has taken the title of \"chief advisor\" to the caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, has said he wants to hold elections \"within a few months\".\n\nWhen polls might take place is not clear.\n\nOfficials of Hasina's former ruling party, the Awami League, have gone into hiding after revenge attacks saw some of their offices torched, while former opposition groups such as the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are rebuilding after years of crushing repression.\n\nSeveral of Yunus' advisers are loosely affiliated with the BNP, led by Hasina's longtime rival and former premier Khaleda Zia, 78, newly released after years of house arrest.\n\n- 'Forge reconciliation' -\n\nYunus wrote in The Economist this week that his country needed a new generation of leaders \"who are not obsessed with settling scores, as too many of our previous governments were\".\n\nFor Syeda Rizwana Hasan, a top environmental activist and lawyer appointed to oversee climate change affairs, the transition offers a chance to change the country's political course.\n\n\"My plan is to lay the foundation to put Bangladesh on a truly liberal democratic path,\" she said.\n\nThat desire for change was echoed by former student leader Nahid Islam, now information adviser in the cabinet.\n\n\"This government has been made through a mass uprising, and people have that trust,\" 26-year-old Islam said.\n\n\"Our goal is to reconstruct the Bangladesh that we dreamt in the fastest possible time.\"\n\nBut the new administration faces a daunting task.\n\nYunus has called for the restoration of order in the South Asian nation after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\nUN country chief Gwyn Lewis on Friday praised Yunus' \"calls for calm and peace\", adding she would \"work with all parties to forge reconciliation\".\n\n- 'Victory day' -\n\nHasina's flight abroad has heightened rancour towards India, which played a decisive military role in securing Bangladesh's independence, but also backed Hasina to the hilt.\n\nHer son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told the Times of India newspaper his mother still had hope of contesting political office.\n\n\"She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election,\" he said.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to offer his \"best wishes\" to Yunus on Thursday moments after he was sworn in, saying New Delhi was \"committed\" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.\n\nIndia's arch-rival Pakistan on Friday also said it hoped it could boost ties with Dhaka, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wishing Yunus \"great success in guiding Bangladesh towards a harmonious and prosperous future\".\n\nChina said Friday it also welcomed the interim government, promising to work with the country \"to promote exchange and cooperation\".\n\nIn driving rain, Yunus carried out his first duty as leader, standing silently alongside student and civil society leaders.\n\nTogether the group laid a wreath in the red-and-green colours of the national flag at the main memorial commemorating the millions who died in Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.\n\nYunus suggested on his arrival in Dhaka on Thursday that Hasina's ouster was as significant as the conflict that brought Bangladesh into being.\n\n\"Bangladesh has created a new victory day,\" he told reporters. \"Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zawya.com"},

Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are rebuilding after years of crushing repression.\n\nThe veteran economist has called for the restoration of order in the South Asian nation after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\nIn driving rain, Yunus stood silently on Friday alongside student and civil society leaders in the new \"advisory\" cabinet tasked with steering democratic reforms.\n\nTogether the group laid a wreath in the red-and-green colours of the national flag at the main memorial commemorating the millions who died in Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.\n\nYunus suggested on his arrival on Thursday in Dhaka that Hasina's ouster was as significant as the conflict that brought Bangladesh into being.\n\n\"Bangladesh has created a new victory day,\" he told reporters. \"Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"\n\nSeveral of Yunus' advisers are loosely affiliated with the BNP, led by Hasina's longtime rival and former premier Khaleda Zia, 78, newly released from years of house arrest.\n\nThey also include student leaders who started the protests.\n\nYunus wrote in The Economist this week that his country needed a new generation of leaders \"who are not obsessed with settling scores, as too many of our previous governments were\".\n\nHowever, Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told the Times of India newspaper his mother still had hope of contesting political office.\n\n\"She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election,\" he said.\n\n- 'Law and order' -\n\nHasina's flight abroad has heightened rancour towards India, which played a decisive military role in securing Bangladesh's independence, but also backed Hasina to the hilt.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to offer his \"best wishes\" to Yunus on Thursday moments after he was sworn in, saying New Delhi was \"committed\" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.\n\nIndia's arch-rival Pakistan on Friday also said it hoped it could boost ties with Dhaka, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wishing Yunus \"great success in guiding Bangladesh towards a harmonious and prosperous future\".\n\nChina said Friday it also welcomed the interim government, promising to work with the country \"to promote exchange and cooperation\".\n\nFarida Akhter, an adviser to the interim government, told AFP that the group would also visit a monument in Dhaka where the student protests started last month.\n\n\"We are paying our respects there, as the student movement began from there,\" she said, before naming the top task on their to-do list.", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news",

We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities.

Yunus was attending the Paris Olympics as the country got engulfed in massive unrest and violence.\n\nThe 84-year-old former banker landed in Dhaka on Thursday afternoon, hours before his swearing-in ceremony. After taking oath, Yunus said that he would \"uphold, support and protect the constitution and will perform my duties sincerely\".\n\nHis major role in the military-backed interim government became quite evident within hours of Sheikh Hasina's departure from the country on Monday amid massive anti-quota protests that had several lives. A well-known social entrepreneur, banker, and economist, Yunus is also hailed as the 'father of microfinance' for founding the Grameen Bank in 1983 and becoming the pioneer of microcredit and microfinance concepts.\n\nIn 2006, he and the bank were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their work to create economic and social development from below. Although Yunus was a well-known figure in Bangladesh, he had largely stayed away from the political arena, save one short-lived stint in February 2007, when he founded 'Nogarik Shakti' (citizens' power) before announcing his exit from politics in May 2007.\n\nHe also shared a tumultuous relationship with Sheikh Hasina, whom he accused of destroying the legacy of her father and Bangladesh founder, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Born on June 28, 1940, in Chittagong district, Yunus did his schooling at the Chittagong Collegiate School before earning a bachelor's degree in economics from Dhaka University. He later obtained a PhD in economics from Vanderbilt University in the USA on a Fulbright Scholarship in 1969.\n\nUpon returning to Bangladesh in 1972, Yunus became the head of the economics department at Chittagong University. From 1993 to 1995, Yunus was appointed by the UN Secretary-General as a member of the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women. He was also a prominent member of the Global Commission on Women's Health, the Advisory Council for Sustainable Economic Development, and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance.", "source": {"uri":

(AP Photo/Rajib Dhar)\n\nThe key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in Bangladesh and preparing for new elections following weeks of violence in which student activists led an uprising against what was considered Hasina's increasingly autocratic 15-year rule.\n\nBangladesh's figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief advisor, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in presence of foreign diplomats, civil society members, top businessmen and members of the former opposition party at the presidential palace in Dhaka. No representatives of Hasina's party were present.\n\nSixteen other people have been included in the interim Cabinet with members drawn mainly from civil society and including two of the student protest leaders. The Cabinet members were chosen in discussions this week among student leaders, civil society representatives and the military.\n\nHasina quit on Monday after several chaotic weeks that began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina's party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasina's 15-year rule, as more than 300 people including students were killed amid spiraling violence.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his best wishes to Yunus in a statement on social media platform X, and alluded to reports that Hindus in Muslim-majority Bangladesh had been targeted during the country's unrest in recent days.\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" Modi said. \"India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.\"\n\nYunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in the French capital for the 2024 Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role, and returned home earlier Thursday to tight security at the airport in Dhaka.\n\nIn his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. \"Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,\" Yunus said, flanked by student leaders. \"It has immense possibility.\"\n\nOn Wednesday in Paris, Yunus had called for calm and an end to all partisan violence.\n\nHasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, vowed Wednesday that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladesh's politics -- a reversal from what he'd said earlier in the week after Hasina stepped down Monday and fled to India.\n\nThe president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration.\n\nOn Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.\n\nYunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a \"bloodsucker\" allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.\n\nThe chaos on Bangladesh's streets continued after Hasina's resignation on Monday. Dozens of police officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured. The looting of firearms also was reported in local media.\n\nThe unrest began in mid-July with protests over the quota system, but grew into a broader challenge over an administration that was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on opponents.\n\nJoy, Hasina's son, said in a social media post on Wednesday that his family would return to politics despite what he said have been attacks on the Awami League party over the past week. Many observers see Joy as Hasina's successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nation's politics.\n\n\"If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League,\" he said. \"The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh.\"\n\nOvernight into Thursday, residents across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighborhoods amid reports of robberies. Communities used loudspeakers in mosques to alert people that robberies were occurring, and police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for people seeking help.\n\nThe quick move to select Yunus came when Hasina's resignation created a power vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule, messy politics and myriad crises.\n\nMany fear that Hasina's departure could trigger even more instability in the densely populated nation of some 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.\n\nHasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, in an election boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the vote, and the U.S. and U.K. denounced the result as not credible.", "source": {"uri": "mb.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila

He received a bouquet of flowers from supporters.\n\nHe was sworn in as head of the country's interim government shortly after his return on Thursday. His oath was administered by President Mohammed Shahabuddin, declaring Yunus his chief adviser. The position is said to be equivalent to that of prime minister.\n\n\"Today is a glorious day for us,\" Yunus told a news conference at the airport. \"Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence,\" said Yunus, who was appointed by the military.\n\nA crowd gathers in front of the president's official residence during the oath-taking ceremony of the interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Aug. 8, 2024.\n\nThe unrest that led to Sheikh Hasina's departure began with protests against a government job quota system and expanded into broader opposition to her long tenure, marked by allegations of human rights abuses and election rigging.\n\nMore than 300 people died in the initial weeks of the protests.\n\nGeneral Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a televised address Wednesday that those responsible for recent violence will be held accountable.\n\nYunus is tasked with restoring peace. At a news briefing, Yunus said he will focus on reestablishing order, asking for all violence to end.\n\n'Violence is our enemy. Please don't create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country,' Yunus said.\n\nShahabuddin, who is currently a ceremonial leader, dissolved parliament on Tuesday. This move has paved the way for Yunus to lead the interim government, although the timing of new elections remains uncertain.\n\nYunus is an economist and banker who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his work with microcredit through Grameen Bank. He has been recognized for his efforts in reducing poverty through small loans.\n\nYunus was acquitted on Wednesday in a case regarding labor law violations where he was sentenced to jail for six months. The case involved a telecommunications company he founded\n\nIn his first statement since being appointed, Yunus praised the students for their role in recent protests and urged calm. He stressed the need to avoid further violence and focus on rebuilding the country.\n\nAs the country shifted to the interim government, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or BNP, held a rally in Dhaka. The rally was led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who was recently released from house arrest.\n\nZia, who served as prime minister from 2001 to 2006, was convicted of corruption in 2018 and sentenced to 17 years in prison. Her party claims the charges were politically motivated.\n\nSupporters gathered for the BNP rally in Dhaka's Naya Paltan area hours before it began, reflecting the evolving political situation.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Hasina, 76, was reelected for a fourth term in January, but the election faced criticism as flawed. The United States and United Kingdom condemned the results.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dhaka was relatively calm following recent violence. Student volunteers were seen cleaning streets and managing traffic, and the police presence was minimal.\n\nSome information for this report was provided by Agence France-Presse, The Associated Press and Reuters.\n\nThe Voice of America provides news and information in more than 40 languages to an estimated weekly audience of over 326 million people.

But she resigned and fled to India on Monday after the protests coalesced into a movement against her government and more than 300 people including students and police officers were killed in the spiraling violence.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his best wishes to Yunus in a statement on social media platform X, and alluded to reports that Hindus in Muslim-majority Bangladesh had been targeted during the violence.\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" Modi said. \"India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.\"\n\nYunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in Paris for the Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role. He called for calm and an end to partisan violence before he returned home earlier Thursday.\n\nIn his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. \"Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,\" Yunus said, flanked by student leaders. \"It has immense possibility.\"\n\nYunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a \"bloodsucker\" allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.\n\nOn Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.\n\nThe president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration.\n\nThe quick move to select Yunus came when Hasina's resignation created a vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule and myriad crises.\n\nMany fear that Hasina's departure could trigger even more instability in the nation of some 170 million people, already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.\n\nHasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, has vowed that his family and the Awami League party would remain engaged in Bangladesh's politics despite what he said have been attacks on the Awami League party over the past week. Many observers see Joy as Hasina's successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nation's politics.\n\n\"If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League,\" he said. \"The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh.\"\n\nHasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, but the vote was boycotted by her main opponents, thousands of opposition members were jailed beforehand, and the U.S. and U.K. denounced the result as not credible. Hasina's critics say her administration increasingly was marked by human rights abuses and corruption.\n\nThe chaos on Bangladesh's streets continued after her resignation on Monday. Dozens of police officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured.\n\nOvernight into Thursday, residents across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighborhoods amid reports of robberies. Communities used loudspeakers in mosques to alert people that robberies were occurring, and police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for people seeking help.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

"title": "Bangladesh's Yunus tackles 'law and order' as interim govt begins work", "body": "Life is seemingly returning to normal in Bangladesh with schools reopening\n\nNobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and his newly named interim government set out Friday to restore \"law and order\" after a student-led uprising and deadly mass protests forced predecessor Sheikh Hasina into exile.\n\nA day after returning home from Europe and vowing to \"uphold, support and protect the constitution\" as he was sworn into office, 84-year-old Yunus began the tough challenge of returning the country to democracy.\n\n\"The number one challenge is the law and order,\" Touhid Hossain, who has taken over the foreign ministry portfolio, told reporters. \"If it is ensured, the rest will be fine.\"\n\nHasina, 76, accused of widespread human rights abuses including the jailing of her political opponents, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her 15-year rule.\n\nThe military announced her resignation and then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.\n\nYunus, who has taken the title of \"chief advisor\" to the caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, has said he wants to hold elections \"within a few months\".\n\nWhen polls might take place is not clear.\n\nOfficials of Hasina's former ruling party, the Awami League, have gone into hiding after revenge attacks saw some of their offices torched, while former opposition groups such as the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are rebuilding after years of crushing repression.\n\nSeveral of Yunus' advisers are loosely affiliated with the BNP, led by Hasina's longtime rival and former premier Khaleda Zia, 78, newly released after years of house arrest.\n\n- 'Forge reconciliation' -\n\nYunus wrote in The Economist this week that his country needed a new generation of leaders \"who are not obsessed with settling scores, as too many of our previous governments were\".\n\nFor Syeda Rizwana Hasan, a top environmental activist and lawyer appointed to oversee climate change affairs, the transition offers a chance to change the country's political course.\n\n\"My plan is to lay the foundation to put Bangladesh on a truly liberal democratic path,\" she said.\n\nThat desire for change was echoed by former student leader Nahid Islam, now information adviser in the cabinet.\n\n\"This government has been made through a mass uprising, and people have that trust,\" 26-year-old Islam said.\n\n\"Our goal is to reconstruct the Bangladesh that we dreamt in the fastest possible time.\"\n\nMore from this section Nearly 40,000 and counting: the struggle to keep track of Gaza deaths NCAA asked to keep men out of women's sports Search called off for missing Germans in French Alps\n\nBut the new administration faces a daunting task.\n\nYunus has called for the restoration of order in the South Asian nation after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\nUN country chief Gwyn Lewis on Friday praised Yunus' \"calls for calm and peace\", adding she would \"work with all parties to forge reconciliation\".\n\n- 'Victory day' -\n\nHasina's flight abroad has heightened rancour towards India, which played a decisive military role in securing Bangladesh's independence, but also backed Hasina to the hilt.\n\nHer son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told the Times of India newspaper his mother still had hope of contesting political office.\n\n\"She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election,\" he said.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to offer his \"best wishes\" to Yunus on Thursday moments after he was sworn in, saying New Delhi was \"committed\" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.\n\nIndia's arch-rival Pakistan on Friday also said it hoped it could boost ties with Dhaka, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wishing Yunus \"great success in guiding Bangladesh towards a harmonious and prosperous future\".\n\nChina said Friday it also welcomed the interim government, promising to work with the country \"to promote exchange and cooperation\".\n\nIn driving rain, Yunus carried out his first duty as leader, standing silently alongside student and civil society leaders.\n\nTogether the group laid a wreath in the red-and-green colours of the national flag at the main memorial commemorating the millions who died in Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.\n\nYunus suggested on his arrival in Dhaka on Thursday that Hasina's ouster was as significant as the conflict that brought Bangladesh into being.\n\n\"Bangladesh has created a new victory day,\" he told reporters. \"Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"\n\nsa-gle/pjm/tym", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"},

We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation,\" he said.\n\n\"My call to the people is if you have trust in me, then make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country.\"\n\n\"Every person is our brother ... our task is to protect them,\" he said, adding that \"the whole of Bangladesh is one big family\".\n\nYunus choked with emotion as he recalled the killing of student activist Abu Sayeed, shot dead in July by police from close range.\n\nHe paid tribute to the youth who sparked the protest movement and those who risked all for their desire for change. \"They protected the nation and gave it a new life\", he said.\n\nYunus will be the chief adviser in the interim government tasked with holding fresh elections in the South Asian country of 170 million people.\n\nThe student-led movement that ousted Hasina grew out of protests against quotas in government jobs that spiralled in July, provoking a violent crackdown that drew global criticism, although the government denied using excessive force.\n\nThe protests were fuelled also by harsh economic conditions and political repression in the country.\n\nYunus will head a caretaker government that is being established by the military, which turned on Hasina over the weekend after hundreds of people were killed in the unrest.\n\nThe prospect of Yunus standing alongside military leaders was almost unimaginable a week ago when security forces fired deadly rounds at protesters who took to the streets demanding that Hasina resign.\n\nBut the military turned on Hasina at the weekend and she was forced to flee to neighbouring India -- as millions of Bangladeshis celebrated her demise.\n\nThe military then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.\n\nHasina's Awami League party does not figure in the interim government after she resigned on Monday, following weeks of violence that killed more than 400 people and injured thousands.\n\nIn a Facebook post, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said the party had not given up, however, and was ready to hold talks with opponents and the interim government.\n\n\"I had said my family will no longer be involved in politics but the way our party leaders and workers are being attacked, we cannot give up,\" he said on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his \"best wishes\" to Yunus, saying New Delhi was \"committed\" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.\n\n\"My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities,\" Modi wrote on social media platform X.\n\n\"India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfil the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.\"\n\nDuring Hasina's reign, Yunus was hit with more than 100 criminal cases and a smear campaign by a state-led religious agency that accused him of promoting homosexuality.\n\nYunus had travelled abroad this year while on bail after being sentenced to six months in jail on a charge condemned as politically motivated, and which a Dhaka court on Wednesday acquitted him of.\n\nArmy chief General Wakeruz Zaman said on Wednesday he supported Yunus.\n\n\"I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process,\" Zaman said.\n\nFew other details about the planned government have been released, including the role of the military.\n\nBut Bangladeshis voiced hope as they joined a rally in Dhaka on Wednesday for the former opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP).\n\n\"I expect that a national government will be formed with everyone's consent in a beautiful way,\" Moynul Islam Pintu told AFP.\n\n\"I expect that the country is run in a nice way, and the police force is reformed so that they can't harass people.\"\n\nHasina, 76, who had been in power since 2009, quit on Monday as hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets of Dhaka. Jubilant crowds later stormed and looted her palace.\n\nMonday's events were the culmination of more than a month of unrest, which began as protests against a plan for quotas in government jobs but morphed into an anti-Hasina movement.\n\nHasina, who was accused of rigging the January elections and widespread human rights abuses, deployed security forces to quash the protests.\n\nAt least 455 people were killed in the unrest, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and hospital doctors.\n\n\"The protests are a seismic moment in Bangladesh's history,\" said International Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean.\n\n\"The country really had been at risk of becoming a one-party state, and through a peaceful street-based movement led by, Gen Z students in their 20s, they've managed to force her from power.\"\n\nMilitary move\n\nThe military's switching of allegiance was the decisive factor in her demise.\n\nIt has since acceded to a range of other demands from the student leaders. The president dissolved parliament on Tuesday, a key demand of the students and the BNP.\n\nThe head of the police force, which protesters have blamed for leading Hasina's crackdown, was sacked on Tuesday.\n\nThe new chief, Mainul Islam, offered an apology on Wednesday for the conduct of officers and vowed a \"fair and impartial investigation\" into the killings of \"students, common people and the police\".\n\nEx-prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, 78, was also released from years of house arrest, while some political prisoners were freed.\n\nThe military has demoted some generals seen as close to Hasina and sacked Ziaul Ahsan, a commander of the feared Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force.\n\nPolice said mobs had launched revenge attacks on officers and Hasina's allies, and also freed more than 500 inmates from a prison.\n\nProtesters broke into parliament and torched TV stations. Others smashed statues of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence hero.\n\nSince Tuesday, however, streets in the capital have been largely peaceful.__Courtesy dawn.com",

"title": "Bangladesh's Yunus tackles 'law and order' as interim govt begins work", "body": "Life is seemingly returning to normal in Bangladesh with schools reopening\n\nNobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and his newly named interim government set out Friday to restore \"law and order\" after a student-led uprising and deadly mass protests forced predecessor Sheikh Hasina into exile.\n\nA day after returning home from Europe and vowing to \"uphold, support and protect the constitution\" as he was sworn into office, 84-year-old Yunus began the tough challenge of returning the country to democracy.\n\n\"The number one challenge is the law and order,\" Touhid Hossain, who has taken over the foreign ministry portfolio, told reporters. \"If it is ensured, the rest will be fine.\"\n\nHasina, 76, accused of widespread human rights abuses including the jailing of her political opponents, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her 15-year rule.\n\nThe military announced her resignation and then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.\n\nYunus, who has taken the title of \"chief advisor\" to the caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, has said he wants to hold elections \"within a few months\".\n\nWhen polls might take place is not clear.\n\nOfficials of Hasina's former ruling party, the Awami League, have gone into hiding after revenge attacks saw some of their offices torched, while former opposition groups such as the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are rebuilding after years of crushing repression.\n\nSeveral of Yunus' advisers are loosely affiliated with the BNP, led by Hasina's longtime rival and former premier Khaleda Zia, 78, newly released after years of house arrest.\n\n- 'Forge reconciliation' -\n\nYunus wrote in The Economist this week that his country needed a new generation of leaders \"who are not obsessed with settling scores, as too many of our previous governments were\".\n\nFor Syeda Rizwana Hasan, a top environmental activist and lawyer appointed to oversee climate change affairs, the transition offers a chance to change the country's political course.\n\n\"My plan is to lay the foundation to put Bangladesh on a truly liberal democratic path,\" she said.\n\nThat desire for change was echoed by former student leader Nahid Islam, now information adviser in the cabinet.\n\n\"This government has been made through a mass uprising, and people have that trust,\" 26-year-old Islam said.\n\n\"Our goal is to reconstruct the Bangladesh that we dreamt in the fastest possible time.\"\n\nBut the new administration faces a daunting task.\n\nYunus has called for the restoration of order in the South Asian nation after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\nUN country chief Gwyn Lewis on Friday praised Yunus' \"calls for calm and peace\", adding she would \"work with all parties to forge reconciliation\".\n\n- 'Victory day' -\n\nHasina's flight abroad has heightened rancour towards India, which played a decisive military role in securing Bangladesh's independence, but also backed Hasina to the hilt.\n\nHer son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told the Times of India newspaper his mother still had hope of contesting political office.\n\n\"She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election,\" he said.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to offer his \"best wishes\" to Yunus on Thursday moments after he was sworn in, saying New Delhi was \"committed\" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.\n\nIndia's arch-rival Pakistan on Friday also said it hoped it could boost ties with Dhaka, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wishing Yunus \"great success in guiding Bangladesh towards a harmonious and prosperous future\".\n\nChina said Friday it also welcomed the interim government, promising to work with the country \"to promote exchange and cooperation\".\n\nIn driving rain, Yunus carried out his first duty as leader, standing silently alongside student and civil society leaders.\n\nTogether the group laid a wreath in the red-and-green colours of the national flag at the main memorial commemorating the millions who died in Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.\n\nYunus suggested on his arrival in Dhaka on Thursday that Hasina's ouster was as significant as the conflict that brought Bangladesh into being.\n\n\"Bangladesh has created a new victory day,\" he told reporters. \"Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"\n\nsa-gle/pjm/tym\n\nMore from this section\n\nNPA Announces New Cohort of IMPACT Fellows: Six remarkable postdocs

heroes as interim government begins work", "body": "Dhaka (AFP) - Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus led a solemn tribute to Bangladesh's fallen independence heroes in the first act of his interim government on Friday, after a student-led uprising forced predecessor Sheikh Hasina into exile.\n\nA day after returning home from Europe and vowing to \"uphold, support and protect the constitution\" as he was sworn into office, 84-year-old Yunus began the tough challenge of returning the country to democracy.\n\nHasina, 76, accused of widespread human rights abuses including the jailing of her political opponents, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her 15-year rule.\n\nThe military announced her resignation then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.\n\nYunus, who has taken the title of \"chief advisor\" to a caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, has said he wants to hold elections \"within a few months\".\n\nWhen polls might take place is not clear.\n\nOfficials of Hasina's former ruling party, the Awami League, have gone into hiding after revenge attacks saw some of their offices torched, while former opposition groups such as the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are rebuilding after years of crushing repression.\n\nThe veteran economist has called for the restoration of order in the South Asian nation after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\nIn driving rain, Yunus stood silently on Friday alongside student and civil society leaders in the new \"advisory\" cabinet tasked with steering democratic reforms.\n\nTogether the group laid a wreath in the red-and-green colours of the national flag at the main memorial commemorating the millions who died in Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.\n\nYunus suggested on his arrival on Thursday in Dhaka that Hasina's ouster was as significant as the conflict that brought Bangladesh into being.\n\n\"Bangladesh has created a new victory day,\" he told reporters. \"Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"\n\nSeveral of Yunus' advisers are loosely affiliated with the BNP, led by Hasina's longtime rival and former premier Khaleda Zia, 78, newly released from years of house arrest.\n\nThey also include student leaders who started the protests.\n\nYunus wrote in The Economist this week that his country needed a new generation of leaders \"who are not obsessed with settling scores, as too many of our previous governments were\".\n\nHowever, Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told the Times of India newspaper his mother still had hope of contesting political office.\n\n\"She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election,\" he said.\n\n'Law and order'\n\nHasina's flight abroad has heightened rancour towards India, which played a decisive military role in securing Bangladesh's independence, but also backed Hasina to the hilt.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to offer his \"best wishes\" to Yunus on Thursday moments after he was sworn in, saying New Delhi was \"committed\" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.\n\nIndia's arch-rival Pakistan on Friday also said it hoped it could boost ties with Dhaka, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wishing Yunus \"great success in guiding Bangladesh towards a harmonious and prosperous future\".\n\nChina said Friday it also welcomed the interim government, promising to work with the country \"to promote exchange and cooperation\".\n\nFarida Akhter, an adviser to the interim government, told AFP that the group would also visit a monument in Dhaka where the student protests started last month.\n\n\"We are paying our respects there, as the student movement began from there,\" she said, before naming the top task on their to-do list.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"},

He received a bouquet of flowers from supporters.\n\nHe was sworn in as head of the country's interim government shortly after his return on Thursday. His oath was administered by President Mohammed Shahabuddin, declaring Yunus his chief adviser. The position is said to be equivalent to that of prime minister.\n\n\"Today is a glorious day for us,\" Yunus told a news conference at the airport. \"Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence,\" said Yunus, who was appointed by the military.\n\nThe unrest that led to Sheikh Hasina's departure began with protests against a government job quota system and expanded into broader opposition to her long tenure, marked by allegations of human rights abuses and election rigging.\n\nMore than 300 people died in the initial weeks of the protests.\n\nGeneral Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a televised address Wednesday that those responsible for recent violence will be held accountable.\n\nYunus is tasked with restoring peace. At a news briefing, Yunus said he will focus on reestablishing order, asking for all violence to end.\n\n\"Violence is our enemy. Please don't create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country,\" Yunus said.\n\nShahabuddin, who is currently a ceremonial leader, dissolved parliament on Tuesday. This move has paved the way for Yunus to lead the interim government, although the timing of new elections remains uncertain.\n\nYunus is an economist and banker who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his work with microcredit through Grameen Bank. He has been recognized for his efforts in reducing poverty through small loans.\n\nYunus was acquitted on Wednesday in a case regarding labor law violations where he was sentenced to jail for six months. The case involved a telecommunications company he founded\n\nIn his first statement since being appointed, Yunus praised the students for their role in recent protests and urged calm. He stressed the need to avoid further violence and focus on rebuilding the country.\n\nAs the country shifted to the interim government, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or BNP, held a rally in Dhaka. The rally was led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who was recently released from house arrest.\n\nZia, who served as prime minister from 2001 to 2006, was convicted of corruption in 2018 and sentenced to 17 years in prison. Her party claims the charges were politically motivated.\n\nSupporters gathered for the BNP rally in Dhaka's Naya Paltan area hours before it began, reflecting the evolving political situation.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Hasina, 76, was reelected for a fourth term in January, but the election faced criticism as flawed. The United States and United Kingdom condemned the results.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dhaka was relatively calm following recent violence. Student volunteers were seen cleaning streets and managing traffic, and the police presence was minimal.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_pike@globalsecurity.org", "name": "John Pike", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazrat_Shahjalal_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dissolution of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microcredit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grameen Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "House arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801989", "eventUri": "eng-9801989", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Yunus, who earlier yesterday had hailed the overthrow of Hasina as Bangladesh's \"second independence\", swore to \"uphold, support and protect the constitution\", in front of political and civil society leaders, generals and diplomats at the presidential palace.\n\n\"Today is a glorious day for us,\" Yunus, 84, told reporters hours earlier when he returned to Dhaka from Europe. \"Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence.\" Yunus called for the restoration of order after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack. \"Law and order is our first task... We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation,\" he said.\n\n\"My call to the people is if you have trust in me, then make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country.\" \"Every person is our brother... our task is to protect them,\" Yunus said, adding that \"the whole of Bangladesh is one big family\". More than a dozen members of his cabinet, who are titled advisers, not ministers, also took the oath. They included top leaders of the Students Against Discrimination group that led the weekslong protests, Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud.\n\nOthers included a former foreign secretary and a former attorney general, an environmental lawyer, and prominent rights activist Adilur Rahman Khan who was sentenced to two years in jail during Hasina's rule. Hasina, accused of widespread human rights abuses including jailing of political opponents, was forced to flee to neighbouring India on Monday as masses of protesters flooded Dhaka's streets.\n\nThe military then agreed to student demands that Yunus who won the Nobel in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work lead an interim government. Yunus choked with emotion on Thursday as he recalled the killing of student activist Abu Sayeed, shot dead in July by police from close range.\n\nHe paid tribute to the youth who sparked the protest movement and those who risked all for their desire for change. \"They protected the nation and gave it a new life\", he said. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his \"best wishes\" to Yunus on Thursday, saying New Delhi was \"committed\" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.\n\nYunus had travelled abroad this year while on bail after being sentenced to six months in jail on a charge condemned as politically motivated, and which a Dhaka court on Wednesday acquitted him of.

The country has witnessed violence and clashes even after the student-led protests forced Ms Hasina to resign and flee the country on Monday.\n\nMr Yunus, 84, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering microcredit and microfinance, which he put into action through the Grameen Bank. He was sworn in hours after he returned to Dhaka from Paris, where he had been undergoing medical treatment.

The advisers include Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, two key leaders of the protests that led to Ms Hasina's ouster.\n\nAmong the other members of the council are Adilur Rahman Khan, a prominent rights activist who was sentenced to a two-year jail term under Ms Hasina; women's rights activist Farida Akhtar; Grameen Telecom trustee Nurjahan Begum; former foreign secretary Touhid Hossain; and AFM Khalid Hossain, deputy chief of right-wing party Hefazat-e-Islam.\n\nSpeaking before the swearing-in ceremony, Mr Yunus said, \"Today is a glorious day for us... Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"\n\nUrging a return to normalcy, he added, \"We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation. My call to the people is that if you have trust in me, make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country... We are one big family.\"\n\nViolent Protests\n\nTrouble had been brewing in Bangladesh since before the January 7 elections, which was won by Sheikh Hasina's Awami League in a landslide, but the electoral exercise was widely seen as being far from free and fair.\n\nA fresh wave of protests led by students began in June - in which over 450 people have been killed so far - after a Bangladeshi high court reinstated 30 per cent reservation in government jobs for family members of freedom fighters and veterans from Bangladesh's 1971 War of Independence. The quota was later scaled back by the country's Supreme Court but Ms Hasina's handling of the protests and her alleged use of an offensive label for the protesters infuriated students.\n\nProtests continued with students demanding that Ms Hasina step down and clashes between agitators and the police left over 100 dead and dozens injured across the country on Sunday.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nMonday saw lakhs of students flooding the streets and heading towards the prime minister's official residence, Ganabhaban, forcing Ms Hasina to resign and flee to India. Violence continued in some places even after Ms Hasina resigned and there have been reports of minorities, including Hindus, being targeted.\n\n(With agency inputs)", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com",

At 84, Yunus praised the student-led protests that had led to Hasina's fall, calling it a 'Second Victory Day'. He has been critical of Hasina's strict rule over the past 15 years. He now takes charge after one of the deadliest protests in the nation's history, which resulted in over 300 deaths and thousands of arrests.\n\nThe protests had begun over a job quota system that reserved more than half of the jobs for specific groups, including one-third for the descendants of Bangladesh's 1971 War of Independence veterans. Although the Supreme Court reduced the quotas on July 21, it did not satisfy the protesters. \"This is our beautiful country with many exciting possibilities. We must protect it and make it wonderful for ourselves and for future generations,\" Yunus told reporters.\n\nThe recent protests, which started over government job quotas, grew into a larger movement driven by the youth, who make up a third of the population. They are calling for a new type of politics that emphasises greater democracy and accountability.\n\nYunus faces significant challenges, including restoring law and order, reviving the economy and ensuring free and fair elections. Ahmed Ahsan, a former World Bank economist and director of the Policy Research Institute in Bangladesh, said Yunus was \"the man of the hour\", firmly backed by students protesters who led the movement,\" according to Al-Jazeera.\n\nChampioning Cause of the Poor\n\nYunus, the third among nine children of his parents, was born in a village near Chittagong, in erstwhile East Pakistan, in 1940. The year 1961 saw him graduating from the University of Dhaka and travelling to the US on a Fulbright scholarship in 1965 to do his Ph.D in economics at Vanderbilt University, finishing in 1969. After that, he became an assistant professor at Middle Tennessee State University.\n\nDuring Bangladesh's 1971 Liberation War, Yunus supported the movement for Bangladesh's independence. He helped create a citizens' committee in Nashville and worked with the Bangladesh Information Center in Washington, DC, to lobby Congress to stop military aid to Pakistan. In 1972, after Bangladesh gained independence, Yunus returned home. He worked at Bangladesh's new Planning Commission for a short while before he joined the University of Chittagong's economics department.\n\nIn 1976, while conducting field research, he visited villages affected by famine. He loaned $27 to 42 villagers and they all repaid him on time. This experience showed him that small loans, or microcredit, could significantly help poor villagers, who were often trapped by high-interest moneylenders. It led to the creation of Grameen Bank, which focused on providing microcredit to help people start businesses. Yunus became known as the 'Banker to the Poor' for helping millions escape poverty through this initiative.\n\nRecipient of the 2006 Nobel Prize\n\nIn 2006, the Nobel Peace Prize went to Yunus and Grameen Bank for their efforts to promote economic growth and social equity at the grassroots level. By then, the bank had lent over $7 billion to more than seven million borrowers, 97% of whom were women, with an impressive repayment rate of nearly 100%.\n\nYunus is now navigating the challenging world of politics, moving beyond just theory. His immediate task at hand is to restore stability after five weeks of violent protests. But he faces a bigger problem: an economic crisis with rising food prices and a stagnant job market.\n\nJon Danilowicz, a former US diplomat who worked in Bangladesh for eight years, believes Yunus is a strong choice for leadership because of his international reputation, which could benefit the 170 million people in the country. Danilowicz noted that Yunus had significant credibility, especially in the US and could leverage the goodwill there to help Bangladesh.\n\nHe also outlined three major challenges for the interim government:\n\nAddressing economic issues\n\nUntangling political influences in such key institutions as the civil service, police and judiciary, and\n\nHolding serious human rights violators accountable\n\nHe needs to quickly establish civilian leadership and ensure that the army returns to its usual role of supporting the government, Danilowicz said. On the diplomatic side, Yunus will need to build a friendly relationship with India, which has supported the Hasina administration. Hasina is currently visiting India.\n\nTargeted by former PM Hasina\n\nYunus became a target of Hasina's anger after he suggested starting a political party in 2007. His idea for a party came because the two main political parties -- Hasina's Awami League and the Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) -- were failing to tackle widespread corruption and growing income inequality.\n\nIn 2011, Hasina, seeing the respected economist as a political threat, removed him from his role as managing director of Grameen Bank, calling him a \"bloodsucker\" of the poor. Her government then launched financial investigations into his non-profit organizations. Last year, Yunus was convicted of violating labour laws and faces an ongoing corruption case that many believe is unfounded.\n\nYunus has faced ongoing persecution from the previous government, but he never thought of leaving the country. Instead, he has chosen to support his own institution and his nation, thus opting to be a patriot.\n\nDisappointed with India's Response\n\nIn an interview with the Indian Express, Yunus expressed his disappointment with India's view that the protests in Bangladesh were an internal matter. He questioned how a fire in a neighbour's house could be called an \"internal matter\". He added, \"We want to have friendly relations with all neighbouring countries. We want to feel like a family and enjoy each other's company, just like the European Union. When India labels it 'an internal issue', it hurts me.\"\n\n(The author of this article is a Defence, Aerospace & Political Analyst based in Bengaluru.

He, however, did not disclose their names and the possible tenure of the government.\n\nThe Army chief hoped that normalcy would return within three to four days as the situation across the country is improving significantly.\n\nYunus, whose name was first proposed for the top job by the coordinators of the student movement that led to Hasina's ouster, on Wednesday congratulated the \"brave students\" who took the lead in making, what he said, \"our Second Victory Day possible\", and appealed to all students, political parties and non-political people to stay calm.\n\n\"Let us not miss the chance by going into any senseless violence. Violence is our enemy. Please don't create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country,\" he said in a statement. \"If we take the path of violence everything will be destroyed. Please stay calm. Help those around you to stay calm.\" His successful anti-poverty campaign through the Grameen Bank became a model which was replicated across continents.\n\nHe had been in a protracted row with Hasina's government due to obscure reasons while authorities initiated a series of investigations against him after she came to power in 2008.\n\nAlso read | 'Hurts when India calls protests internal affair of Bangladesh': Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus\n\nBangladesh authorities launched a review of the statutory Grameen Bank's activities in 2011 and fired Yunus as its founding managing director on charges of violating the government retirement regulation.\n\nYunus was charged under dozens of cases during Hasina's regime. In January, a court sentenced Yunus to six months in jail on charges of labour law violation.\n\nMany people believe Hasina became enraged when Yunus announced that he would form a political party in 2007 when a military-backed government ran the country and Hasina was in prison.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazrat_Shahjalal_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dissolution of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microcredit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangabhaban", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangabhaban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oath of office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_residence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official residence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_Day_(9_May)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victory Day (9 May)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grameen Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/Yunus.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801989", "eventUri": "eng-9801989", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

begins work | FOX 28 Spokane", "body": "Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus led a solemn tribute to Bangladesh's fallen independence heroes in the first act of his interim government on Friday, after a student-led uprising forced predecessor Sheikh Hasina into exile.\n\nA day after returning home from Europe and vowing to \"uphold, support and protect the constitution\" as he was sworn into office, 84-year-old Yunus began the tough challenge of returning the country to democracy.\n\nHasina, 76, accused of widespread human rights abuses including the jailing of her political opponents, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her 15-year rule.\n\nThe military announced her resignation then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.\n\nYunus, who has taken the title of \"chief advisor\" to a caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, has said he wants to hold elections \"within a few months\".\n\nWhen polls might take place is not clear.\n\nOfficials of Hasina's former ruling party, the Awami League, have gone into hiding after revenge attacks saw some of their offices torched, while former opposition groups such as the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are rebuilding after years of crushing repression.\n\n- 'Victory day' -\n\nThe new administration faces a daunting task.\n\nThe veteran economist has called for the restoration of order in the South Asian nation after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\nIn driving rain, Yunus stood silently on Friday alongside student and civil society leaders in the new \"advisory\" cabinet tasked with steering democratic reforms.\n\nTogether the group laid a wreath in the red-and-green colours of the national flag at the main memorial commemorating the millions who died in Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.\n\nYunus suggested on his arrival on Thursday in Dhaka that Hasina's ouster was as significant as the conflict that brought Bangladesh into being.\n\n\"Bangladesh has created a new victory day,\" he told reporters. \"Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"\n\nSeveral of Yunus' advisers are loosely affiliated with the BNP, led by Hasina's longtime rival and former premier Khaleda Zia, 78, newly released from years of house arrest.\n\nThey also include student leaders who started the protests.\n\nYunus wrote in The Economist this week that his country needed a new generation of leaders \"who are not obsessed with settling scores, as too many of our previous governments were\".\n\nHowever, Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told the Times of India newspaper his mother still had hope of contesting political office.\n\n\"She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election,\" he said.\n\n- 'Law and order' -\n\nHasina's flight abroad has heightened rancour towards India, which played a decisive military role in securing Bangladesh's independence, but also backed Hasina to the hilt.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to offer his \"best wishes\" to Yunus on Thursday moments after he was sworn in, saying New Delhi was \"committed\" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.\n\nIndia's arch-rival Pakistan on Friday also said it hoped it could boost ties with Dhaka, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wishing Yunus \"great success in guiding Bangladesh towards a harmonious and prosperous future\".\n\nChina said Friday it also welcomed the interim government, promising to work with the country \"to promote exchange and cooperation\".\n\nFarida Akhter, an adviser to the interim government, told AFP that the group would also visit a monument in Dhaka where the student protests started last month.\n\n\"We are paying our respects there, as the student movement began from there,\" she said, before naming the top task on their to-do list.\n\n\"Our first priority is law and order\", she said.\n\nsa-gle/pjm/fox\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"}, "authors": [{"uri":

AFP\n\nNobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus was sworn into office on Thursday (August 8) to lead Bangladesh's interim government as its chief adviser. This came days after a student-led uprising ended the 15-year rule of Sheikh Hasina.\n\nYunus took the oath at the presidential palace in the capital, Dhaka, in front of political leaders, civil society leaders, generals, and diplomats.\n\nMore than a dozen members of his cabinet, who are titled advisers and not ministers, also took the oath.\n\nHere's how India, China, and the world reacted to the interim government formation in Bangladesh:\n\nIndia\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi took to social media platform X to write, \"My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities.\"\n\nHe reiterated India's dedication to its partnership with Bangladesh, saying, \"India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfil the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.\"\n\nModi also addressed concerns about minority communities in Bangladesh, particularly Hindus, who have faced attacks on their properties following Hasina's departure.\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" Modi said.\n\nChina\n\nChina welcomed the formation of Bangladesh's interim government while reaffirming its principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations.\n\n\"China has noted the establishment of an interim government of Bangladesh and welcomes this,\" a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry stated on Friday (August 9). The spokesperson stressed Beijing's respect for \"the development path independently chosen by the Bangladeshi people.\"\n\nChina signalled its intent to maintain and strengthen its ties with Bangladesh. \"China attaches importance to the development of China-Bangladesh relations,\" the foreign ministry spokesperson added.\n\nUnited States\n\nThe United States also welcomed the new government under Yunus, expressing hopes for a peaceful and democratic transition in Bangladesh. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller conveyed Washington's readiness to support the interim administration.\n\n\"We welcome Dr. Yunus's call for an end to the recent violence and we stand ready to work with the interim government and Dr. Yunus as it charts a democratic future for the people of Bangladesh,\" Miller said during a press briefing on Thursday.\n\nThe US has had a complex relationship with Sheikh Hasina, whose tenure was marked by increasing tension with Washington over her government's democratic record.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nThe European Union joined the chorus of international responses, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell offering a positive outlook on the new interim government.\n\n\"The EU looks forward to engaging with the new administration and to supporting this critical transition which should be part of a peaceful and inclusive process underpinned by good governance, democratic values and respect for human rights,\" Borrell said in a

The Grameen Bank he founded won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for helping lift millions from poverty by providing tiny loans to the rural poor who are too impoverished to gain attention from traditional banks.\n\nAs chief adviser of the caretaker government, he is, however, tasked with bringing stability back to the country which witnessed some of its worst violence in decades and then hold fresh parliamentary elections.\n\n\"The brutal, autocratic regime is gone,\" Yunus said in a televised address to the nation after taking charge. \"Tomorrow, with the rising sun, democracy, justice, human rights, and full freedom of fearless expression will be enjoyed by all, regardless of party affiliation. That is our goal.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, on his arrival in Dhaka following medical treatment in Paris, Yunus said he would govern it with the guidance of students who backed him for the role in the caretaker government.\n\nA harsh critic of Hasina, Yunus became emotional and seemed to hold his tears back at the airport as he referred to a student he said had been shot during the protests and that sacrifice could not be forgotten.\n\nHasina's flight from the country she ruled for 20 of the last 30 years after winning a fourth term in January brought jubilation and violence as crowds stormed and ransacked her official residence.\n\nMany Hindu homes, temples and businesses were vandalized after Hasina's departure, and hundreds in the minority community have tried unsuccessfully to flee to India this week. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council said a schoolteacher was killed and 45 other people hurt.\n\nMany Hindus have traditionally supported Hasina's Awami League party, which identifies as secular.\n\nYunus's swearing-in plugged the power vacuum Hasina's resignation created in the South Asian country of 170 million people, which has the fourth-largest Muslim population in the world.\n\nPresident Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath of office to Yunus and 13 advisers who will help him govern, at a brief ceremony in the official presidential residence.\n\nThree more advisers will be sworn in at a later date, officials said. Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, two student leaders who are both in their mid-20s and led the protests, were among the 13 who joined the caretaker government.\n\nThe ceremony started with a minute's silence to honor the hundreds who were killed in the protests and clashes that erupted in July.\n\nHasina's Awami League party does not figure in the interim government. In a Facebook post, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said the party had not given up, and was ready to hold talks with opponents and the interim government.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) boycotted two national elections after the arrest of its leaders and has demanded fresh elections in three months.\n\nHasina is sheltering in the New Delhi area, a development that Yunus said caused anger at India among some Bangladeshis. India's foreign ministry said it had no update on Hasina's travel plans and that it was up to her to \"take things forward.\"\n\nThe neighbors have longstanding cultural and business ties and New Delhi played a key role in the 1971 war with Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Yunus and said New Delhi was committed to working with Dhaka to fulfill the \"shared aspirations\" of the people of both countries for \"peace, security and development.\"\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" he said.\n\nThe student-led movement that ousted Hasina grew out of protests against quotas in government jobs that spiraled in July, provoking a violent crackdown that drew global criticism, though the government denied using excessive force.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors":

He received a bouquet of flowers from supporters.\n\nHe was sworn in as head of the country's interim government shortly after his return on Thursday. His oath was administered by President Mohammed Shahabuddin, declaring Yunus his chief adviser. The position is said to be equivalent to that of prime minister.\n\n\"Today is a glorious day for us,\" Yunus told a news conference at the airport. \"Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence,\" said Yunus, who was appointed by the military.\n\nA crowd gathers in front of the president's official residence during the oath-taking ceremony of the interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Aug. 8, 2024.\n\nThe unrest that led to Sheikh Hasina's departure began with protests against a government job quota system and expanded into broader opposition to her long tenure, marked by allegations of human rights abuses and election rigging.\n\nMore than 300 people died in the initial weeks of the protests.\n\nGeneral Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a televised address Wednesday that those responsible for recent violence will be held accountable.\n\nYunus is tasked with restoring peace. At a news briefing, Yunus said he will focus on reestablishing order, asking for all violence to end.\n\n'Violence is our enemy. Please don't create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country,' Yunus said.\n\nShahabuddin, who is currently a ceremonial leader, dissolved parliament on Tuesday. This move has paved the way for Yunus to lead the interim government, although the timing of new elections remains uncertain.\n\nYunus is an economist and banker who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his work with microcredit through Grameen Bank. He has been recognized for his efforts in reducing poverty through small loans.\n\nYunus was acquitted on Wednesday in a case regarding labor law violations where he was sentenced to jail for six months. The case involved a telecommunications company he founded\n\nIn his first statement since being appointed, Yunus praised the students for their role in recent protests and urged calm. He stressed the need to avoid further violence and focus on rebuilding the country.\n\nAs the country shifted to the interim government, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or BNP, held a rally in Dhaka. The rally was led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who was recently released from house arrest.\n\nZia, who served as prime minister from 2001 to 2006, was convicted of corruption in 2018 and sentenced to 17 years in prison. Her party claims the charges were politically motivated.\n\nSupporters gathered for the BNP rally in Dhaka's Naya Paltan area hours before it began, reflecting the evolving political situation.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Hasina, 76, was reelected for a fourth term in January, but the election faced criticism as flawed. The United States and United Kingdom condemned the results.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dhaka was relatively calm following recent violence. Student volunteers were seen cleaning streets and managing traffic, and the police presence was minimal.\n\nSome information for this report was provided by Agence France-Presse, The Associated Press

of his interim government on Friday, after a student-led uprising forced predecessor Sheikh Hasina into exile.\n\nA day after returning home from Europe and vowing to \"uphold, support and protect the constitution\" as he was sworn into office, 84-year-old Yunus began the tough challenge of returning the country to democracy.\n\nHasina, 76, accused of widespread human rights abuses including the jailing of her political opponents, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Monday as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her 15-year rule.\n\nThe military announced her resignation then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.\n\nYunus, who has taken the title of \"chief advisor\" to a caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, has said he wants to hold elections \"within a few months\".\n\nWhen polls might take place is not clear.\n\nOfficials of Hasina's former ruling party, the Awami League, have gone into hiding after revenge attacks saw some of their offices torched, while former opposition groups such as the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are rebuilding after years of crushing repression.\n\n- 'Victory day' -\n\nThe new administration faces a daunting task.\n\nThe veteran economist has called for the restoration of order in the South Asian nation after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\nIn driving rain, Yunus stood silently on Friday alongside student and civil society leaders in the new \"advisory\" cabinet tasked with steering democratic reforms.\n\nTogether the group laid a wreath in the red-and-green colours of the national flag at the main memorial commemorating the millions who died in Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.\n\nYunus suggested on his arrival on Thursday in Dhaka that Hasina's ouster was as significant as the conflict that brought Bangladesh into being.\n\n\"Bangladesh has created a new victory day,\" he told reporters. \"Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"\n\nMore from this section Eyeing a turnaround, Kelly Ortberg takes helm as Boeing CEO China's top chipmaker reports Q2 plunge in profits Milei slams 'progressive hypocrisy' as predecessor faces gender violence charge\n\nSeveral of Yunus' advisers are loosely affiliated with the BNP, led by Hasina's longtime rival and former premier Khaleda Zia, 78, newly released from years of house arrest.\n\nThey also include student leaders who started the protests.\n\nYunus wrote in The Economist this week that his country needed a new generation of leaders \"who are not obsessed with settling scores, as too many of our previous governments were\".\n\nHowever, Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy told the Times of India newspaper his mother still had hope of contesting political office.\n\n\"She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election,\" he said.\n\n- 'Law and order' -\n\nHasina's flight abroad has heightened rancour towards India, which played a decisive military role in securing Bangladesh's independence, but also backed Hasina to the hilt.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to offer his \"best wishes\" to Yunus on Thursday moments after he was sworn in, saying New Delhi was \"committed\" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.\n\nIndia's arch-rival Pakistan on Friday also said it hoped it could boost ties with Dhaka, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wishing Yunus \"great success in guiding Bangladesh towards a harmonious and prosperous future\".\n\nChina said Friday it also welcomed the interim government, promising to work with the country \"to promote exchange and cooperation\".\n\nFarida Akhter, an adviser to the interim government, told AFP that the group would also visit a monument in Dhaka where the student protests started last month.\n\n\"We are paying our respects there, as the student movement began from there,\" she said, before naming the top task on their to-do list.\n\n\"Our first priority is law and order\", she said.\n\nsa-gle/pjm/fox", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"},

No representatives of Hasina's party were present.\n\nSixteen other people have been included in the interim Cabinet with members drawn mainly from civil society and including two of the student protest leaders. The Cabinet members were chosen in discussions this week among student leaders, civil society representatives and the military.\n\nHasina quit on Monday after several chaotic weeks that began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina's party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasina's 15-year rule, as more than 300 people including students were killed amid spiraling violence.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his best wishes to Yunus in a statement on social media platform X, and alluded to reports that Hindus in Muslim-majority Bangladesh had been targeted during the country's unrest in recent days.\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" Modi said. \"India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.\"\n\nYunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in the French capital for the 2024 Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role, and returned home earlier Thursday to tight security at the airport in Dhaka.\n\nIn his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. \"Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,\" Yunus said, flanked by student leaders. \"It has immense possibility.\"\n\nOn Wednesday in Paris, Yunus had called for calm and an end to all partisan violence.\n\nHasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, vowed Wednesday that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladesh's politics -- a reversal from what he'd said earlier in the week after Hasina stepped down Monday and fled to India.\n\nThe president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration.\n\nOn Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.\n\nYunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a \"bloodsucker\" allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.\n\nThe chaos on Bangladesh's streets continued after Hasina's resignation on Monday. Dozens of police officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured. The looting of firearms also was reported in local media.\n\nThe unrest began in mid-July with protests over the quota system, but grew into a broader challenge over an administration that was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on opponents.\n\nJoy, Hasina's son, said in a social media post on Wednesday that his family would return to politics despite what he said have been attacks on the Awami League party over the past week. Many observers see Joy as Hasina's successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nation's politics.\n\n\"If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League,\" he said. \"The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh.\"\n\nOvernight into Thursday, residents across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighborhoods amid reports of robberies. Communities used loudspeakers in mosques to alert people that robberies were occurring, and police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for people seeking help.\n\nThe quick move to select Yunus came when Hasina's resignation created a power vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule, messy politics and myriad crises.\n\nMany fear that Hasina's departure could trigger even more instability in the densely populated nation of some 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.\n\nHasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, in an election boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the vote, and the U.S. and U.K. denounced the result as not credible.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(AFP)\n\nEarlier on Thursday MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in his weekly media briefing, \"I saw reports that the swearing-in ceremony is to be held this evening. I don't know the exact time, somewhere around 8'o clock. Diplomatic community members have been invited. It is likely that our High Commissioner will participate,\"\n\nIndia Today Global had learnt that Indian High Commissioner along with other officials were invited for the swearing-in ceremony.\n\nYunus, 84, took the oath at the presidential palace in Dhaka on Thursday night. The ceremony was attended by political leaders, civil society leaders, generals and diplomats.\n\n\"I will uphold, support and protect the constitution,\" Yunus said as he was administered the oath by President Mohammed Shahabuddin, adding that he will perform his duties \"sincerely\".\n\nThis comes at a time when concerns are being raised regarding human rights violations and attacks on minorities, particularly the Hindu community in Bangladesh. India has raised concerns regarding the safety of Hindus in the neighbouring country. Prime Minister Modi in a tweet wished Professor Yunus upon taking charge, but also called for protection of minorities.\n\nHe wrote, \"My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.\"\n\nThe MEA Spokesperson also highlighted India's concerns during the briefing when he said, \"We are also monitoring the situation as you know with regard to the status of minorities. There are also reports that various initiatives have been taken by groups and organizations to ensure the protection and well-being of the minorities. I would like to reiterate what External Affairs Minister had said in the Parliament. We welcome these steps but will naturally remain deeply concerned till law and order is visibly restored. Having said that, we also want to make it clear that, it is the responsibility of every government to ensure well-being of all its citizens. We hope for early restoration of law and order in Bangladesh. This is both in the interest of the country itself and for the region as a whole or the larger region as a whole.\"\n\nAdding, \"We are engaged with authorities in Dhaka. We have before us an evolving situation. As a close friend of the people of Bangladesh, it is our understanding that we want restoration of peace and stability in the country as soon as possible so that normal life can begin, so that we can\u00e2\u0080\u00e6 all the things that you have talked about, they can be looked after and we can take the interest of the people of Bangladesh and our own interests forward.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at a routine briefing in Washington on Wednesday, U.S. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller expressed that the U.S. expects Bangladesh's interim government to uphold democratic principles, the rule of law, and the desires of the Bangladeshi populace. Miller also stated that the U.S. views the interim administration as crucial in securing enduring peace and political stability in Bangladesh.\n\nMuhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and economist, has officially assumed leadership of Bangladesh's transitional government, following the resignation and subsequent departure of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India. Yunus and over a dozen cabinet members, designated as advisers rather than ministers, took their oaths of office. This interim administration aims to stabilize the nation and organize upcoming elections.\n\nThe new cabinet features prominent figures including Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, leaders of the Students Against Discrimination movement, which played a significant role in the protests leading to Hasina's exit. The group also includes Touhid Hossain, the former foreign secretary, Hassan Ariff, the ex-attorney general, Syeda Rizwana Hasan, an environmental lawyer acclaimed for her work, and Asif Nazrul, a respected law professor and author. Additionally, human rights advocate Adilur Rahman Khan, previously imprisoned under Hasina's regime, has joined as an adviser.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "geeta_mohan@indiatoday.in", "name": "Geeta Mohan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rizwana_Hasan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rizwana Hasan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oath of office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202408/muhammad-yunus-091929419-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=x7KSS6PDwi5NcUAXFJ3HtQW2lHvoRl2U", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801989", "eventUri": "eng-9801989", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Mr Yunus, 84, was administered the oath of office by President Mohammed Shahabuddin at a ceremony at the presidential palace \"Bangabhaban\".\n\nThe economist-turned-politician was appointed as the head of the interim government on Tuesday after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India following widespread protests against her government over a controversial quota system for jobs.\n\nMinutes after Mr Yunus was sworn-in, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated him. He also strongly raised the need for the new interim government in Bangladesh to ensure the protection of minorities, including Hindus, in the strife-torn country.\n\nMr Modi said: \"India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfil the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister posted on X: \"My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities.\"\n\nMr Modi's message to Dhaka signals that New Delhi is keen to continue its friendship with the people of Bangladesh, irrespective of the government in power there.\n\nAccording to media reports from Dhaka, Mr Yunus oath-taking ceremony at the presidential palace in Dhaka was attended by political leaders, civil society leaders, Amry Generals and diplomats.\n\n\"I will uphold, support and protect the constitution,\" Mr Yunus was quoted as saying while he was administered the oath by Mr Shahabuddin.\n\nAccording to reports, more than a dozen members of his Cabinet, whose titles are advisers, not ministers, also took the oath, as the caretaker government will now seek to restore peace and prepare for new elections.\n\nThe new Cabinet reportedly includes Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, top leaders of the Students Against Discrimination group, which led the weeks-long protests that ousted Ms Hasina. Others include former foreign secretary Touhid Hossain and former attorney-general Hassan Ariff.\n\nAward-winning environmental lawyer Syeda Rizwana Hasan and top law professor and writer Syeda Rizwana Hasan were also reportedly sworn in. Adilur Rahman Khan, a prominent human rights activist who was sentenced to two years in jail by the Hasina government, also reportedly took the oath as an adviser.\n\nHours before taking charge as the head of Bangladesh's new interim government, Mr Yunus, who reached Dhaka from Paris on Thursday, said that restoration of law and order is the priority of the new government. He urged all to refrain from any violence amid reports of attacks on minorities and others in his country.\n\nMr Yunus also hailed the successful protests by students as a \"second independence\" for Bangladesh, which gained its freedom from Pakistan over half a century ago.\n\nAmid efforts to form an interim government in Bangladesh, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, son of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled her country on Monday, told news agencies his mother will definitely return to her country once democracy is restored, either as a \"retired or active\" politician.\n\nSpeaking with PTI, Mr Joy said, \"Yes, it is true that I had said she (Ms Hasina) wouldn't return to Bangladesh. But a lot has changed in the last two days following continuous attacks on our leaders and party workers across the country. Now we are going to do whatever it takes to keep our people safe; we are not going to leave them alone.\"\n\nHe added: \"The Awami League is the largest and oldest political party in Bangladesh, so we cannot just walk away from our people. She will definitely return to Bangladesh once democracy is restored.\"\n\nThis comes amid uncertainty over the future plans of Ms Hasina, who fled to Delhi following her ouster from power after her country's Army refused to back her against protests from students and political groups demanding her removal.\n\nMr Yunus himself, a bitter critic of Sheikh Hasina and the new interim government, backed by students and anti-India political parties and groups such as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami, may demand the extradition of Ms Hasina from India to stand trial in a probe on police firings during the recent protests that caused the death of scores of protesters including students.\n\nThere is also some unease in New Delhi that the interim government in Dhaka may not take kindly to any long-term presence of Ms Hasina on Indian soil. There have been reports that Ms Hasina is therefore considering a range of possible destinations in Europe or the Gulf where she can proceed from India to settle down.\n\nWhile Ms Hasina has always been viewed as a friend of India, which is why she was permitted to land in Delhi, India is keen to avoid any major irritant with the new government in Dhaka. Whether New Delhi facilitates or lends its assistance for a swift and dignified exit for Ms Hasina to a safe destination abroad in Europe or the Gulf remains to be seen.", "source": {"uri":

Yunus, 84, assumes leadership following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India amidst ongoing protests and violence. During the oath-taking ceremony, which was attended by political leaders, civil society representatives, and diplomats, Yunus pledged to uphold and protect the constitution and vowed to perform his duties \"sincerely.\"\n\nIn addition to Yunus, over a dozen members of his interim cabinet were sworn in. The new advisers include prominent figures such as Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, leaders of the Students Against Discrimination group, and other notable individuals like Syeda Rizwana Hasan, an award-winning environmental lawyer, and Asif Nazrul, a law professor and writer. Notably absent were representatives of Hasina's Awami League party. Yunus, who had been in Paris for the 2024 Olympics, returned to Bangladesh earlier this week under tight security and emphasized his commitment to restoring order and unity in the country.\n\nInternational reactions have been supportive, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the United States extending their best wishes and expressing a willingness to work with the new interim government. The U.S. State Department welcomed Yunus's call for an end to recent violence and committed to cooperating with the interim administration as it navigates towards a democratic future. Yunus has faced past controversies, including a recent acquittal in a labor law case, but remains a pivotal figure in Bangladesh's quest for political stability.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.net.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oath of office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rizwana_Hasan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rizwana Hasan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asif_Nazrul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asif Nazrul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/tribune%2F2024-08-08%2F829pjupo%2FNobel%20Peace%20Prize%20laureate%20Muhammad%20Yunus.png?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801989", "eventUri": "eng-9801989", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The Grameen Bank he founded won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for helping lift millions from poverty by providing tiny loans to the rural poor who are too impoverished to gain attention from traditional banks, said Reuters.\n\nAs chief adviser of the caretaker government, he is, however, tasked with bringing stability back to the country which witnessed some of its worst violence in decades and then hold fresh parliamentary elections.\n\n\"The country has the possibility of becoming a very beautiful nation,\" Yunus earlier told reporters when he arrived in Dhaka following medical treatment in Paris, after protesters backed him for the role in a caretaker government.\n\nThe student protesters had saved the country, he said, adding: \"Whatever path our students show us, we will move ahead with that.\"\n\nA harsh critic of Hasina, Yunus became emotional and seemed to hold his tears back as he referred to a student he said had been shot during the protests and that sacrifice could not be forgotten.\n\n\"Now again we have to rise up. To the government officials here and defense chiefs - we are a family, we should move ahead together,\" he said.\n\nHasina's flight from the country she ruled for 20 of the last 30 years after winning a fourth term in January triggered jubilation and violence as crowds stormed and ransacked her official residence.\n\nMany Hindu homes, temples and businesses were vandalized after Hasina's departure, and hundreds in the minority community have tried unsuccessfully to flee to India this week. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council said a school teacher was killed and 45 other people hurt.\n\nMany Hindus have traditionally supported Hasina's Awami League party, which identifies as secular.\n\nPOWER VACUUM\n\nYunus' swearing-in plugged the power vacuum in the South Asian country of 170 million people with the fourth-largest Muslim population in the world, created after Hasina resigned and flew to India on Monday.\n\nPresident Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath of office to Yunus and 13 advisers who will help him govern, at a brief ceremony in the official presidential residence.\n\nThree more advisers will be sworn in at a later date, officials said.\n\nNahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, two student leaders who are both in their mid-20s and led the protests, were among the 13 who joined the caretaker government.\n\nThe ceremony started with a minute's silence as a mark of respect to the hundreds who were killed in the protests and clashes that erupted in July.\n\nThe army played a critical role towards the end of the crisis, conveying to Hasina that troops would not open fire on civilians to enforce a curfew declared on Sunday, sealing her fate, Reuters reported.\n\nHasina's Awami League party does not figure in the interim government. In a Facebook post, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said the party had not given up, and was ready to hold talks with opponents and the interim government.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) boycotted two national elections after the arrest of its leaders and has demanded fresh elections in three months.\n\nPROTECT HINDUS, INDIA URGES\n\nHasina is sheltering in the New Delhi area, a development that Yunus said caused anger at India among some Bangladeshis. India's foreign ministry said it had no update on Hasina's travel plans and it was up to her to \"take things forward\".\n\nThe neighbors have longstanding cultural and business ties and New Delhi played a key role in the 1971 war with Pakistan which led to the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Yunus and said New Delhi was committed to working with Dhaka to fulfill the \"shared aspirations\" of the people of both countries for \"peace, security and development\".\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" he said.\n\nThe student-led movement that ousted Hasina grew out of protests against quotas in government jobs that spiraled in July, provoking a violent crackdown that drew global criticism, though the government denied using excessive force.\n\nThe protests were fueled also by harsh economic conditions and political repression. The COVID-19 pandemic damaged the $450 billion economy after years of strong growth, leading to high inflation, unemployment and shrinking reserves.\n\nIt pushed the Hasina government to seek a $4.7 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Grameen Bank he founded won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for helping lift millions from poverty by providing tiny loans to the rural poor who are too impoverished to gain attention from traditional banks.\n\nAs chief adviser of the caretaker government, he is, however, tasked with bringing stability back to the country which witnessed some of its worst violence in decades and then hold fresh parliamentary elections.\n\n\"The country has the possibility of becoming a very beautiful nation,\" Yunus earlier told reporters when he arrived in Dhaka following medical treatment in Paris, after protesters backed him for the role in a caretaker set up.\n\nThe student protesters had saved the country, he said, adding: \"Whatever path our students show us, we will move ahead with that.\"\n\nA harsh critic of Hasina, Yunus became emotional and seemed to hold his tears back as he referred to a student he said had been shot during the protests and that sacrifice could not be forgotten. \"Now again we have to rise up. To the government officials here and defence chiefs -- we are a family, we should move ahead together,\" he said.\n\nHasina's flight from the country she ruled for 20 of the last 30 years after winning a fourth term in January triggered jubilation and violence as crowds stormed and ransacked her official residence. Many Hindu homes, temples and businesses were vandalised after Hasina's departure, and hundreds in the minority community have tried unsuccessfully to flee to India this week. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council said a schoolteacher was killed and 45 other people hurt.\n\nMany Hindus have traditionally supported Hasina's Awami League party, which identifies as secular.\n\nPresident Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath of office to Yunus and 13 advisers who will help him govern, at a brief ceremony in the official presidential residence.\n\nThree more advisers will be sworn in at a later date, officials said. Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, two student leaders who are both in their mid-20s and led the protests, were among the 13 who joined the caretaker government.\n\nThe ceremony started with a minute's silence as a mark of respect to the hundreds who were killed in the protests and clashes that erupted in July. The army played a critical role towards the end of the crisis, conveying to Hasina that troops would not open fire on civilians to enforce a curfew declared on Sunday, sealing her fate, Reuters reported.\n\nHasina's Awami League party does not figure in the interim government. In a Facebook post, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said the party had not given up and was ready to hold talks with opponents and the interim government. Hasina is sheltering in the New Delhi area, a development that Yunus said caused anger at India among some Bangladeshis. India's foreign ministry said it had no update on Hasina's travel plans and it was up to her to \"take things forward\". The neighbours have longstanding cultural and business ties.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Yunus and said New Delhi was committed to working with Dhaka to fulfill the \"shared aspirations\" of the people of both countries for \"peace, security and development\". \"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Grameen Bank he founded won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for helping lift millions from poverty by providing tiny loans to the rural poor who are too impoverished to gain attention from traditional banks.\n\nAs chief adviser of the caretaker government, he is, however, tasked with bringing stability back to the country which witnessed some of its worst violence in decades and then hold fresh parliamentary elections.\n\n\"The brutal, autocratic regime is gone,\" Yunus said in a televised address to the nation after taking charge. \"Tomorrow, with the rising sun, democracy, justice, human rights, and full freedom of fearless expression will be enjoyed by all, regardless of party affiliation. That is our goal.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, on his arrival in Dhaka following medical treatment in Paris, Yunus said he would govern it with the guidance of students who backed him for the role in the caretaker government.\n\nA harsh critic of Hasina, Yunus became emotional and seemed to hold his tears back at the airport as he referred to a student he said had been shot during the protests and that sacrifice could not be forgotten.\n\nHasina's flight from the country she ruled for 20 of the last 30 years after winning a fourth term in January triggered jubilation and violence as crowds stormed and ransacked her official residence.\n\nMany Hindu homes, temples and businesses were vandalised after Hasina's departure, and hundreds in the minority community have tried unsuccessfully to flee to India this week. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council said a schoolteacher was killed and 45 other people hurt.\n\nMany Hindus have traditionally supported Hasina's Awami League party, which identifies as secular.\n\nYunus' swearing-in plugged the power vacuum in the South Asian country of 170 million people with the fourth-largest Muslim population in the world, created after Hasina resigned and flew to India on Monday.\n\nPresident Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath of office to Yunus and 13 advisers who will help him govern, at a brief ceremony in the official presidential residence.\n\n[[nid:696551]]\n\nThree more advisers will be sworn in at a later date, officials said. Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, two student leaders who are both in their mid-20s and led the protests, were among the 13 who joined the caretaker government.\n\nThe ceremony started with a minute's silence to honour the hundreds who were killed in the protests and clashes that erupted in July.\n\nThe army played a critical role towards the end of the crisis, conveying to Hasina that troops would not open fire on civilians to enforce a curfew declared on Sunday, sealing her fate, Reuters reported.\n\nHasina's Awami League party does not figure in the interim government. In a Facebook post, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said the party had not given up, and was ready to hold talks with opponents and the interim government.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) boycotted two national elections after the arrest of its leaders and has demanded fresh elections in three months.\n\nHasina is sheltering in the New Delhi area, a development that Yunus said caused anger at India among some Bangladeshis. India's foreign ministry said it had no update on Hasina's travel plans and it was up to her to \"take things forward\".\n\nThe neighbours have longstanding cultural and business ties and New Delhi played a key role in the 1971 war with Pakistan which led to the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Yunus and said New Delhi was committed to working with Dhaka to fulfil the \"shared aspirations\" of the people of both countries for \"peace, security and development\".\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" he said.\n\nThe student-led movement that ousted Hasina grew out of protests against quotas in government jobs that spiralled in July, provoking a violent crackdown that drew global criticism, though the government denied using excessive force.\n\nThe protests were fuelled also by harsh economic conditions and political repression. The Covid-19 pandemic damaged the US$450 billion (S$600 billion) economy after years of strong growth, leading to high inflation, unemployment and shrinking reserves.\n\nIt pushed the Hasina government to seek a US$4.7 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.\n\n[embed]https://youtu.be/qBO-2h_uELY?si=zPtvA3Gc1GDkM47o[/embed]", "source": {"uri": "asiaone.com", "dataType": "news",

Without this, my efforts are futile, and it would be better if I stepped aside.\" He was further quoted as saying: \"Violence is our enemy. Let's not create more. Be calm and prepare to build our nation.\" It is unclear whether the comment was made in the run-up to or after the swearing-in ceremony.\n\nMr Yunus was the unanimous choice of the student leaders as the country's new leader after their protests led to the ouster of Sheikh Hasina as Prime Minister on Monday. Political groups opposed to Ms Hasina had also joined the student protests. Mr Yunus has the unenviable task of rebuilding his conflict-torn nation and is expected to continue till fresh elections are held in the coming months.\n\nAs indicated earlier by the external affairs ministry Thursday, New Delhi on Friday said the Indian high commissioner in Dhaka had attended the swearing-in ceremony of Mr Yunus, a bitter critic of Sheikh Hasina, who was seen as a close friend of India and is currently holed up in New Delhi, where she fled on Monday evening. New Delhi has a robust development assistance partnership with Dhaka, where the Army took over charge on the sudden resignation and exit of Sheikh Hasina.\n\nIt may be noted that soon after the Nobel Laureate was sworn in late on Thursday evening in Dhaka, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had congratulated him and at the same time strongly raised the need for the new interim government in Bangladesh to ensure the protection of minorities there, including Hindus. Mr Modi had added that \"India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfil the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development\".\n\nThe Prime Minister posted on X: \"My best wishes to Prof. Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities.\"\n\nConfirmation by New Delhi on Friday of the Indian high commissioner having attended the swearing-in ceremony and also Mr Modi's message to Dhaka signals that New Delhi is keen to continue its friendship with the people of Bangladesh irrespective of the government in power there. Sheikh Hasina was ousted from power as PM earlier this week after the protests by students and political groups. Mr Modi's reference to the need for Bangladesh to protect its minorities, including Hindus, is a politically-important one to Dhaka and comes amid selective targeting of Hindu homes and temples by a section of the protesters in recent days.\n\nAccording to media reports earlier on Thursday from Dhaka, Mr Yunus, 84, took the oath during a ceremony at the presidential palace in Dhaka on Thursday night that was attended by political leaders, civil society leaders, generals and diplomats. \"I will uphold, support and protect the Constitution,\" Mr Yunus was quoted as saying, as he was administered the oath by President Mohammed Shahabuddin.", "source": {"uri": "deccanchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Chronicle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sridhar_kumaraswami@deccanchronicle.com", "name": "Sridhar Kumaraswami", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/08/09/1829896-guecmsda8aykg92.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801989", "eventUri": "eng-9801989", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"\n\nYunus called for the restoration of order in the South Asian nation after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\n\"Law and order is our first task... We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation,\" he said.\n\n\"My call to the people is if you have trust in me, then make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country.\"\n\n\"Every person is our brother... our task is to protect them,\" Yunus said, adding that \"the whole of Bangladesh is one big family\".\n\nMore than a dozen members of his cabinet -- given the title of advisers, not ministers -- also took the oath.\n\nThe group included two top leaders of the Students Against Discrimination group that led the weeks-long protests, Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud.\n\nOthers included a former foreign secretary, a former attorney general, an environmental lawyer, and prominent rights activist Adilur Rahman Khan, who was sentenced to two years in jail during Hasina's rule.\n\nThe caretaker administration is a civilian team, bar one retired brigadier-general.\n\nHasina, accused of widespread human rights abuses including the jailing of her political opponents, was forced to flee to neighbouring India on Monday as masses of protesters flooded Dhaka's streets.\n\nThe military then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel prize in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.\n\nYunus choked with emotion Thursday as he recalled the killing of student activist Abu Sayeed, shot dead in July by police from close range.\n\nHe paid tribute to the youth who sparked the protest movement and those who risked all for their desire for change.\n\n\"They protected the nation and gave it a new life\", he said.\n\n- 'Beautiful democratic process' -\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his \"best wishes\" to Yunus, saying New Delhi -- which had close ties with Hasina -- was \"committed\" to working with Dhaka.\n\nThe United States and European Union also voiced readiness to work with the interim government, with State Department spokesman Matthew Miller saying Washington hoped to work together as Bangladesh \"charts a democratic future\".\n\nDuring Hasina's reign, Yunus was hit with more than 100 criminal cases and a smear campaign by a state-led Islamic agency that accused him of promoting homosexuality.\n\nYunus had travelled abroad this year while on bail after being sentenced to six months in jail on a charge condemned as politically motivated. A Dhaka court acquitted him of that charge on Wednesday.\n\nArmy chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said Wednesday he supported Yunus.\n\n\"I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process,\" Waker said.\n\nBangladeshis voiced hope for the future at a rally in Dhaka on Wednesday for the former opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP), whose chairperson, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, 78, was released from years of house arrest.\n\n\"I expect that the country is run in a nice way, and the police force is reformed so that they can't harass people,\" Moynul Islam Pintu told AFP.\n\nMonday's events were the culmination of more than a month of unrest, which began as protests against a quota plan for government jobs but morphed into an anti-Hasina movement.\n\n\"The protests are a seismic moment in Bangladesh history,\" said International Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean.\n\n\"The country really had been at risk of becoming a one-party state, and through a peaceful street-based movement led by Gen Z students in their 20s, they've managed to force her from power.\"\n\n- Military move -\n\nThe military's switching of allegiance was the decisive factor in her ouster. It has since acceded to a range of demands from the student leaders.\n\nThe president on Tuesday dissolved parliament and sacked the head of the police force, who protesters had blamed for leading Hasina's crackdown.\n\nThe new chief, Mainul Islam, offered an apology Wednesday for the conduct of officers and vowed a \"fair and impartial investigation\" into the killings of \"students, common people and the police\".\n\nBesides Zia, some other political prisoners were freed.\n\nThe military has demoted some generals seen as close to Hasina and sacked Ziaul Ahsan, a commander of the feared

Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"\n\nYunus called for the restoration of order in the South Asian nation after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\n\"Law and order is our first task... We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation,\" he said.\n\n\"My call to the people is if you have trust in me, then make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country.\"\n\n\"Every person is our brother... our task is to protect them,\" Yunus said, adding that \"the whole of Bangladesh is one big family\".\n\nMore than a dozen members of his cabinet - given the title of advisers, not ministers - also took the oath.\n\nThe group included two top leaders of the Students Against Discrimination group that led the weeks-long protests, Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud.\n\nOthers included a former foreign secretary, a former attorney general, an environmental lawyer, and prominent rights activist Adilur Rahman Khan, who was sentenced to two years in jail during Hasina's rule.\n\nThe caretaker administration is a civilian team, bar one retired brigadier-general.\n\nHasina, accused of widespread human rights abuses including the jailing of her political opponents, was forced to flee to neighbouring India on Monday as masses of protesters flooded Dhaka's streets.\n\nThe military then agreed to student demands that Yunus - who won the Nobel prize in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work - lead an interim government.\n\nYunus choked with emotion Thursday as he recalled the killing of student activist Abu Sayeed, shot dead in July by police from close range.\n\nHe paid tribute to the youth who sparked the protest movement and those who risked all for their desire for change.\n\n\"They protected the nation and gave it a new life\", he said.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his \"best wishes\" to Yunus, saying New Delhi - which had close ties with Hasina - was \"committed\" to working with Dhaka.\n\nThe United States and European Union also voiced readiness to work with the interim government, with State Department spokesman Matthew Miller saying Washington hoped to work together as Bangladesh \"charts a democratic future\".\n\nDuring Hasina's reign, Yunus was hit with more than 100 criminal cases and a smear campaign by a state-led Islamic agency that accused him of promoting homosexuality.\n\nYunus had travelled abroad this year while on bail after being sentenced to six months in jail on a charge condemned as politically motivated. A Dhaka court acquitted him of that charge on Wednesday.\n\nArmy chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said Wednesday he supported Yunus.\n\n\"I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process,\" Waker said.\n\nBangladeshis voiced hope for the future at a rally in Dhaka on Wednesday for the former opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP), whose chairperson, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, 78, was released from years of house arrest.\n\n\"I expect that the country is run in a nice way, and the police force is reformed so that they can't harass people,\" Moynul Islam Pintu told AFP.\n\nMonday's events were the culmination of more than a month of unrest, which began as protests against a quota plan for government jobs but morphed into an anti-Hasina movement.\n\n\"The protests are a seismic moment in Bangladesh history,\" said International Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean.\n\n\"The country really had been at risk of becoming a one-party state, and through a peaceful street-based movement led by Gen Z students in their 20s, they've managed to force her from power.\"\n\nThe military's switching of allegiance was the decisive factor in her ouster. It has since acceded to a range of demands from the student leaders.\n\nThe president on Tuesday dissolved parliament and sacked the head of the police force, who protesters had blamed for leading Hasina's crackdown.\n\nThe new chief, Mainul Islam, offered an apology Wednesday for the conduct of officers and vowed a \"fair and impartial investigation\" into the killings of \"students, common people and the police\".\n\nBesides Zia, some other political prisoners were freed.\n\nThe military has demoted some generals seen as close to Hasina and sacked Ziaul Ahsan, a commander of the feared Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Waker-Uz-Zaman, who was flanked by navy and air force heads.\n\nSome of the student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. They had earlier proposed Yunus as interim leader to the country's figurehead president, who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution.\n\nIn his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order.\n\n\"Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,\" Yunus said, flanked by the student leaders. \"It has immense possibility.\"\n\nHe urged all to stop violence and promised not to resort to any repressive measures against anyone.\n\nSecurity was tight at the airport to ensure Yunus' safe arrival, as the country has experienced days of unrest following the downfall of Hasina on Monday. President Mohammed Shahabuddin will administer the oath-taking ceremony last night when Yunus is expected to announce his new Cabinet.\n\nBefore leaving Paris, where he was attending the Olympics, Yunus appealed for calm in Bangladesh amid tensions over the country's future.\n\nHasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, vowed Wednesday that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladesh's politics -- a reversal from what he'd said earlier in the week after Hasina stepped down Monday and fled to India.\n\nYunuswas named as interim leader following talks among military officials, civic leaders and the student activists who led the uprising against Hasina. Yunus made his first public comments in the French capital on Wednesday before boarding a plane to return home.\n\nYunus congratulated the student protesters, saying they had made \"our second Victory Day possible,\" and he appealed to them and other stakeholders to remain peaceful, while condemning the violence that followed Hasina's resignation.\n\n\"Violence is our enemy. Please don't create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country,\" Yunus said.\n\nBangladesh's military chief, Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman, said in a televised address on Wednesday that he expected Yunus to usher in a \"beautiful democratic\" process.\n\nYunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, told reporters in Paris: \"I'm looking forward to going back home and seeing what's happening there, and how we can organize ourselves to get out of the trouble that we are in.\"\n\nAsked when elections would be held, he put his hands up as if to indicate it was too early to say.\n\n\"I'll go and talk to them. I'm just fresh in this whole area,\" he said.\n\nA tribunal in Dhaka earlier on Wednesday acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.\n\nThe president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for an interim administration that is expected to schedule new elections.\n\nYunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a \"bloodsucker\" allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.\n\nIn a span of weeks since July 15, more than 300 people died in violence in Bangladesh. Rising tensions in the days surrounding Hasina's resignation created chaos, with police leaving their posts after being attacked. Dozens of officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured. The looting of firearms was also reported in local media.\n\nThe chaos began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina's party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a broader challenge to Hasina's 15-year rule, which was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on her opponents.\n\nJoy, Hasina's son, said in a social media post on Wednesday that his family would return to politics and not give up following attacks on the Awami League party's leaders and members. Many see Joy as Hasina's successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nation's politics.\n\nOn Monday, Joy had said Hasina would not return to politics after she stepped down. But in a video message posted on his Facebook page on Wednesday, he urged party activists to rise up.\n\n\"You are not alone. We are here. The family of Bangabandhu has not gone anywhere,\" he said.\n\nHasina's father, independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, is fondly referred to in Bangladesh as Bangabandhu, which means \"friend of Bengal.\"\n\n\"If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League,\" he said.\n\n\"The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh,\" Joy added. \"The Awami League has not died ... It is not possible to eliminate the Awami League. We had said that our family would not engage in politics anymore. However, given the attacks on our leaders and activists, we cannot give up.\"\n\nOvernight into Thursday, residents across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighborhoods amid reports of robberies. Communities used loudspeakers in mosques to alert people that robberies were occurring, as police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for people seeking help.\n\nThe quick move to select Yunus came when Hasina's resignation created a power vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule, messy politics and myriad crises.\n\nMany fear that Hasina's departure could trigger even more instability in the densely populated nation of some 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.", "source": {"uri": "macaudailytimes.com.mo", "dataType":

No mention was made at the ceremony of how long the interim government will be in power.\n\nBangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin, whose role is largely symbolic, administered the oath to Yunus and the others at the presidential palace in Dhaka.\n\n\"I will uphold, support and protect the constitution and will perform my duties sincerely,\" Yunus said as part of his oath.\n\nYunus now has the title of chief advisor and leads a body of 16 who comprise the rest of the interim administration.\n\nTaking the oath alongside Yunus were more than a dozen individuals from diverse fields, including two university students who became familiar faces to Bangladeshis in recent days.\n\nThe Dhaka University students, Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, were key figures in student protests that turned deadly and became a mass movement demanding Hasina step down.\n\nThe interim government also includes human rights activists, legal experts, two ex-diplomats, a doctor and a former governor of Bangladesh's central bank. A BenarNews reporter at the scene did not see anyone from Hasina's Awami League party.\n\nThe swearing-in ceremony, which began around 8 p.m. was attended by judges, NGO leaders, chiefs of the three branches of the military, the country's new police chief, foreign diplomats and leaders of political parties.\n\nYunus won the Nobel for lifting millions out of poverty by lending them small amounts of cash - microloans - to open small businesses. His microlending model has been replicated in more than 100 countries - though he was reviled by Hasina and, according to supporters, subjected to judicial harassment during her administration.\n\nA student in Dhaka, Salma Akhter, of Tejgaon College, was excited at the prospect of Yunus heading the new government.\n\n\"He is a reputed person. What we need is a visionary leader who will not amass wealth through corrupt practices. And will not involve him in corrupt practices,\" she told BenarNews.\n\n\"We hope the government will carry out institutional reforms and restore democratic institutions before holding national elections.\"\n\nYunus had been in Paris when it was announced that he had been selected to lead the interim administration and arrived back home just hours before the oath-taking ceremony, on Thursday afternoon.\n\nHe was welcomed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport by the Army chief Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman, some student leaders and civil society representatives.\n\nUpon landing, he alluded to the fact that Hasina had bent state institutions to her will, including security agencies. But he urged people not to take the law into their own hands.\n\n\"Restoring the law and order situation is our first job. We cannot take further steps until the law and order situation returns to normalcy,\" Yunus said.\n\nMore than 108 people have been killed in new violence since Hasina decamped on Monday, after weeks of civil unrest in which some 300 died.\n\nBangladeshis needed to regain faith in independent state institutions - faith they had lost during the 15 years of Hasina's continuous rule, Yunus said Wednesday.\n\n\"It is critical that trust in government be restored quickly,\" Yunus said in a statement, according to U.K.'s Financial Times.\n\n\"We need calm, we need a road map to new elections, and we need to get to work to prepare for new leadership in order to fulfill the extraordinary potential of Bangladesh.\"\n\nGreeting those who had come to receive him, Yunus was visibly emotional when students approached to shake his hand. With tears in his eyes, he ignored their outstretched hands and embraced them instead.\n\nBangladesh has an opportunity to start afresh thanks to the country's university students, he said at the airport on Thursday.\n\n\"Today is a glorious day for us . . . they [the students] protected and gave this country a rebirth,\" Yunus said after he landed.\n\n\"We have to protect it,\" he added.\n\nFollowing Hasina's resignation, the Students Movement Against Discrimination group proposed that Yunus lead the interim government, a choice South Asia observers viewed approvingly because the Nobel laureate is respected at home and abroad.\n\nThe group's students led the initial protests that turned deadly when security forces and Awami League supporters joined the fray in an attempt to disperse them. The violence angered people nationwide and the agitation became a mass movement demanding Hasina's resignation.\n\nBenarNews spoke to some newly appointed interim government members about what they believe should be the administration's first priority.\n\nAmong the issues mentioned by Saleh Uddin Ahmed, a former governor of the country's central bank, was the economy.\n\n\"The first step will be bringing back law and order, reactivating the slow economy, working for the people's welfare, and resuming the academic environment,\" he told BenarNews.\n\nReferring to the lives lost in recent weeks, human rights activist Adilur Rahman Khan said there needed to be accountability.\n\n\"We took this responsibility by standing in blood. We need to ensure justice, we need to bring public traitors to justice,\" he said.\n\n15 years\n\nAsif Mahmud, one of the two students named advisor on Thursday, said the interim government would \"reform\" state institutions, hold a free and fair general election and hand over power to an elected government.\n\n\"But that will not be possible without reforms to institutions such as the Election Commission,\" he told journalists after the oath-taking ceremony outside the presidential palace.\n\nHolding fair elections \"will not be possible without its reform,\" Asif said.\n\nAccording to the country's constitution, an election must be held within 90 days of parliament being dissolved. That happened on Tuesday, Aug. 6, which means the interim government's term ought to end early November\n\nBut one retired United States diplomat told BenarNews this week that may be unrealistic - that is, too short.\n\nHasina and her Awami League party had caused too much damage over her 15 consecutive years in power, said Jon Danilowicz, who has served three assignments in Bangladesh.\n\n\"I don't think we can say at this point how long the country will take to be ready for an election. Considering the degree to which the Awami League politicized the administration, security forces and judiciary, the task of unraveling all that will be very difficult and take very long,\" he said.\n\n\"But without doing that, it will not be possible to hold free, fair and credible elections.\"\n\nShailaja Neelakantan in Washington contributed to this report by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated

We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation,\" he said.\n\n\"My call to the people is if you have trust in me, then make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country.\"\n\n\"Every person is our brother... our task is to protect them,\" Yunus said, adding that \"the whole of Bangladesh is one big family\".\n\nMore than a dozen members of his cabinet -- given the title of advisers, not ministers -- also took the oath.\n\nThe group included two top leaders of the Students Against Discrimination group that led the weeks-long protests, Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud.\n\nOthers included a former foreign secretary and a former attorney general, an environmental lawyer, and prominent rights activist Adilur Rahman Khan, who was sentenced to two years in jail during Hasina's rule.\n\nThe caretaker administration is a civilian team, bar one retired brigadier-general.\n\nHasina, accused of widespread human rights abuses including the jailing of her political opponents, was forced to flee to neighbouring India on Monday as masses of protesters flooded Dhaka's streets.\n\nThe military then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel prize in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.\n\nYunus choked with emotion on Thursday as he recalled the killing of student activist Abu Sayeed, shot dead in July by police from close range.\n\nHe paid tribute to the youth who sparked the protest movement and those who risked all for their desire for change.\n\n\"They protected the nation and gave it a new life\", he said.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his \"best wishes\" to Yunus on Thursday, saying New Delhi was \"committed\" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.\n\n- 'Beautiful democratic process' -\n\nDuring Hasina's reign, Yunus was hit with more than 100 criminal cases and a smear campaign by a state-led Islamic agency that accused him of promoting homosexuality.\n\nYunus had travelled abroad this year while on bail after being sentenced to six months in jail on a charge condemned as politically motivated. A Dhaka court acquitted him of that charge on Wednesday.\n\nArmy chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said Wednesday he supported Yunus.\n\n\"I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process,\" Waker said.\n\nFew other details about the planned government have been released.\n\nBut Bangladeshis voiced hope as they joined a rally in Dhaka on Wednesday for the former opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP).\n\n\"I expect that the country is run in a nice way, and the police force is reformed so that they can't harass people,\" Moynul Islam Pintu told AFP.\n\nMonday's events were the culmination of more than a month of unrest, which began as protests against a quota plan for government jobs but morphed into an anti-Hasina movement.\n\n\"The protests are a seismic moment in Bangladesh history,\" said International Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean.\n\n\"The country really had been at risk of becoming a one-party state, and through a peaceful street-based movement led by Gen Z students in their 20s, they've managed to force her from power.\"\n\n- Military move -\n\nThe military's switching of allegiance was the decisive factor in her ouster. It has since acceded to a range of demands from the student leaders.\n\nThe president on Tuesday dissolved parliament, a key demand of the students and the BNP, and sacked the head of the police force, who protesters had blamed for leading Hasina's crackdown.\n\nThe new chief, Mainul Islam, offered an apology Wednesday for the conduct of officers and vowed a \"fair and impartial investigation\" into the killings of \"students, common people and the police\".\n\nEx-prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, 78, was released from years of house arrest, while some other political prisoners were also freed.\n\nThe military has demoted some generals seen as close to Hasina and sacked Ziaul Ahsan, a commander of the feared Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force.\n\nsa-pjm/sst/aha", "source": {"uri": "wfxg.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFXG FOX54"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shafiqul_alam@wfxg.com", "name": "Shafiqul Alam", "type": "author",

The 84-year-old microfinance pioneer will head the government until fresh polls are held. The parliament has already been dissolved by the nation's president Mohammed Shahabuddin.\n\n\"If action is needed in Bangladesh, for my country and for the courage of my people, then I will take it,\" Mr.Yunus said on Tuesday, a day after Ms. Hasina resigned and left the country.. He was called on by student coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement to head the interim government.\n\nBanker to the poor\n\n\"In Dr. Yunus, we trust,\" wrote Asif Mahmud, a key leader of the Students Against Discrimination (SAD) group, in a Facebook post, echoing the widespread acceptability Mr. Yunus has in Bangladesh's fractious polity.\n\nBorn on June 28, 1940, in Chittagong, East Bengal (now Bangladesh), Muhammad Yunus, the third of nine children, completed his primary education Lamabazar Primary School and then Chittagong Collegiate School. After completing both B.A. and M.A. in Economics from Dhaka University, he started his teaching career as a lecturer in the same university in 1961. Obtaining a PhD in economics from Vanderbilt University, Dr. Yunus began his tenure as an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, U.S., in 1969.\n\nAs war ravaged his homeland's struggle for liberation from Pakistan, Dr. Yunus lobbied the U.S. Congress to stop military aid to Pakistan. He also helped raise support for the Liberation movement by running a Bangladesh Information Center in Washington DC, a Citizen's Committee in Nashville, Tenessee and published the Bangladesh Newsletter.\n\nWith the birth of Bangladesh, he returned home, joining the Economics Department of University of Chittagong in 1972. As the newly-separated Bangladesh suffered a famine in 1974, he forayed into rural economics, introducing the Nabajug Tebhaga Khamar to study economic aspects of poverty and urged his students to lend a hand to farmers in fields. In his visits to farming households in Chittagong's Jobra region, he realised the necessity and effectiveness of small loans to women bamboo furniture makers, freeing them from claws of loan sharks. Initiating the first 'small loan', Dr. Yunus lent $27 to 42 families in Jobra to manufacture their items for sale.\n\nFILE- Muhammad Yunus, an economist from Bangladesh who founded the Grameen Bank and won a Nobel Peace Prize, is seen at the end of a press conference in Paris Monday Feb. 18, 2008.

In 1983, Grameen Bank was established, specialising on small loans, playing a pivotal role in eradicating poverty via micro-credit requiring no collateral. Over 100 nations, including India, have replicated this model. As of 2024, Grameen Bank has 2,568 branches across 81,678 villages with 10.61 million borrowers.\n\nDr. Yunus pioneering work in microfinance won him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for lending a social conscience to capitalism and \"their efforts to create economic and social development from below\" in Bangladesh. However, it also attracted legal woes in Bangladesh.\n\nBrief political foray\n\nAhead of the 2006 polls, the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) and Sheikh Hasina's Awami League (AL) failed to agree on a candidate to head the caretaker government, leading to imposition of a state of emergency in Bangladesh. With both Khaleda Zia and Kheikh Hasin incarcerated by the military-backed government for extortion charges, Mr. Yunus announced that he would contest in the next polls by forming the Nagorik Shakti party in February 2007. However, he dropped the plans within months due to lack of public support.\n\nClash with Hasina government\n\nOn taking power in 2009, Ms. Hasina's government began scrutinising Mr. Yunus and Grameen Bank. In 2011, he was removed as managing director of the microlending bank, as he had passed the retirement age of 60. While he challenged his ouster, he lost the court battle accusing Ms. Hasina of targetting him. On multiple occasions, Ms. Hasina has accused Mr. Yunus for influencing World Bank which cancelled a $1.2 billion credit for the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project in 2012 - a charge which he has refuted. Over 150 cases have been filed against Mr. Yunus as of 2023 by the Hasina government.\n\nThe micro-financing model itself came under the scanner after Mr. Yunus admitted that some organisations may have abused the system for profit. The lack of collateral in such loans have attracted high interest rates by some banks, leading to borrowers falling into more debt. In 2019, an arrest warrant was issued against Mr. Yunus for three alleged breaches under the Labour Act.\n\nWatch: Who is Muhammad Yunus, the head of Bangladesh's interim government?\n\nIn May 2023, Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) accused Mr. Yunus and several others of misusing the workers' welfare fund of Grameen Bank and regularising 101 staff members. After a lengthy trial, Mr. Yunus and his colleagues were convicted in January this year, mere days after Ms. Hasina began her fourth consecutive term as Prime minister.\n\n\"We have incurred the annoyance of someone because of chasing the three zero dream (zero poverty, zero unemployment and zero net carbon emissions),\" said Dr. Yunus after his conviction as thousands pleaded the then-PM to pardon him.\n\nWithin six months, chaos and violence was unleashed in Bangladesh due to anti-quota protests, leading stringent crackdown by police. As student protestors sought one single demand - resignation of Sheikh Hasina, the 78-year-old politician fled to India, ending her 15-year reign. Now Ms. Hasina, whose government sought to incarcerate him, is out of power and out of the country, while Mr. Yunus is heading an interim government, tasked with overseeing an orderly political transition.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type":

The Grameen Bank he founded won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for helping lift millions from poverty by providing tiny loans to the rural poor who are too impoverished to gain attention from traditional banks.\n\nAs chief adviser of the caretaker government, he is, however, tasked with bringing stability back to the country which witnessed some of its worst violence in decades and then hold fresh parliamentary elections.\n\n\"The brutal, autocratic regime is gone,\" Yunus said in a televised address to the nation after taking charge. \"Tomorrow, with the rising sun, democracy, justice, human rights, and full freedom of fearless expression will be enjoyed by all, regardless of party affiliation. That is our goal.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, on his arrival in Dhaka following medical treatment in Paris, Yunus said he would govern it with the guidance of students who backed him for the role in the caretaker government.\n\nA harsh critic of Hasina, Yunus became emotional and seemed to hold his tears back at the airport as he referred to a student he said had been shot during the protests and that sacrifice could not be forgotten.\n\nHasina's flight from the country she ruled for 20 of the last 30 years after winning a fourth term in January triggered jubilation and violence as crowds stormed and ransacked her official residence.\n\nMany Hindu homes, temples and businesses were vandalised after Hasina's departure, and hundreds in the minority community have tried unsuccessfully to flee to India this week. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council said a schoolteacher was killed and 45 other people hurt.\n\nMany Hindus have traditionally supported Hasina's Awami League party, which identifies as secular.\n\nPOWER VACUUM\n\nYunus' swearing-in plugged the power vacuum in the South Asian country of 170 million people with the fourth-largest Muslim population in the world, created after Hasina resigned and flew to India on Monday.\n\nPresident Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath of office to Yunus and 13 advisers who will help him govern, at a brief ceremony in the official presidential residence.\n\nThree more advisers will be sworn in at a later date, officials said. Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, two student leaders who are both in their mid-20s and led the protests, were among the 13 who joined the caretaker government.\n\nThe ceremony started with a minute's silence to honour the hundreds who were killed in the protests and clashes that erupted in July.\n\nThe army played a critical role towards the end of the crisis, conveying to Hasina that troops would not open fire on civilians to enforce a curfew declared on Sunday, sealing her fate, Reuters reported.\n\nHasina's Awami League party does not figure in the interim government. In a Facebook post, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said the party had not given up, and was ready to hold talks with opponents and the interim government.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) boycotted two national elections after the arrest of its leaders and has demanded fresh elections in three months.\n\nPROTECT HINDUS, INDIA URGES\n\nHasina is sheltering in the New Delhi area, a development that Yunus said caused anger at India among some Bangladeshis. India's foreign ministry said it had no update on Hasina's travel plans and it was up to her to \"take things forward\".\n\nThe neighbours have longstanding cultural and business ties and New Delhi played a key role in the 1971 war with Pakistan which led to the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Yunus and said New Delhi was committed to working with Dhaka to fulfil the \"shared aspirations\" of the people of both countries for \"peace, security and development\".\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" he said.\n\nThe student-led movement that ousted Hasina grew out of protests against quotas in government jobs that spiralled in July, provoking a violent crackdown that drew global criticism, though the government denied using excessive force.\n\nThe protests were fuelled also by harsh economic conditions and political repression. The COVID-19 pandemic damaged the $450 billion economy after years of strong growth, leading to high inflation, unemployment and shrinking reserves.\n\nIt pushed the Hasina government to seek a $4.7 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Modi congratulated Muhammad Yunus, who was sworn in as the country's interim leader after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country on being ousted on Monday.\n\nYunus, 84, a Nobel Peace Prize winner known for his banking initiatives to help the poor, was chosen to head the interim government. A longtime opponent of Hasina, one of his key tasks will be to restore peace in the nation and prepare for elections to form a new government.\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy,\" Modi said on X (formerly Twitter). He added that he hoped for the \"safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities.\"\n\nThe PM's appeal follows reports of attacks on the Hindu community in the crisis-hit nation. On Thursday, India's foreign ministry confirmed that it is \"monitoring\" the situation.\n\nAt present, Hindus make up about 9% of the Bangladeshi population.\n\nIndia has largely remained silent on the protests, in which around 300 people have been killed, last month describing the unrest as an \"internal matter.\"\n\nYunus recently said that he was disheartened by India's stance regarding the protests in his country. \"If there is a fire in the brother's house, how can I say it is an internal affair?\" he told The Indian Express earlier this week.

Yunus, known for founding Grameen Bank, returns to lead the caretaker government amid civil unrest. His appointment follows a demand from the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement and years of legal challenges.Dhaka, Life has come full circle for Professor Mohammad Yunus, a well-known critic of Sheikh Hasina and persecuted by her regime, when the Nobel laureate became the head of the caretaker government after she resigned and fled to India. The 84-year-old economist, globally recognised as 'The Father of Microfinance,' who flew down from Paris earlier in the day, was declared as the head of the interim government by President Mohammed Shahabuddin after dissolving Parliament Tuesday, a decision prompted by a demand by the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement.\n\nYunus had announced plans to form a political party in 2007 when the country was run by a military-backed government and criticised Bangladeshi politicians alleging they were only interested in money. He, however, did not follow through on that plan.\n\nBy a quirk of fate, on Thursday he took oath to lead a non-partisan, non-military caretaker government.\n\nYunus, who started as a Professor at national and international Universities, earned the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize and the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1984 among scores of other international recognitions.\n\nBut back home, the founder of the Grameen Bank had been in a protracted row with Hasina's government due to obscure reasons while authorities initiated a series of investigations against him after she came to power in 2008.\n\nBangladesh authorities launched a review of the Grameen Bank's activities in 2011 and fired Yunus as its founding managing director on charges of violating the government retirement regulation.\n\nOver the years, he was charged under dozens of cases. In January, a court sentenced Yunus to six months in jail on charges of labour law violation.\n\nOn June 10 this year, a Dhaka court prosecuted Yunus and 13 others - currently out on bail - for embezzling as it rejected a plea for the dismissal of charges by the accused.\n\nThe prosecution accused Yunus and the others of embezzling Taka 250 million (about USD 2 million) from the workers welfare fund of Grameen Telecom, which owns a 34.2 per cent stake in Bangladesh's largest mobile phone operator, Grameenphone, a subsidiary of Norway's telecom giant Telenor.\n\n\"She destroyed the legacy of her father Bangabandhu Mujibur Rahman. Bangladesh is liberated... We are a free country now,\" Yunus told an Indian portal on Monday from Paris after news broke out of Hasina fleeing the country amid civil unrest.\n\nNotwithstanding the Hasina government's stand, Yunus continued to receive international accolades as was evident by the speech by Susanna B Afan, president of the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation, on June 27 this year at Manila.\n\nAfan stated that the work by Yunus, globally recognised as 'The Father of Microfinance' has not just inspired similar projects in the Philippines, Indonesia and Pakistan but their respective founders too received the Ramon Magsaysay Award.\n\nBorn in pre-Independence India in 1940 in Chittagong, Yunus first studied at Dhaka University in Bangladesh, which was then East Pakistan; went as a Fulbright scholar to study economics at Vanderbilt University in the US and obtained PhD in economics in 1969.\n\nThe very next year, he became an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University in the US but returned to Bangladesh to head the economics department at Chittagong University.\n\nEarlier, in 1984, Yunus was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership for \"his pioneering efforts in enabling rural men and women to become economically self-sufficient through sound group-managed credit.\"\n\nThe 2006 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for his work in poverty alleviation and the empowerment of poor women through Grameen Bank where Yunus has \"successfully melded capitalism with social responsibility\" through the microcredit institution.\n\nApart from multiple national awards, Professor Yunus is the recipient of numerous international awards for his ideas and endeavours from countries including Sri Lanka, USA, Jordan, Sweden, Japan, The Netherlands, and South Korea.\n\nPublished on January 1, 1991, his autobiography, 'Banker to the Poor: Microlending and the Battle Against World Poverty,' has been translated into at least a dozen languages including French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Gujarati, Chinese and Arabic.\n\nHis sphere of influence was evident when in January, more than 241 global leaders, including over 125 Nobel Laureates and former US President Barack Obama, had expressed their concerns via an open letter to Hasina over Yunus' \"continuous judicial harassment and potential jailing.\"\n\nWith the regime change, it remains to be seen what will be the fate of over 150 other cases, including the major corruption charges that Yunus faces. Earlier, those could have seen him jailed for years if found guilty while the economist has denied all the wrongdoing.\n\nIn June this year, Yunus was interviewed by Bonikbarta.net when he was asked about the growing Western pressure on democracy and human rights in Bangladesh.\n\n\"What people from the West want is not a consideration for me. What we have to consider is whether we want democracy, human rights and an independent press. ... Why should we let them impose their will on us?\" he said.\n\n\"Every country will frame its foreign policy on the basis of its own rules. We have to be clear on what we want. Establishing human rights and a free press are important for us,\" he added.\n\nTwo months later, he landed in Hasina's shoes, albeit as a caretaker for now.\n\nWhen one clicks on Yunus' own website, the very first quote of the Nobel laureate that greets you is, \"If you imagine, Some day it will happen. If you don't imagine, It will never happen.\"\n\nFor a person who had dreamed of a poverty-free Bangladesh, Yunus perhaps, may have never imagined that one day he would be heading his country.",

No mention was made at the ceremony of how long the interim government will be in power.\n\nBangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin, whose role is largely symbolic, administered the oath to Yunus and the others at the presidential palace in Dhaka.\n\n\"I will uphold, support and protect the constitution and will perform my duties sincerely,\" Yunus said as part of his oath.\n\nYunus now has the title of chief advisor and leads a body of 16 who comprise the rest of the interim administration.\n\nTaking the oath alongside Yunus were more than a dozen individuals from diverse fields, including two university students who became familiar faces to Bangladeshis in recent days.\n\nThe Dhaka University students, Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, were key figures in student protests that turned deadly and became a mass movement demanding Hasina step down.\n\nThe interim government also includes human rights activists, legal experts, two ex-diplomats, a doctor and a former governor of Bangladesh's central bank. A BenarNews reporter at the scene did not see anyone from Hasina's Awami League party.\n\nThe swearing-in ceremony, which began around 8 p.m. was attended by judges, NGO leaders, chiefs of the three branches of the military, the country's new police chief, foreign diplomats and leaders of political parties.\n\nYunus won the Nobel for lifting millions out of poverty by lending them small amounts of cash - microloans - to open small businesses. His microlending model has been replicated in more than 100 countries - though he was reviled by Hasina and, according to supporters, subjected to judicial harassment during her administration.\n\nA student in Dhaka, Salma Akhter, of Tejgaon College, was excited at the prospect of Yunus heading the new government.\n\n\"He is a reputed person. What we need is a visionary leader who will not amass wealth through corrupt practices. And will not involve him in corrupt practices,\" she told BenarNews.\n\n\"We hope the government will carry out institutional reforms and restore democratic institutions before holding national elections.\"\n\nYunus had been in Paris when it was announced that he had been selected to lead the interim administration and arrived back home just hours before the oath-taking ceremony, on Thursday afternoon.\n\nHe was welcomed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport by the Army chief Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman, some student leaders and civil society representatives.\n\nUpon landing, he alluded to the fact that Hasina had bent state institutions to her will, including security agencies. But he urged people not to take the law into their own hands.\n\n\"Restoring the law and order situation is our first job. We cannot take further steps until the law and order situation returns to normalcy,\" Yunus said.\n\nMore than 108 people have been killed in new violence since Hasina decamped on Monday, after weeks of civil unrest in which some 300 died.\n\nBangladeshis needed to regain faith in independent state institutions - faith they had lost during the 15 years of Hasina's continuous rule, Yunus said Wednesday.\n\n\"It is critical that trust in government be restored quickly,\" Yunus said in a statement, according to U.K.'s Financial Times.\n\n\"We need calm, we need a road map to new elections, and we need to get to work to prepare for new leadership in order to fulfill the extraordinary potential of Bangladesh.\"\n\nGreeting those who had come to receive him, Yunus was visibly emotional when students approached to shake his hand. With tears in his eyes, he ignored their outstretched hands and embraced them instead.\n\nBangladesh has an opportunity to start afresh thanks to the country's university students, he said at the airport on Thursday.\n\n\"Today is a glorious day for us . . . they [the students] protected and gave this country a rebirth,\" Yunus said after he landed.\n\n\"We have to protect it,\" he added.\n\nFollowing Hasina's resignation, the Students Movement Against Discrimination group proposed that Yunus lead the interim government, a choice South Asia observers viewed approvingly because the Nobel laureate is respected at home and abroad.\n\nThe group's students led the initial protests that turned deadly when security forces and Awami League supporters joined the fray in an attempt to disperse them. The violence angered people nationwide and the agitation became a mass movement demanding Hasina's resignation.\n\nBenarNews spoke to some newly appointed interim government members about what they believe should be the administration's first priority.\n\nAmong the issues mentioned by Saleh Uddin Ahmed, a former governor of the country's central bank, was the economy.\n\n\"The first step will be bringing back law and order, reactivating the slow economy, working for the people's welfare, and resuming the academic environment,\" he told BenarNews.\n\nReferring to the lives lost in recent weeks, human rights activist Adilur Rahman Khan said there needed to be accountability.\n\n\"We took this responsibility by standing in blood. We need to ensure justice, we need to bring public traitors to justice,\" he said.\n\n15 years\n\nAsif Mahmud, one of the two students named advisor on Thursday, said the interim government would \"reform\" state institutions, hold a free and fair general election and hand over power to an elected government.\n\n\"But that will not be possible without reforms to institutions such as the Election Commission,\" he told journalists after the oath-taking ceremony outside the presidential palace.\n\nHolding fair elections \"will not be possible without its reform,\" Asif said.\n\nAccording to the country's constitution, an election must be held within 90 days of parliament being dissolved. That happened on Tuesday, Aug. 6, which means the interim government's term ought to end early November\n\nBut one retired United States diplomat told BenarNews this week that may be unrealistic - that is, too short.\n\nHasina and her Awami League party had caused too much damage over her 15 consecutive years in power, said Jon Danilowicz, who has served three assignments in Bangladesh.\n\n\"I don't think we can say at this point how long the country will take to be ready for an election. Considering the degree to which the Awami League politicized the administration, security forces and judiciary, the task of unraveling all that will be very difficult and take very long,\" he said.\n\n\"But without doing that, it will not be possible to hold free, fair and credible elections.\"", "source": {"uri": "benarnews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "BenarNews"}, "authors":

Ever since the quota protest escalated into a full-fledged fight against the Sheikh Hasina-led government, the country has been witnessing multiple incidents of arson, looting, and mob attacks, and the Hindus have also been subjected to them.\n\nLashing out at the grand old party over maintaining silence over these attacks against the Hindus, Thakur jabbed the party asking, \"What was the compulsion that they could not speak about the security of Hindus and minorities there? They spoke a lot about Gaza but not about this.\"\n\nHe began his address, expressing concern about the ongoing unrest in Bangladesh and stated how Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted to congratulate Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus on taking oath as the head of the interim government of Bangladesh on Thursday.\n\nThakur then went on to highlight that the PM also stressed that the neighbouring country must ensure the safety and protection of Hindus and other minority communities amidst the prevailing unrest. However, Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge did not mention anything about the Hindus and minorities in their message when they congratulated Yunus on assuming office, he said.\n\n\"...We are all concerned with what has recently happened in our neighbouring country, Bangladesh. All political parties, in one voice, have said that we should be concerned about our people who are there. PM Modi tweeted and congratulated the PM of the Interim Government but he also said that peace, security and development of Hindus and minorities there should be ensured. But unfortunately, when the LoP and the Congress chief tweeted and congratulated him, they did not mention anything about Hindus there,\" Thakur stated.\n\n\"They did not mention anything about security of minorities. What was the compulsion that they could not speak about the security of the Hindus and minorities there? They spoke a lot about Gaza but you do not speak about it,\" the BJP MP added.\n\nBangladesh's interim government was formed on Thursday as Muhammad Yunus and his 16-member adviosry council were sworn in at 'Bangabhaban' by President Mohammed Shahabuddin. This development took place three days after former PM Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign and flee Bangladesh, following massive protests that turned violent.\n\nAs Yunus took the reigns of Bangladesh, PM Modi had extended his \"best wishes\" to him in a post on X, saying \"My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development.\"\n\nLeader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi had also congratulated Yunus saying, \"Congratulations to Professor Muhammad Yunus on being sworn in as the head of Bangladesh's interim government. A swift restoration of peace and normalcy is the need of the hour.\"\n\nCongress president Kharge, hoping for peace in Bangladesh, wished Yunus saying, \"On the behalf of the Indian National Congress, I extend our good wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on being sworn in as the head of Bangladesh's interim government.\"\n\n\"We sincerely hope that normalcy and peace returns in Bangladesh, our neighbour, with whom we Indians share a historic relationship. We pray for the safety of all the Bangladeshi people, including all the minorities,\" he posted on X.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anurag_Thakur", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anurag Thakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangabhaban", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangabhaban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/08/09/14d18ee7b704278a5cd6768776245cbe1723207809651927_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801989", "eventUri": "eng-9801989", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 89, "textEnd": 97}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

As with past topplings of tyrants in countries like Romania and Iraq, the seeds of future crises are already emerging from the shadows amid public rejoicing and recriminations.\n\nWith students directing traffic in Dhaka, Yunus appealed for calm and the protection of minorities after days of violence, looting and arson that included attacks on homes and monuments associated with Hasina's Awami League, Hindus, and others.\n\nFor the 84-year-old micro-lending pioneer, returning to Bangladesh as the interim government's chief adviser -- in effect prime minister -- is surely sweet vindication. Though Yunus is celebrated abroad, Hasina's government had pursued a legal vendetta against him and his operations, slandering him as a \"bloodsucker\" of the poor. In January, a labour court sentenced him to six months in prison in what his supporters called a trumped-up case -- one that has been dropped after Hasina's overthrow.\n\nYunus likened this week's events to \"a second liberation\", referring to Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971.\n\nHis comeback is remarkable in a year when US President Joe Biden, three years his junior, has been shunted aside in the race for the White House because of his advanced age and declining performance.\n\n\"No one can think of a better person to contain the situation, to restore law and order, and regain the trust of people in the government than Dr Yunus,\" says Tasneem Zaman Labeeb, 22, a student protester from Dhaka university's business school. \"Students are supporting him because we never really had a wise or intelligent policymaker as our government head.\"\n\nThe fate of the world's eighth-most populous country is now being vested in the fragile vessel of its most famous citizen, watched by global policymakers who see Bangladesh as strategically vital in a tense Indo-Pacific.\n\n\"I find it fitting that the young students who did this second liberation of Bangladesh are now the ones calling on him,\" says Saskia Bruysten, a friend and co-founder of Yunus Social Business. \"This will be a superstrong combination: young people leading the way, and his old age and wisdom coming together.\"\n\nYunus was born in 1940 in Chittagong as the third of 14 children, five of whom died young. In his book Banker to the Poor, he credited his mother Sofia Khatun, whose concern for the poor \"helped me discover my destiny\". After winning a Fulbright scholarship and settling into teaching in Tennessee, he felt the pull home after the 1971 war.\n\nWhen famine struck Bangladesh in 1974, he began studying ways to help farmers, fixating on access to credit after noting that people's fate was being decided by pennies a day.\n\nYunus began building what was to become Grameen Bank (derived from the word gram, or village), starting with a micro-loan of $27 to 42 people, prioritising lending to women. By 2003 Grameen was working with 36,000 villages. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.\n\nIn 2007, Yunus formed his own party and was briefly touted as an interim leader. He soon abandoned the effort, but according to his supporters this aroused Hasina's ire.\n\nIn 2010, her government demanded an investigation after a Norwegian documentary alleged Yunus had misappropriated donors' money. A Norwegian government probe found no wrongdoing, but the following year he was ousted from Grameen's board on grounds of his age (70).\n\nThe Hasina-Yunus rivalry resurfaced in 2022-3 during nationwide political unrest.\n\nAs her government piled legal cases on Yunus and Grameen, he rallied his global network. In January, 242 world figures including Barack Obama, Ban Ki-moon, and Orhan Pamuk signed a letter to Hasina urging a legal review. Analysts say Yunus's international network could now be one of his greatest strengths as he seeks to stabilise a faltering economy.\n\nBut even with ample political capital, his to-do list -- restoring law and order, fixing the economy and reforming corrupted institutions is long, not least for a man in his 80s.\n\nHis allies insist he will rise to the occasion. \"Bangladesh is at a critical economic and political crisis and has become the epicentre of geopolitical interest,\" says Asif Nazrul, a law professor and member of Yunus's interim government. \"But nobody in Bangladesh is better placed than Dr Yunus to address the issues.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Other members of the interim government also took their oaths. Among them Adilur Rahman Khan, a prominent human rights activist who was imprisoned by the ousted regime, and two student leaders.\n\nEarlier, the entrepreneur and Nobel laureate had given an emotional speech to waiting reporters at Dhaka airport on his arrival in the country to take up his position.\n\nYunus said he hoped to restore calm and rebuild Bangladesh after the uprising that ended the 15-year, increasingly autocratic rule of the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nYunus landed at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal international airport on Thursday afternoon after a trip to France for medical treatment. He was welcomed by Bangladesh's military chief, Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman, who was flanked by leaders of the navy and air force. Some of the student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also there. They had proposed him as interim leader to President Shahabuddin, who is acting as chief executive under the constitution.\n\nSecurity was tight at the airport as Bangladesh continues to experience unrest after Hasina resigned and left the country on Monday. Shahabuddin will preside over the oath-taking ceremony on Thursday night, when Yunus is expected to announce his cabinet. In his speech, he addressed the people of Bangladesh as \"one big family\" and said the young protesters had given them a \"new birth\" but he condemned the last two days of violence directed against the country's religious minorities.\n\n\"My first word to you is to protect the country from disorder. Protect it from violence so we can follow the path our students have shown us,\" he said, before paying an emotional tribute to Abu Sayeed, a 25-year-old student who was shot dead by police during a protest in Rangpur on 16 July. Yunus fought back tears as he described Sayeed as \"an incredibly brave young man\".\n\nHasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, had vowed on Wednesday that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladesh's politics - a reversal from what he had said earlier on Monday, when he called the students \"very ungrateful\".\n\nYunus was named as interim leader after talks among military officials, civic leaders and the student activists who led the uprising against Hasina.\n\nZaman, the military chief, said in a televised address on Wednesday he expected Yunus to usher in a \"beautiful democratic\" process.\n\nYunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel peace prize for his work developing microcredit markets, told reporters in Paris: \"I'm looking forward to going back home and seeing what's happening there, and how we can organise ourselves to get out of the trouble that we are in.\"\n\nAsked when elections would be held, he put his hands up as if it were too early to say. \"I'll go and talk to them. I'm just fresh in this whole area,\" he said.\n\nA tribunal in Dhaka earlier on Wednesday acquitted Yunus in a labour law violation case involving a telecommunications company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.\n\nYunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who has called him a \"bloodsucker\" allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.\n\nIn the weeks since 15 July, more than 300 people have died in violence in Bangladesh. Rising tensions in the days surrounding Hasina's resignation created chaos, with police leaving their posts after being attacked. Dozens of officers were killed, prompting police to stop working. They threatened not to return unless their safety was ensured. The looting of firearms was also reported in local media.\n\nThe chaos began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favoured people with connections to Hasina's party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a broader challenge to Hasina's 15-year rule, which was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on her opponents.\n\nJoy, Hasina's son, said in a social media post on Wednesday that his family would return to politics and not give up after attacks on the Awami League party's leaders and members. Many saw Joy as Hasina's successor in Bangladesh's dynastic political culture.\n\nOn Monday, Joy had said Hasina would be retiring to spend time with her grandchildren . But in a video message posted on his Facebook page on Wednesday, he urged party activists to rise up. \"You are not alone. We are here. The family of Bangabandhu has not gone anywhere,\" he said.\n\nHasina's father, the independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, is fondly referred to in Bangladesh as Bangabandhu, which means \"friend of Bengal\".\n\nJoy said: \"If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League. The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh. The Awami League has not died ... It is not possible to eliminate the Awami League. We had said that our family would not engage in politics any more. However, given the attacks on our leaders and activists, we cannot give up.\"\n\nOvernight into Thursday, people across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighbourhoods amid reports of robberies. Loudspeakers in mosques were used to alert people that robberies were occurring, and students formed volunteer groups to protect temples and businesses as police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for those seeking help.\n\nMany, including in neighbouring India, fear more instability in the densely populated country of 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the US.\n\nHasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, in an election boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the vote, and the US and UK denounced the result as not credible.", "source": {"uri": "southasiajournal.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "South

Modi congratulated Muhammad Yunus, who was sworn in as the country's interim leader after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country on being ousted on Monday.\n\nYunus, 84, a Nobel Peace Prize winner known for his banking initiatives to help the poor, was chosen to head the interim government. A longtime opponent of Hasina, one of his key tasks will be to restore peace in the nation and prepare for elections to form a new government.\n\nRead more: Nobel winner Yunus returns to Bangladesh to lead new government\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy,\" Modi said on X (formerly Twitter). He added that he hoped for the \"safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities.\"\n\nThe PM's appeal follows reports of attacks on the Hindu community in the crisis-hit nation. On Thursday, India's foreign ministry confirmed that it is \"monitoring\" the situation.\n\nAt present, Hindus make up about 9% of the Bangladeshi population.\n\nIndia has largely remained silent on the protests, in which around 300 people have been killed, last month describing the unrest as an \"internal matter.\"\n\nYunus recently said that he was disheartened by India's stance regarding the protests in his country. \"If there is a fire in the brother's house, how can I say it is an internal affair?\" he told The Indian Express earlier this week. Yunus blamed an \"absence of democracy\" for the unfolding crisis.\n\nRead more: Trump to do interview with Elon Musk on Monday\n\nThe Bangladesh Hindu, Buddhist, Christian Unity Council (BHCUC) said that around 200 to 300 Hindu homes had been vandalised after Hasina's ouster, according to Reuters.\n\nIndia's foreign ministry announced on Thursday that it is up to Hasina to \"take things forward\" regarding her future plans. According to reports, the ousted leader has been sheltering at an air base near New Delhi. She had earlier sought refuge in the UK, but her request is not likely to be granted. She is considering seeking asylum in a few other countries, including Russia, according to media reports.\n\nMeanwhile, members of Hasina's team, who fled to India along with the former prime minister, have left for undisclosed destinations abroad, India Today TV reported on Thursday, citing unnamed sources.", "source": {"uri": "globalvillagespace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global Village Space"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@globalvillagespace.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buddhism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.globalvillagespace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GUIC4-uXcAEDaqu-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801989", "eventUri": "eng-9801989", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

However, the festivities were marred by violence, with protesters carrying out revenge attacks on Hasina's allies, storming parliament and setting fire to multiple buildings, including television stations.\n\nBangladesh has a long history of political upheaval and coups.\n\nIn 2007, the military staged a coup after widespread political unrest and backed a caretaker government that ruled the country for two years until Hasina took power.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_pike@globalsecurity.org", "name": "John Pike", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figurehead", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Figurehead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801989", "eventUri": "eng-9801989", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

office, 84-year-old Dr Yunus began the tough challenge of returning the country to democracy.\n\nMs Hasina, 76, accused of widespread human rights abuses including the jailing of her political opponents, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India on Aug 5 as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her 15-year rule.\n\nThe military announced her resignation, then agreed to student demands that Dr Yunus - who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering micro financing work - lead an interim government.\n\nDr Yunus, who has taken the title of \"chief advisor\" to a caretaker administration, comprised of fellow civilians bar one retired brigadier-general, has said he wants to hold elections \"within a few months\".\n\nWhen polls might take place is not clear.\n\nOfficials of Ms Hasina's former ruling party, the Awami League, have gone into hiding after revenge attacks saw some of their offices torched, while former opposition groups such as the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are rebuilding after years of crushing repression.\n\nThe new administration faces a daunting task.\n\nThe veteran economist has called for the restoration of order in the South Asian nation after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\nIn driving rain, Dr Yunus stood silently on Aug 9 alongside student and civil society leaders in the new \"advisory\" Cabinet tasked with steering democratic reforms.\n\nTogether the group laid a wreath in the red-and-green colours of the national flag at the main memorial commemorating the millions who died in Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.\n\nDr Yunus suggested on his arrival on Aug 8 in Dhaka that Ms Hasina's ouster was as significant as the conflict that brought Bangladesh into being.\n\n\"Bangladesh has created a new victory day,\" he told reporters. \"Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"\n\nSeveral of Dr Yunus' advisers are loosely affiliated with the BNP, led by Ms Hasina's longtime rival and former premier Khaleda Zia, 78, newly released from years of house

Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"\n\nYunus called for the restoration of order after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\n\"Law and order is our first task. We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation,\" he said.\n\n\"My call to the people is if you have trust in me, then make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country. Every person is our brother. Our task is to protect them,\" Yunus said, adding that \"the whole of Bangladesh is one big family,\" Yunus added.\n\nMore than a dozen members of his cabinet, who are titled advisers, not ministers, also took the oath.\n\nThey included top leaders of the Students Against Discrimination group that led the weeks-long protests, Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud.\n\nOthers included a former foreign secretary and a former attorney general, an environmental lawyer, and prominent rights activist Adilur Rahman Khan who was sentenced to two years in jail during Hasina's rule.\n\nHasina, accused of widespread human rights abuses including jailing of political opponents, was forced to flee to neighbouring India on Monday as masses of protesters flooded Dhaka's streets.\n\nThe military then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.\n\nYunus choked with emotion on Thursday as he recalled the killing of student activist Abu Sayeed, shot dead in July by police from close range.\n\nHe paid tribute to the youth who sparked the protest movement and those who risked all for their desire for change.\n\n\"They protected the nation and gave it a new life\", he said.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his \"best wishes\" to Yunus on Thursday, saying New Delhi was \"committed\" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.\n\nDuring Hasina's reign, Yunus was hit with more than 100 criminal cases and a smear campaign by a state-led Islamic agency that accused him of promoting homosexuality.\n\nYunus had travelled abroad this year while on bail after being sentenced to six months in jail on a charge condemned as politically motivated, and which a Dhaka court on Wednesday acquitted him of.\n\nArmy chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said Wednesday he supported Yunus.\n\n\"I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process,\" Waker said.\n\nFew other details about the planned government have been released, including the role of the military.\n\nBut Bangladeshis voiced hope as they joined a rally in Dhaka on Wednesday for the former opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP).\n\n\"I expect that a national government will be formed with everyone's consent in a beautiful way,\" Moynul Islam Pintu told AFP.\n\n\"I expect that the country is run in a nice way, and the police force is reformed so that they can't harass people.\"\n\nMonday's events were the culmination of more than a month of unrest, which began as protests against a quota plan for government jobs but morphed into an anti-Hasina movement.\n\n\"The protests are a seismic moment in Bangladesh history,\" said International Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean.\n\n\"The country really had been at risk of becoming a one party state, and through a peaceful street-based movement led by Gen Z students in their 20s, they've managed to force her from power.\"\n\nThe military's switching of allegiance was the decisive factor in her ouster.\n\nIt has since acceded to a range of demands from the student leaders.\n\nThe president dissolved parliament on Tuesday, a key demand of the students and the BNP.\n\nThe head of the police force, which protesters have blamed for leading Hasina's crackdown, was sacked on Tuesday.\n\nThe new chief, Mainul Islam, offered an apology on Wednesday for the conduct of officers and vowed a \"fair and impartial investigation\" into the killings of \"students, common people and the police\".\n\nEx-prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, 78, was also released from years of house arrest, while some political prisoners were freed.\n\nThe military has demoted some generals seen as close to Hasina and sacked Ziaul Ahsan, a commander of the feared Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors":

India's foreign ministry said it had no update on Hasina's travel plans and it was up to her to \"take things forward\".\n\nThe neighbours have longstanding cultural and business ties and New Delhi played a key role in the 1971 war with Pakistan which led to the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Yunus and said New Delhi was committed to working with Dhaka to fulfil the \"shared aspirations\" of the people of both countries for \"peace, security and development\".\n\n\"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" he said.\n\nThe student-led movement that ousted Hasina grew out of protests against quotas in government jobs that spiralled in July, provoking a violent crackdown that drew global criticism, though the government denied using excessive force.\n\nThe protests were fuelled also by harsh economic conditions and political repression. The COVID-19 pandemic damaged the $450 billion economy after years of strong growth, leading to high inflation, unemployment and shrinking reserves.\n\nIt pushed the Hasina government to seek a $4.7 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.\n\n(Reporting by Ruma Paul and Sudipto Ganguly; Additional reporting by Krishna Das, Tanvi Mehta, Sakshi Dayal and Shounak Dasgupta; Writing by

Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"\n\nYunus called for the restoration of order after weeks of violence that left at least 455 people dead, calling on citizens to guard each other, including minorities who came under attack.\n\n\"Law and order is our first task... We cannot take a step forward unless we fix the law and order situation,\" he said.\n\n\"My call to the people is if you have trust in me, then make sure there will be no attacks against anyone, anywhere in the country.\"\n\n\"Every person is our brother... our task is to protect them,\" Yunus said, adding that \"the whole of Bangladesh is one big family\".\n\nMore than a dozen members of his cabinet, who are titled advisers, not ministers, also took the oath.\n\nThey included top leaders of the Students Against Discrimination group that led the weeks-long protests, Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud.\n\nOthers included a former foreign secretary and a former attorney general, an environmental lawyer, and prominent rights activist Adilur Rahman Khan who was sentenced to two years in jail during Hasina's rule.\n\nHasina, accused of widespread human rights abuses including jailing of political opponents, was forced to flee to neighbouring India on Monday as masses of protesters flooded Dhaka's streets.\n\nThe military then agreed to student demands that Yunus -- who won the Nobel in 2006 for his pioneering microfinancing work -- lead an interim government.\n\nYunus choked with emotion on Thursday as he recalled the killing of student activist Abu Sayeed, shot dead in July by police from close range.\n\nHe paid tribute to the youth who sparked the protest movement and those who risked all for their desire for change.\n\n\"They protected the nation and gave it a new life\", he said.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his \"best wishes\" to Yunus on Thursday, saying New Delhi was \"committed\" to working with neighbouring Dhaka.\n\n'Beautiful democratic process'\n\nBangladeshis voiced hope as they joined a rally in Dhaka on Wednesday for the former opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP).\n\n\"I expect that a national government will be formed with everyone's consent in a beautiful way,\" Moynul Islam Pintu told AFP.\n\n\"I expect that the country is run in a nice way, and the police force is reformed so that they can't harass people.\"\n\nMonday's events were the culmination of more than a month of unrest, which began as protests against a quota plan for government jobs but morphed into an anti-Hasina movement.\n\n\"The protests are a seismic moment in Bangladesh history,\" said International Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean.\n\n\"The country really had been at risk of becoming a one party state, and through a peaceful street-based movement led by Gen Z students in their 20s, they've managed to force her from power.\"\n\nMilitary move\n\nThe military's switching of allegiance was the decisive factor in her ouster. It has since acceded to a range of demands from the student leaders.\n\nThe president dissolved parliament on Tuesday, a key demand of the students and the BNP.\n\nThe head of the police force, which protesters have blamed for leading Hasina's crackdown, was sacked on Tuesday.\n\nThe new chief, Mainul Islam, offered an apology on Wednesday for the conduct of officers and vowed a \"fair and impartial investigation\" into the killings of \"students, common people and the police\".\n\nEx-prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, 78, was also released from years of house arrest, while some political prisoners were freed.\n\nThe military has demoted some generals seen as close to Hasina and sacked Ziaul Ahsan, a commander of the feared Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force.",

He said that it remains to be seen how the interim government governs the nation.\n\n\"There is no law and order in Bangladesh. Looting and robbery are going on, the army is deployed in Dhaka so some areas are peaceful, but in others, looting continues in neighbourhoods. Dr Yunus is talking about second independence; well, let's see if he can restore law and order in the country. We shall see how capable he is\", said Hasina's son.\n\nNobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, who recently returned to Bangladesh to lead the interim government, paid tribute to those killed in the deadly protests that led to Sheikh Hasina's ousting. Yunus stated that the sacrifices of those killed in the protests had brought the nation a \"second independence.\"\n\n\"Today is a glorious day for us,\" he said shortly after returning to the country to lead a caretaker government. \"Bangladesh has created a new victory day. Bangladesh has got a second independence.\"\n\nSajeeb further noted that he is 'convinced' Pakistan's ISI was involved in fuelling political unrest in Bangladesh.\n\n\"Once the protesters started agitating for the ouster of the government, they started attacking the police stations. The people attacking the police stations were armed with guns, and it is very difficult to obtain guns in Bangladesh. They were supplied by someone and the only actors capable of supplying weapons to countries are the foreign intelligence service\", he said.\n\nNobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took oath as the head of the interim government of Bangladesh on Thursday night. The new caretaker government, led by its Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus, was sworn in by President Mohammed Shahabuddin. The development came three days after Sheikh Hasina was ousted as the Bangladesh Prime Minister following violent protests in the country.\n\nSajeeb told ETV Bharat that his mother is in good spirits now but was initially disappointed as she didn't expect this to happen. \"She is deciding what to do next. Our first priority is to ensure the safety and security of our people\", he said.\n\nSajeeb claimed that his mother has not applied for asylum anywhere and has not made any decision, adding, \"What she was really planning was to ultimately go back to Bangladesh, once democracy is restored. Whether she will be active in politics or not is irrelevant but her goal was this was going to be her last term and she would go live in her village home retired\".", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajeeb_Wazed", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sajeeb Wazed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inter-Services Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Adviser_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief Adviser of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://etvbharatimages.akamaized.net/etvbharat/prod-images/09-08-2024/1200-675-22162116-99-22162116-1723171266265.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801989", "eventUri": "eng-9801989", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

No representatives of Hasina's party were present.\n\nSixteen other people have been included in the interim Cabinet with members drawn mainly from civil society and including two of the student protest leaders. The Cabinet members were chosen in discussions this week among student leaders, civil society representatives and the military.\n\nHasina quit Monday after several chaotic weeks that began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina's party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasina's 15-year rule, as more than 300 people including students were killed amid spiraling violence.\n\nYunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in the French capital for the 2024 Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role, and returned home earlier Thursday to tight security at the airport in Dhaka.\n\nIn his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. \"Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,\" Yunus said, flanked by student leaders. \"It has immense possibility.\"\n\nThe president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration.\n\nHasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy has vowed that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladesh's politics.\n\nYunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a \"bloodsucker,\" alleging he used force to extract loan repayments from rural poor people, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations.\n\nThe chaos on Bangladesh's streets continued. Overnight into Thursday, residents across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighborhoods amid reports of robberies. Police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for people seeking help.\n\nThe unrest began in mid-July with protests over the quota system, but grew into a broader challenge over an administration marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on opponents.\n\nMany fear that Hasina's departure could trigger even more instability in the densely populated nation of some 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States.\n\nHasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, in an election boycotted by her main opponents.

We wanted a civilian government that will bring genuine reforms,\" Namlah told Al Jazeera on Friday.\n\n\"And we are relieved to see that that happened quickly.\"\n\nThree days after Hasina quit, Muhammad Yunus, the South Asian country's only Nobel laureate, was sworn in as the \"chief adviser\" of a caretaker government tasked to bring peace and democracy, both of which Hasina's critics said were undermined during her 15 years of \"autocratic\" rule.\n\nThe chief adviser of the caretaker government holds the rank of the prime minister while members of the advisory council are granted the status of ministers.\n\nAs the new administration takes over in Dhaka, many are wondering whether it will be able to take the country of 170 million people out of what one of the members of the new government called a \"dark era\".\n\n\"The army chief had promised an interim government, but until it was officially established, uncertainty remained due to widespread speculation,\" Saifullah Sajib, an employee at a travel agency in Dhaka, told Al Jazeera as he watched a live telecast of Yusuf and his 16-member cabinet taking their oaths of office at the presidential palace.\n\nThe protests in Bangladesh that began last month were led mainly by tens of thousands of university students opposed to a quota system for government jobs that they alleged favoured those close to Hasina's Awami League party.\n\nThe primarily peaceful demonstrators were attacked by both the security forces as well as supporters of Hasina's party, resulting in nearly 300 deaths and transforming the protests into a larger call for Hasina to quit.\n\nHours after she resigned and fled to neighbouring India in a military aircraft, the Students Against Discrimination, an umbrella group of student movements that led the protests, proposed 84-year-old Yunus as the head of an interim government.\n\nYunus, an economist and banker, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his efforts to bring millions of people out of poverty through microloans. He is also a longtime critic of Hasina and hailed the success of the student-led protests as a \"second independence day\" for Bangladesh.\n\n\"I feel so relieved to see Dr Yunus sworn in as the head of the interim government,\" Abdullah Al Mamun, a businessman in the garments industry, told Al Jazeera. \"I hope that someone with his credentials will be able to guide the country through this crisis.\"\n\nAfter his swearing-in on Thursday night, Yunus told reporters as he was flanked by student leaders: \"Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it. It has immense possibility.\"\n\nHe said his government's \"foremost promise is to ensure that everyone can enjoy the fresh air of freedom\".\n\n\"We must ensure that the benefits of this freedom extend to every citizen. Otherwise, it would be meaningless. Therefore, we commit to bringing freedom to every home,\" he said, adding that those who committed wrongdoing during Hasina's tenure \"will be held accountable\".\n\nAnalysts said one of Yunus's main challenges will be to ensure law and order after days of chaos that saw attacks on the houses of Awami League politicians, sporadic attacks on temples and homes of minority Hindus who were considered close to the ousted Hasina, and a general absence of policing, manifested by students this week managing traffic on the busy streets of Dhaka.\n\nAcknowledging the disorder, Asif Nazrul, professor of law at Dhaka University and member of Yunus's interim government tasked with running the Ministry of Law and Justice, said it is grappling with multiple challenges due to the unprecedented situation in the country.\n\n\"Under [Hasina's] autocratic rule, it was a dark era, and the people's profound anger against the regime led to this eruption. However, we can no longer support such outbursts as they have exceeded acceptable limits,\" he said.\n\nThe interim government is a mix of both experience and youth and includes rights activists, professors, lawyers, former government officials and other prominent members of Bangladesh's civil society.\n\nBut it is the surprise inclusion of two 26-year-old student leaders who spearheaded the recent movement against Hasina that is likely to be a talking point in the coming days.\n\nNahid Islam, a student of sociology at Dhaka University, has been given the telecommunications portfolio while Asif Mahmud, a student of linguistics at the same university, will look after sports.\n\n\"If Bangladesh is led by its youth, the country will stay true to its goals,\" Islam said on Thursday.\n\nMahmud said he was ready for the challenges ahead. \"The state institutions were devastated under [Hasina's] fascist regime. Our goal is to eradicate fascism by reforming these institutions,\" he said.\n\nFormer army officer M Sakhawat Hossain has been given the Ministry of Home Affairs. He used to be close to Hasina's Awami League but supported the student protests against her government.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has been given to Saleh Uddin Ahmed, who governed the central bank during the 2001-2006 rule of the opposition Bangladeshi Nationalist Party (BNP). Former diplomat and columnist Touhid Hossain will look after foreign affairs.\n\nOther notable figures in the new government are climate change minister Syeda Rizwana Hasan, a winner of the Ramon Magsaysay Award - often referred to as Asia's Nobel Prize - for her environmental work; rights activist Adilur Rahman Khan, who will handle industries; electoral reforms activist Sharmeen Murshid, charged with the Ministry of Social Welfare; and women's rights activist and advocate for biodiversity-based ecological agriculture Farida Akhter, who will run the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock.\n\nThe other members of the cabinet are former Attorney General Hasan Ariff (local government affairs), Yunus's longtime associate Nurjahan Begum (health) and Muslim leader and academic Khalid Hossain (religious matters).\n\nThe portfolios of the remaining three members - psychiatrist Bidhan Ranjan Roy from the minority Hindu community, former diplomat Supradip Chakma from the Indigenous Chakma community, based in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and independence fighter Faruk-e-Azam - have not been declared.\n\nMichael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program and senior associate for South Asia at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in the United States, told Al Jazeera that \"on paper\", the interim government with its \"wide array of leaders from all walks of life looks remarkably diverse\".\n\n\"But how everything fits together and whether a consensus is possible is unclear. This is where Yunus's leadership will be essential,\" he said.\n\nOne of the biggest allegations against Hasina's long rule was her abuse of the security apparatus, mainly the police and a paramilitary force, which she used against political adversaries and is also accused of using to manipulate elections to help her hang on to power.\n\nMost recently, the police were employed against the antigovernment protesters in clashes that killed dozens of people as police officers fired live ammunition on demonstrators, intensifying the people's anger against them.\n\nSince Hasina's fall, an absence of law enforcement officials on the streets have seen people set up nighttime patrols to protect their neighbourhoods and the property of vulnerable minorities, mainly Hindus.\n\nAfter taking his oath, Yunus told reporters those \"instigating anarchy\" will face the \"full force of law enforcement\" and made assurances that \"both the triumphant students and the public will work together to ensure their failure\".\n\nKhan, who now runs the Ministry of Industries, said the most complex task before the new administration will be to \"dismantle the remnants of Hasina's autocratic rule\".\n\n\"This will involve making new appointments across nearly all positions in various departments and divisions, including law enforcement, the judiciary and different ministries,\" he said.\n\nHe said the new government will investigate all instances of human rights violations that occurred during Hasina's tenure. \"Upholding human rights will be a primary focus of the interim government,\" he said.\n\nAli Riaz, distinguished professor of politics and government at Illinois State University in the US, told Al Jazeera the interim government \"possesses both strengths and weaknesses, as is typical with any group\", and said he hoped more people will be brought into the government as it begins its work and assesses its needs.\n\nHe said having younger individuals, especially students, in the cabinet was a positive development. \"They should be able to reflect the perspectives of the younger generation and may offer innovative approaches and challenge traditional methods of governance,\" he said.\n\nRiaz identified three immediate challenges before the interim government. The first is to establish a clear direction for the future. People have differing expectations, and some may demand immediate elections while others may call for structural reforms, he said.\n\nThe second challenge, he said, is the economy. He said the government should implement \"measures that benefit the general public\" and demonstrate that \"this government is distinct from its predecessors\".\n\nAnd the third challenge, Riaz said, is to reassess Bangladesh's relationships with regional and global powers. \"Over the past 15 years, these relationships, especially with India, had been shaped in ways that may have been detrimental to the country's national interests,\" he said.\n\nMany in Bangladesh fear Hasina's close ties with New Delhi may force the new administration to take an anti-India stance, which analysts said could be detrimental to improving the economy.\n\nJournalist and commentator Shayan S Khan told Al Jazeera the primary mandate of the interim government will \"clearly be to conduct free and fair elections\". He said conducting polls should be a relatively straightforward task for a nonpartisan interim government with no vested interests.\n\n\"However, the circumstances of the Awami League's departure might require additional time for it to regroup and prepare for the election, which could pose a challenge for the interim government. Without the Awami League, the election could lack a certain level of credibility,\" he added.\n\nKugelman, on the other hand, anticipated a long haul for the interim government and even the emergence of a new party, \"perhaps led by Yunus and the protest leaders\".\n\nThe main opposition BNP wants immediate elections, which Kugelman said could be a spoiler in the coming days. \"The key question is how the BNP, by virtue of its size and clout as the biggest beneficiary of Hasina's ouster, adjusts to a new reality that won't necessarily defer to the BNP's power,\" he said.\n\nBNP politician Amir Khashru Mahmud Chowdhury said that while the interim government faces the \"tough task of building the country from the ruins of the Awami League's massive corruption, systematic destruction of the judiciary and bureaucracy\", it should also think about elections.\n\n\"I think the people would definitely prefer to exercise their democratic rights of voting, which in the Awami era was not possible,\" Chowdhury told Al Jazeera. \"So I would urge the government to give people the scope of exercising their democratic rights.\"\n\nBut there is also a lack of clarity among experts over whether an interim government must hold elections within 90 days of taking charge.\n\nSupreme Court lawyer Shahdeen Malik told Al Jazeera an \"extraordinary government\" has been formed in Bangladesh under \"extraordinary circumstances\".\n\n\"It is called an interim government, or some even call it a caretaker government with Dr Yunus as its chief adviser, but the fact is there is no provision in our constitution for the formation of such a government after the 15th Amendment [to the constitution], which removed the provision for such a government,\" he said.\n\nIn June 2011, during her first of four consecutive terms, Hasina's government introduced the 15th Amendment to prevent any \"unelected government\" from assuming power. The move followed a Supreme Court ruling that had declared a caretaker government formed by the military from 2006 to 2008 was illegal because it remained in office for more than two years without calling elections within the mandated 90 days.\n\nMalik said that since there is no longer a constitutional provision, the interim government under Yunus is not obliged to hold elections within 90 days. He added, however, that the functioning of the new government could be legalised by making another amendment to the constitution.\n\n\"General Ziaur Rahman did that through the Fifth Amendment, and General Hussain Mohammad Ershad did that through the Seventh Amendment. So this government will likely do the same,\" Malik concluded.\n\nBadiul Alam Majumder of Citizens for Good Governance, a civil society group campaigning for political reforms, told Al Jazeera the Awami League's unilateral passage of the 15th Amendment in a \"majoritarian fashion effectively weaponised\" the constitution and undermined the political establishment.\n\nHe demanded the abolition of the caretaker government system, which he said had led to three \"failed\" elections in the country, in 2014, 2018 and 2024. He also called for amendments instead to include provisions that ensure free and fair elections in a \"deeply divided and fractured country\".", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news",

He, however, did not follow through on that plan.\n\nBy a quirk of fate, on Thursday he took oath to lead a non-partisan, non-military caretaker government.\n\nYunus, who started as a Professor at national and international Universities, earned the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize and the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1984 among scores of other international recognitions.\n\nBut back home, the founder of the Grameen Bank had been in a protracted row with Hasina's government due to obscure reasons while authorities initiated a series of investigations against him after she came to power in 2008.\n\nBangladesh authorities launched a review of the Grameen Bank's activities in 2011 and fired Yunus as its founding managing director on charges of violating the government retirement regulation.\n\nOver the years, he was charged under dozens of cases. In January, a court sentenced Yunus to six months in jail on charges of labour law violation.\n\nOn June 10 this year, a Dhaka court prosecuted Yunus and 13 others - currently out on bail - for embezzling as it rejected a plea for the dismissal of charges by the accused.\n\nThe prosecution accused Yunus and the others of embezzling Taka 250 million (about USD 2 million) from the workers welfare fund of Grameen Telecom, which owns a 34.2 per cent stake in Bangladesh's largest mobile phone operator, Grameenphone, a subsidiary of Norway's telecom giant Telenor.\n\n\"She destroyed the legacy of her father Bangabandhu Mujibur Rahman. Bangladesh is liberated... We are a free country now,\" Yunus told an Indian portal on Monday from Paris after news broke out of Hasina fleeing the country amid civil unrest.\n\nNotwithstanding the Hasina government's stand, Yunus continued to receive international accolades as was evident by the speech by Susanna B Afan, president of the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation, on June 27 this year at Manila.\n\nAfan stated that the work by Yunus, globally recognised as 'The Father of Microfinance' has not just inspired similar projects in the Philippines, Indonesia and Pakistan but their respective founders too received the Ramon Magsaysay Award.\n\nBorn in pre-Independence India in 1940 in Chittagong, Yunus first studied at Dhaka University in Bangladesh, which was then East Pakistan; went as a Fulbright scholar to study economics at Vanderbilt University in the US and obtained PhD in economics in 1969.\n\nThe very next year, he became an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University in the US but returned to Bangladesh to head the economics department at Chittagong University.\n\nEarlier, in 1984, Yunus was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership for \"his pioneering efforts in enabling rural men and women to become economically self-sufficient through sound group-managed credit.\" The 2006 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for his work in poverty alleviation and the empowerment of poor women through Grameen Bank where Yunus has \"successfully melded capitalism with social responsibility\" through the microcredit institution.\n\nApart from multiple national awards, Professor Yunus is the recipient of numerous international awards for his ideas and endeavours from countries including Sri Lanka, USA, Jordan, Sweden, Japan, The Netherlands, and South Korea.\n\nPublished on January 1, 1991, his autobiography, 'Banker to the Poor: Microlending and the Battle Against World Poverty,' has been translated into at least a dozen languages including French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Gujarati, Chinese and Arabic.\n\nHis sphere of influence was evident when in January, more than 241 global leaders, including over 125 Nobel Laureates and former US President Barack Obama, had expressed their concerns via an open letter to Hasina over Yunus' \"continuous judicial harassment and potential jailing.\" With the regime change, it remains to be seen what will be the fate of over 150 other cases, including the major corruption charges that Yunus faces. Earlier, those could have seen him jailed for years if found guilty while the economist has denied all the wrongdoing.\n\nIn June this year, Yunus was interviewed by Bonikbarta.net when he was asked about the growing Western pressure on democracy and human rights in Bangladesh.\n\n\"What people from the West want is not a consideration for me. What we have to consider is whether we want democracy, human rights and an independent press. ... Why should we let them impose their will on us?\" he said.\n\n\"Every country will frame its foreign policy on the basis of its own rules. We have to be clear on what we want. Establishing human rights and a free press are important for us,\" he added.\n\nTwo months later, he landed in Hasina's shoes, albeit as a caretaker for now.\n\nWhen one clicks on Yunus' own website, the very first quote of the Nobel laureate that greets you is, \"If you imagine, Some day it will happen. If you don't imagine, It will never happen.\" For a person who had dreamed of a poverty-free Bangladesh, Yunus perhaps, may have never imagined that one day he would be heading his country.

Prof Yunus - lauded for his pioneering use of micro-loans - was one of those who found themselves in legal trouble during her tenure.\n\nMs Hasina regarded him as a public enemy - he is currently on bail, appealing against a six-month jail term in what he has called a politically-motivated case.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday, he called on the country's young people to help him rebuild the South Asian country.\n\n\"Bangladesh can be a beautiful country, but we destroyed the possibilities,\" he said.\n\n\"Now we have to build a seedbed again - the new seedbed will be built by them,\" he added, gesticulating towards the students who had arrived to greet him.\n\nHis ascension as Bangladesh's interim leader follows weeks of turmoil.\n\nMore than 400 people are reported to have died after protests seeking to abolish a quota system for civil service jobs began in July.\n\nA third of these jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans from Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan, which took place in 1971. Campaigners argued the system was discriminatory and needed to be overhauled.\n\nThough this demand was largely met after the Supreme Court backed the students' demands and vastly reduced the scale of the quota system, the protests then transformed into a wider anti-government movement fuelled by crackdowns.\n\nBangladeshi media and demonstrators blamed police for the spiralling death toll. Officials maintained that officers only ever opened fire out of self-defence or to protect state property.\n\nStudents and their supporters had planned to march on the prime minister's residence on Monday.\n\nBut before the march could get properly moving, the news came that Sheikh Hasina had fled Bangladesh and resigned as prime minister.

This perhaps is the right time and opportunity for him to do so\n\nNew Delhi: Things in Bangladesh have been topsy-turvy to say the least, after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation and her escape into India. This took place after major student protests over government job quotas, putting the government into the most severe phase of turbulence since its formation in 1971 following a brutal Liberation War.\n\nAfter Hasina exit, the student protesters proposed Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus to be the chief adviser for the suggested interim government, which he later accepted.\n\n\"We have decided that internationally renowned Nobel laureate Dr Muhammad Yunus will be appointed as the chief advisor in the interim government, and we have also spoken with Dr Muhammad Yunus. He has agreed to take on this significant responsibility in response to the call of the students and public to safeguard Bangladesh,\" said Nahid Islam, a key coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement which spearheaded the protests.\n\nOther Nobel laureate leaders\n\nEconomist Muhammad Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, then arrived in Dhaka and was sworn in as the head of Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday evening.\n\nMuhammad Yunus will now serve as chief adviser, equivalent to prime minister, of an interim Cabinet of 16 members. The Cabinet was selected through discussions among student leaders, civil society, and the military earlier this week.\n\nYunus, however, will not be the first Nobel laureate who subsequent to being awarded the prize would lead their country. Five others have done this before him.\n\nA Fulbright economics student who received his Ph.D from Vanderbilt University in 1969, Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for founding the Grameen Bank and pioneering the concepts of microcredit and microfinance. He has received many other major national and international honours also, like the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010.\n\nBefore Yunus, some others have also been Nobel laureates who later led their countries, the two most prominent among them being Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi and South Africa's Nelson Mandela.\n\nAnother example can be given of Canada's Lester B Pearson who was the country's prime minister from 1963 to 1968. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957, for his role in resolving the Suez Crisis and in his time as the Canadian prime minister introduced a national pension plan, a family assistance program and laid the groundwork for universal healthcare in Canada.\n\nLikewise, Poland's president from 1990 to 1995, Lech Walesa won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 \"for non-violent struggle for free trade unions and human rights in Poland\" and later led the country being the first since 1926 to be democratically elected in Poland.\n\nJose Ramos Horta who is currently the president of East Timor, an island just north of Australia, since 2022 is another such example. He previously held the position from 2007 to 2012, and the prime ministership from 2006 to 2007. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 for working \"towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor\".\n\nThe two most famous examples nonetheless remain to be Aung San Suu Kyi and Nelson Mandela.\n\nAung San Suu Kyi served as the State Counsellor of Myanmar from 2016 to 2021 after leading Myanmar's transition from military rule to partial democracy. She had won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 \"for her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights\" in Myanmar.\n\nFor her role in Myanmar's revolutionary political uprisings and her house arrests, she became one of the world's most prominent political prisoners and symbol of democracy. She later saw massive condemnation when ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people took place in Myanmar's Rakhine state. She is serving a 27 year prison sentence on various graft charges.\n\nThe biggest example perhaps is Nelson Mandela who served as the president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. The first Black president of South Africa who won when the country held its first ever multi-racial elections, he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, jointly with then President Frederik Willem de Klerk, \"for their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa\".\n\nThe precedent before Muhammad Yunus is clear and now time will tell how he deals with leading the country in one of the most tumultuous periods in its history.\n\nWhat can his tenure look like\n\nFirst, Yunus needs to transition the country from one of the most violent protests in its recent history to a calmer period before he implements reforms.\n\nReviving law and order and then paving the way for free and fair elections would be key.\n\nIt is only after he completes these basic, but tasks of utmost importance, can he look to implement the economic theories that made him a Nobel Prize winner.\n\nMuhammad Yunus established the Grameen Bank in 1983 on the belief that \"credit is a fundamental human right\". It was done with the objective of helping poor people escape poverty by providing them suitable loans.\n\nThis concept paved the way to the revolutionary micro-lending concepts which could again be implemented in the currently unstable country of Bangladesh.\n\nWith the aim of changing the political culture of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus announced plans to set up his own \"Citizen Power\" but was unable to implement his vision due to political and military instability. This perhaps is the right time and opportunity for him to do so. The precedent set by other Nobel laureates who did commendable work for their countries once they came into power may be of huge help for him.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news",

Prof Yunus - lauded for his pioneering use of micro-loans - was one of those who found themselves in legal trouble during her tenure.\n\nMs Hasina regarded him as a public enemy - he is currently on bail, appealing against a six-month jail term in what he has called a politically-motivated case.\n\nOn Thursday, he called on the country's young people to help him rebuild the South Asian nation.\n\n\"Bangladesh can be a beautiful country, but we destroyed the possibilities,\" he said.\n\n\"Now we have to build a seedbed again - they will build the new seedbed,\" he added, gesturing towards the students who had arrived to greet him.\n\nProtests began as peaceful demands to abolish quotas in civil service jobs. More than 400 people are reported to have died after protests seeking to repeal the quota system for civil service jobs began in July.\n\nA third of these jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans from Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan, which took place in 1971. Campaigners argued the system was discriminatory and needed to be overhauled.\n\nThough this demand was met mainly after the Supreme Court backed the students' needs and vastly reduced the scale of the quota system, the protests then transformed into a broader anti-government movement fueled by crackdowns.\n\nBangladeshi media and demonstrators blamed the police for the spiralling death toll. Officials maintained that officers only opened fire for self-defence or to protect state property.\n\nStudents and their supporters had planned to march on the prime minister's residence on Monday.\n\nBut before the march could properly move, the news came that Sheikh Hasina had fled Bangladesh and resigned as prime minister.

The ruthlessness of the government's security forces - which have used live ammunition against protesters and killed over 400 of them - has shocked the nation.\n\nYunus has been brought in as interim leader following talks among military officials, civic leaders and the student activists who led the uprising against Hasina.\n\nHe will usher in a \"beautiful democratic\" process, after years of autocratic rule, declared General Waker-Uz-Zaman, the country's military chief, in a televised address to the nation yesterday.\n\nIs Yunus up to the task?\n\nNicknamed \"banker to the poor\", he is lauded for his pioneering use of micro-loans, credited with helping to lift millions of Bangladeshis out of poverty, particularly women.\n\nHe is a longtime critic of Hasina and is currently on bail, appealing against a six-month jail term in what he labels a politically-motivated case.\n\nAs Yunus was sworn in as head of the interim government today, the ceremony began with a minute's silence to remember those who were killed in the recent protests. Among the attendees was Adilur Rahman Khan, one of Bangladesh's most prominent human rights activists, who was imprisoned by the ousted regime for exposing the government's role in enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.\n\nDespite these encouraging first signs of change ahead, Yunus will face manifold challenges.\n\nAn immediate one will be to re-establish law and order after the unrest of recent weeks. Even last night, many residents of Dhaka were carrying sharp weapons to guard their neighbourhoods, as loudspeakers from the mosques warned of multiple robberies taking place.\n\nAnother major challenge will be to repair the deep mistrust that the people of Bangladesh feel towards the country's police, judiciary, and other state-run institutes. Police, for instance, have allegedly destroyed hospital death registers to hide the true death toll from recent demonstrations.\n\nYunus will face pressure, especially from students involved in the movement to oust Hasina, to set up some sort of judicial procedure to hold authorities accountable for the excessive violence used against protesters, and to ensure justice for the hundreds who have lost their lives.\n\nThere are big economic challenges to contend with too. Even before the political unrest, the economic situation in Bangladesh was worsening. In May, the country's reserves of foreign currency fell below US$19 billion (\u00a315 billion) for the first time in 11 months.\n\nOn top of that, Yunus will have to keep a watchful eye on Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy. In Bangladesh's dynastic political culture, many saw Joy as Hasina's natural successor. \"The family of Bangabandhu has not gone anywhere,\" insisted Joy, in a video message posted on his Facebook page yesterday.\n\nThe Students Against Discrimination group, that led Bangladesh's anti-government protests told CNN today: \"We are very delighted to say that Dr. Yunus has agreed to accept this challenge to save Bangladesh as per our students' request.\" No pressure.", "source": {"uri": "reaction.life", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reaction"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Seventeen years later the Nobel laureate recognised for his work in micro-finance, especially the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, now heads the interim government in his country after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stepped down and ignominiously fled the strife-torn nation. Yunus has his tasks cut out for him, from quelling the violence in the short term to bringing back a sense of stability in the following weeks to ensuring that free and fair elections are held in the long term.\n\nYunus was the choice of the students' groups which have led the agitation in the country for months now against what they allege were stage-managed elections in January, which returned Hasina to power, and her autocratic ways and structures. Her shoot-at-sight orders to defence and police forces leading to hundreds to deaths of protestors have opened deep wounds for many in a nation that had seen violent uprisings and similar deaths in 1970-71, when it was still East Pakistan, immediately before it was liberated with help from India. Yunus termed this time as \"second independence\" when he touched down at Dhaka from Paris. The Hasina government had filed more than 100 criminal cases against him and he was out on bail after being sentenced to six months in jail; he termed the charges as politically motivated. He was cleared of them today.\n\nYunus commands great respect and regard among academicians and social sector advocacy activists around the world. His pioneering work has helped him form international connections too. Yunus faces a tough task but is in the best position to influence his country's trajectory. As the face of Bangladesh's interim government, he will be called upon to leverage his best qualities such as academic wisdom, patience and ability to work through challenges. He will look to his friends and supporters outside Bangladesh to boost his efforts.

On his arrival in Dhaka, shortly after 2 pm on Thursday, August 8, surrounded by students and supporters, the 84-year-old economist and head of the interim government spoke of a \"glorious day.\" Barely 72 hours earlier, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina had fled the country under pressure from the crowds on the street, after 15 years of a reign that had become increasingly autocratic. \"Bangladesh has got a second independence,\" declared the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner, thereby, like many of his compatriots, comparing the hated leader's departure to the war of liberation waged against Pakistan in 1971.\n\nYunus, who had flown in from Paris, was sworn in later that evening at the Bangabhaban, the official residence of the Bangladeshi president. As \"chief adviser\" to the caretaker government - the official title, as he is in an interim position - he has been tasked with leading a democratic process aimed at elections. \"I will uphold, support and protect the Constitution,\" he solemnly declared, adding that he would carry out his duties \"with sincerity.\"\n\nSome Bangladeshis had gathered in front of their televisions to follow the ceremony broadcast live, others had their eyes glued to their phone screens. \"This is a very good thing, Sheikh Hasina was a bad leader for the country and Muhammad Yunus has done a lot for the poor,\" rejoiced Tonmoy (who did not give his last name), a 26-year-old Bangladeshi man, in Dhaka. \"We extend our heartiest welcome to the interim government that begins its journey during an extraordinary time in our history,\" wrote the Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star, in its editorial on Friday.\n\nRestoring law and order\n\nThe presence of Yunus at the head of the government has been greeted with optimism. It raises hopes in a country battered by the brutal repression of student protests. More than 400 people have died since July 1 during the movement that led to Hasina's downfall on Monday. Fueled by a thirst for revenge, the violence continued after the ousted prime minister left office, targeting members of her Awami League party in particular.

He pioneered giving small loans to the poor to help them escape poverty.\n\nHis work in microfinance is widely acknowledged and has been adopted by many countries around the world.\n\nHe was born in Chittagong in 1940 and studied at Dhaka University. He completed his PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) in economics from Vanderbilt University in the United States (US).\n\nReportedly, he returned to Bangladesh in 1972, after the 1971 liberation war, and began teaching economics at Chittagong University. He soon started lending money to those in need out of his own pocket when Bangladesh suffered from a famine in 1974.\n\nThis initial lending laid the foundation for the Grameen Bank, which he founded in 1983, with the bank reportedly lending $6 billion towards microenterprises, with a special focus on women.\n\nAlthough much-celebrated in the global community, especially in Western academic and government circles, he has a checkered history with Hasina and has been a long-time critic of the Awami League government's policies.\n\nHe has been accused of links with the US deep state. Wikileaks cables that, in 2007, Yunus asked the then US ambassador's help to impress upon Bangladesh's caretaker government to change a law that gave it authority over his Grameen Bank.\n\nHe was subsequently shunted out of his post as managing director of Grameen Bank in 2011, citing that he had crossed the retirement age, using this law.\n\nYunus was slapped with multiple cases, including a defamation suit, a food safety case, and a tax fraud case, which he and his supporters claimed to be vendetta politics, a charge Hasina repeatedly denied. He was also sentenced to six months in prison for labour law violations.\n\nHe is also believed to have been interested in joining politics, as by Wikileaks cables, and was said to be reviewing multiple options.\n\nHe is, therefore, suspected to be very close to the US government.\n\nAfter his oath-taking ceremony, a statement released by the US said that the US government hoped that the new interim government in Bangladesh would chart a new democratic future for the people of the country.\n\nHow Yunus will be able to restore peace and protect minorities like Hindus and Christians against

It is only fitting that his homeland, Bangladesh, is now looking for him to lead the way forward.\"\n\nYunus has been awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom and the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal. He was also awarded Vanderbilt's Nichols-Chancellor's Medal-a recognition of persons who define the 21st century and exemplify the best qualities of the human spirit-in 2007, along with a $100,000 prize.\n\nAs is tradition for Nichols-Chancellor's Medalists, Yunus delivered the keynote speech at a ceremony for the graduating class the day before Commencement in 2007. In his speech, Yunus reflected on his seven years at Vanderbilt and the significant role the university played in his life. He credits that time with helping him build the courage to return home to Bangladesh in 1972-a move that would eventually lead to his development of the micro-lending model that helped address poverty and famine in Bangladesh. \"Vanderbilt has made me bold, made me dare,\" Yunus said. \"Without that, I wouldn't have been able to do the things I did when I left.\"\n\nWatch Muhammad Yunus deliver the 2007 Senior Day address. /Public Release.

Yunus returned to his native country on Thursday, Aug. 8, after weeks of student-led protests. He met with Shahabuddin and army chief Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman before taking his oath. Sixteen other people have been appointed to the interim Cabinet, including civilian members and two of the student protest leaders.\n\nYunus, 84, was born in the Chittagong District of Bangladesh, and he studied at Dhaka University before moving on to a career teaching economics at Chittagong University from 1961 to 1965. He later received a Fulbright Scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt, and he earned his doctorate in economics there in 1971. He taught at Middle Tennessee State University before returning to Bangladesh in 1972 to become the chairman of the Department of Economics at Chittagong University. There, he developed the concept of banking for the poor and launched Grameen Bank, an internationally recognized model for combating poverty through micro-lending.\n\n\"We in the Vanderbilt community are incredibly proud of Dr. Muhammad Yunus. He is not only a first-rate economist, but also a highly compassionate individual who has dedicated his entrepreneurial talents to doing work that has made a major difference in the lives of people across the developing world,\" said Kamal Saggi, chair of the Department of Economics at Vanderbilt. \"By founding Grameen Bank and launching the microcredit revolution in finance, he has shown the world how financial innovation can promote economic development. It is only fitting that his homeland, Bangladesh, is now looking for him to lead the way forward.\"\n\nYunus has been awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom and the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal. He was also awarded Vanderbilt's Nichols-Chancellor's Medal -- a recognition of persons who define the 21st century and exemplify the best qualities of the human spirit -- in 2007, along with a $100,000 prize.\n\nAs is tradition for Nichols-Chancellor's Medalists, Yunus delivered the keynote speech at a ceremony for the graduating class the day before Commencement in 2007. In his speech, Yunus reflected on his seven years at Vanderbilt and the significant role the university played in his life. He credits that time with helping him build the courage to return home to Bangladesh in 1972 -- a move that would eventually lead to his development of the micro-lending model that helped address poverty and famine in Bangladesh. \"Vanderbilt has made me bold, made me dare,\" Yunus said. \"Without that, I wouldn't have been able to do the things I did when I left.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.vanderbilt.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanderbilt University"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chittagong", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Chittagong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong_District", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chittagong District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chittagong District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Dhaka", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Dhaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microcredit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grameen Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulbright_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulbright Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Tennessee_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle Tennessee State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Gold_Medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Gold Medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidential Medal of Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-news/files/20190417232648/Professor-Muhammad-Yunus-2-581x585.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801989", "eventUri": "eng-9801989", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 202, "textEnd": 208}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

However, she was forced to resign and flee the country on Monday after the military turned against her and refused to continue to supress the protests.\n\nThe oath-taking ceremony, led by President Mohammed Shahabuddin, was attended by over 1,500 politicians, students, protest coordinators and representatives from the military and civil society. Other members of the interim government also took their oaths. Among them Adilur Rahman Khan, a prominent human rights activist who was imprisoned by the ousted regime, and two student leaders.\n\nYunus' caretaker government has crucial challenges ahead, as it has to establish law and order, revive the economy, and pave the way for free and fair elections.\n\nThe Muslim-majority country's political turmoil has seen a rise in attacks against religious minorities, especially Hindus, who are the second largest religious community in Bangladesh and viewed as supporters of Hasina's secular Awami League.\n\nAccording to the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, a forum of minorities, since August 4 hooligans targeted at least ten Hindu temples and hundreds of houses and properties of religious minorities.\n\nBesides Hindus, the Ahmadiyya Muslim sect, considered heretics by Muslim hardliners, has also come under attack.\n\nNirmol Rozario, leader of the council and also president of Bangladesh Christian Association confirmed to UCA News agency that, in the present circumstances, Christians and other minority groups feel insecure.\n\nBishop Gervas Rozario of Rajshahi, vice-president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Bangladesh, told UCA News that authorities \"must take immediate measures to stop the violence and destruction.\" \"All need to remain calm and exercise restraint at this critical moment,\" Rozario said.\n\nThe latest census in 2023 found that 90 percent of the total population of 170 million in Bangladesh are Muslims, with Hindus still making up the largest minority group at 8 percent, while Christians represent less than 1% , including 0,3 per cent of Catholics.", "source": {"uri": "vaticannews.va", "dataType": "news", "title": "vaticannews.va"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Who are other aged world leaders?", "body": "Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus smiles as he arrives to appear before a labour court in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The 84-year-old took oath as head of Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday (8 August). AP\n\nMuhammad Yunus took oath as chief advisor of Bangladesh's caretaker government on Thursday (8 August), four days after Sheikh Hasina fled the country following anti-government demonstrations. The new leader is 84, older than US president Joe Biden.\n\nThe 81-year-old American leader's age has been in the spotlight recently. Questions were raised about his physical and mental fitness, so much so that he was forced to withdraw from the presidential race.\n\nBut how old is too old in politics? How prevalent is gerontocracy, where a government is ruled by leaders significantly older than most of the country's adult population? We take a look.\n\nPaul Biya\n\nPaul Biya, the president of Cameroon is the oldest political leader to be governing any nation in the world. The 91-year-old has been at the helm of the Central African country, since November 6, 1982. Before this, he had also served as the prime minister from 1975 to 1982.\n\nBiya began his political journey under President Ahmadou Ahidjo taking on various responsibilities. Even after allegations of voting irregularities, he has been re-elected multiple times with his tenure witnessing political reforms and the introduction of multiparty politics in the early 1990s.\n\nRetirement does not seem to be on the Cameroonian leader's mind. He is expected to run for office in the 2025 presidential election.\n\nKing Salman\n\nAt 88, King Salman of Saudi Arabia is regarded as the custodian of tradition and proponent of cautious reform. He was born on December 31, 1935, and ascended the throne in 2015. His reign has been marked with measures to modernise the nation and reflects his understanding of the kingdom's role in a rapidly changing world. He is now ailing and has stepped back from most public duties.\n\nIn 2017, King Salman named Mohammed bin Salman as crown prince. MBS, as he is popularly known, has been effectively running the country since.\n\nMuhammad Yunus\n\nNobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took the oath of office as head of Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday (August 8). The 84-year-old is one of the oldest leaders in the world. And he has a task at hand - to restore peace in Bangladesh and prepare for new elections.\n\nYunus is a household name in the country. After the Liberation War, he headed the economics department at Chittagong University. Witnessing the Bangladesh famine of 1974, one of the worst of the 20th century, the professor was inspired to work towards poverty reduction.\n\nHe launched the Grameen Bank in 1983 to benefit the poor. The success of the model inspired similar projects in 100 different countries. In 2006, Yunus received a Nobel Prize in economics for Grameen Banks' contribution to social and economic development.\n\nHowever, he ran into trouble with Hasina in 2008, when her administration launched a series of investigations into him. She accused Yunus of using force and other means to recover loans from poor rural women as the head of Grameen Bank; allegations he denied.\n\nEarlier this year, a special judge's court in Bangladesh indicted Yunus and 13 others on charges over the $2 million embezzlement case. However, after the fall of Hasina, a Bangladeshi court on Wednesday overturned the conviction.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nUS President Joe Biden recently announced his decision to not contest the US presidential elections slated to take place in November. His age had a role to play.\n\nIn 2021, when he assumed the presidency at the age of 78, he was the oldest person ever to hold the office in the US. By 2028, when the next US presidential election will be held, he would be 85, if he contested.\n\nBiden has had a long-standing career, where he focused on domestic policy, climate change and international relations. Before being elected president, he had served as the vice president under Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017.\n\nHowever, when Biden started running for a second term his age became a growing concern. His many gaffes did not help. The final straw was the disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump. Weeks later, Biden decided to exit the race.\n\nNarendra Modi\n\nIndia's Narendra Modi who won his third term in June is 73. He has had a long and illustrious career.\n\nIn his early years, PM Modi was a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He has been involved in politics since the 1970s, but his career gained significant momentum in the late 1990s. He became Gujarat's chief minister in 2001 and served for 14 years. He was elected as prime minister in 2014 and continues to be popular.\n\nHowever, ahead of this year's election, his age was in the spotlight as opposition leaders spoke of a \"BJP rule\" which did not allow anyone in the party to hold a post beyond 75. In 2017, then-BJP president Amit Shah said that it was his party's decision not to give Lok Sabha poll tickets to those above 75. However, in May this year, Shah clarified that there was no such provision in the party's constitution.\n\nShehbaz Sharif\n\nPakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is a year younger than his Indian counterpart. The 72-year-old started his second term as PM in February, returning to the role he had until August 2023 when the country's parliament was dissolved ahead of elections.\n\nSharif was picked by his party and coalition allies despite his elder brother and three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif being a favourite.\n\nShehbaz is known for his work in infrastructure development. He has been an important figure in Pakistani politics for decades, serving as the chief minister of Punjab from 1988 to 1990 and again from 2013 to 2018.\n\nVladimir Putin\n\nBorn on October 7, 1952, Vladimir Putin has been a central figure in Russian politics for over two decades.\n\nIn May 2024, the 71-year-old was sworn in as Russia's president for a record sixth term. During Putin's first inauguration ceremony in May 2000, he had pledged to \"preserve and develop democracy\" and to \"take care of Russia\".\n\nHowever, 24 years later, Russia has invaded Ukraine. And democracy in the country is questionable. Putin has curbed rights, jailed critics, and done away with all checks and balances on his power, reports the BBC.\n\nBut as he ages and there is speculation about his health, a question mark remains on Russia's political future.\n\nXi Jinping\n\nMuch like Russia's Putin, China's Xi Jinping seems to have cemented his position on top. The 71-year-old was awarded a third five-year term as the nation's president in March 2023, putting him on track to stay in power for life at a time of severe economic challenges and rising tensions with the US, Taiwan and others.\n\nXi had himself named to a third five-year term as party general secretary in October 2022, breaking with a tradition under which Chinese leaders handed over power once a decade. A two-term limit on the figurehead presidency was deleted from the Chinese constitution earlier, prompting suggestions he might never step down.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType":

AP\n\nAfter the storm, comes the calm. And that's what Bangladesh -- which has seen violence and protests, leading to the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina -- is hoping from Muhammad Yunus as he takes the oath as the head of the interim government.\n\nKnown as the 'banker of the poor', 84-year-old Yunus, who also holds the honour of being the 2006 Nobel Peace winner, will aim to bring stability to the southeast Asian nation, which has been wracked by student anger.\n\nYunus being sworn in as head of the interim government comes after his name was first proposed for the top job by the coordinators of the student movement that led to Hasina's ouster. But the question that many are asking is if 84-year-old Yunus is up for the challenge.\n\nScholar and academic\n\nBorn in 1940 in Chattogram, a seaport city in Bangladesh, Yunus was one of nine children in a family of merchants. At 25, he travelled to the United States to study under a Fulbright scholarship, received his PhD from Vanderbilt University in the United States and taught there briefly before returning to Bangladesh in 1971 -- the same year the country won its independence from Pakistan in a brutal, bloody war.\n\nOn his return, he was elected to head Chittagong University's economics department, and soon became passionately involved with combatting the famine that ravaged Bangladesh in the mid-70s.\n\n\"I became involved in the poverty issue not as a policymaker or a researcher,\" he said in a 2005 lecture at the Commonwealth Institute in London. \"I became involved because poverty was all around me. \"I could not turn my eyes away from it... I wanted to do something immediate to help people around me.\"\n\nMicrocredit and the Grameen Bank\n\nIt was under these conditions -- the famine led to a high mortality rate in the country -- that Yunus noted that banks were not giving loans to victims of the famine if they did not have any collateral damage. He then lent a loan of $27 to 42 families with the belief that such loans would greatly contribute to stimulation of businesses thus improving the financial conditions of the poor.\n\nHe held the opinion that the poor were not fundamentally unworthy of credit, reasoning that the poor were lacking in resources but not in trustworthiness or financial sensibility. He believed they would be able and inclined to honour loans, if only given a reasonable interest rate. This belief lay at the heart of the Grameen Bank's business model.\n\nTaking this belief forward, in 1983, he launched the Grameen Bank with the aim of providing small loans to those who would not normally qualify to receive them. As the Madras Courier writes in one report, the Grameen Bank's philosophy of advancing credit was founded not on collateral but on the trust of the local community of borrowers.\n\nSpeaking on the same, Yunus once claimed that microcredits were both a human right and an effective means of emerging from poverty: \"Lend the poor money in amounts which suit them, teach them a few basic financial principles, and they generally manage on their own.\"\n\nThe Grameen Bank also adopted the model of solidarity group lending wherein a loan is divided among several recipients. Moreover, collective lending ensured that loans are being repaid on time.\n\nSuccess of Yunus' Grameen Bank\n\nThe Grameen Bank soon became a buzzword in Bangladesh. It also came up with the \"16 Decision\" -- which was later updated to \"18 Decisions\" -- in which borrowers vowed to follow certain codes on receiving a loan. For instance, a borrower vows to ensure the education of their children and follow a healthy lifestyle by drinking only tube well water.\n\nThe loans granted by Grameen Bank saw women becoming more empowered, primary school enrollments increasing, households maintaining better hygiene and sanitation and even infant mortality reducing.\n\nThe BBC notes that the Grameen Bank became so successful that even beggars had been able to borrow money under his scheme.\n\nIn 2006, the Nobel Peace Prize Committee also recognised the impact that Yunus' Grameen Bank had on Bangladeshi society and awarded him and the institute the prestigious award that year.\n\nToday, over 40 years since, the institute began, it has reached out to nearly 45 million people through its 10.6 million borrower members. Additionally, as of June 2024, it had disbursed loans worth $38 billion, maintaining a recovery rate of 96.3 per cent.\n\nHowever, despite its success, the Grameen Bank is not without criticism. There are some who have criticised the concept of micro-financial institutions, saying they charge exorbitant interest rates and use coercive debt collection methods. On this, Yunus' response has been that the Grameen Bank doesn't aim to earn money but to help the poor and empower small businesses.\n\nYunus' ouster from Grameen Bank\n\nInterestingly, as the Grameen Bank's reputation became stronger, it was Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina who fired Yunus as managing director saying that at 73, he had stayed on past the legal retirement age of 60.\n\nShe also accused the bank of \"sucking blood of the poor\" and claimed Yunus treated the institution as his \"personal property.\"\n\nInspiration for other institutions\n\nThe success of the Grameen Bank can also be gauged from the fact that several such micro-financing institutes (MFIs) have emerged across the world. The Centre for Development Policy and Practice notes that several MFIs have emerged in India. For instance, Bandhan in India was established in 2001 and started its operations in West Bengal as a non-profit organisation with the motive of providing women empowerment and financial inclusion. It became the largest microfinance institution in India by 2010 and it currently has more than 4,000 banking outlets and 1,000 branches across India.\n\nNow, the question is: Will Yunus be able to steer Bangladesh as he did with the Grameen Bank? Only time will tell. But as a quote on his website states: \"If you imagine, someday it will happen. If you don't imagine, it will never happen.\" May be it's time for him and the people of Bangladesh to imagine better days.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Will The Nobel Laureate Successfully Navigate Bangladesh's Political Shift?", "body": "US Hopes for Democratic Progress as Muhammad Yunus Takes Charge of Bangladesh's Interim Government\n\nOn the afternoon of September 8, 2024, Dhaka witnessed a momentous occasion as Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus arrived to assume the role of interim Prime Minister of Bangladesh. Yunus, renowned globally for his pioneering work in microfinance, will lead the country through a critical transitional phase following the resignation of long-standing Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nMuhammad Yunus's ascension to the role of interim Prime Minister marks a significant shift in Bangladeshi politics, as it ends Sheikh Hasina's 15-year tenure. Yunus, often celebrated as the 'Banker to the Poor,' was chosen to navigate the country through this pivotal period, a decision reached after an unprecedented student-led movement ignited national unrest and led to Hasina's resignation.\n\nMuhammad Yunus's journey from a small village in pre-independence Bengal to the global stage is a story of visionary leadership and unwavering dedication. Born in 1940 in Bathua, Yunus was the third of nine children in a merchant family. His early education in Chittagong, followed by further studies in the U.S., laid the foundation for his future endeavors.\n\nREAD MORE: Families Of Missing Baloch Persons To Hold Rally In Quetta To Highlight Pakistani Atrocities\n\nThe decision to appoint Yunus was influenced by a broad consensus among the military, opposition leaders, and student groups. As the country seeks stability, the spotlight is now on Yunus to manage the intricate balance between political factions and address pressing national concerns. His appointment comes at a time when fears of military intervention, minority rights violations, and potential chaos are at the forefront of public discourse.\n\nIn 1976, Yunus's visit to a rural village led him to the groundbreaking idea of microcredit -- small, non-traditional loans designed to empower the underprivileged. This concept materialized into Grameen Bank in 1983, which has since provided over $6 billion in loans to millions of borrowers. Yunus's innovative approach to poverty alleviation earned him the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2006, solidifying his place as a global advocate for social and economic development.\n\nOn a personal note, Yunus's life reflects a blend of professional achievement and personal commitment. He has a daughter, Monica Yunus, an opera singer in New York City, from his first marriage to Vera Forostenko. His second wife, Afrozi, a physicist and academic, shares two daughters with him. His family background, including his socially active siblings, highlights a legacy of dedication to societal betterment.\n\nDespite his accolades, Yunus's career has not been without controversy. In 2011, Grameen Bank faced scrutiny from Sheikh Hasina's government, leading to allegations of fund misuse. Yunus's attempt to challenge the decision legally was met with mixed results, and he faced multiple cases, some of which were criticized as politically motivated. These challenges underscore the turbulent intersection of politics and social activism in Bangladesh.\n\nAs Yunus embarks on his new role, the world watches with anticipation. His leadership is poised to influence Bangladesh's future trajectory significantly. Will his tenure mark a new era of stability and progress for the nation? Only time will tell, but Yunus's arrival heralds a hopeful chapter for a country in transition.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker_to_the_Poor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Banker to the Poor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microfinance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microcredit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grameen Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bengal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baloch_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baloch people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chittagong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chittagong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quetta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quetta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monica Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_reduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty reduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physicist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative_Political_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative Political Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mohammad-yunus-interim-PM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801989", "eventUri": "eng-9801989", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Yunus is known as the \"banker to the poor\" and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his work developing microloans that helped lift millions out of poverty. Yunus thanked Bangladeshi youth for giving the country a \"rebirth\" and vowed to work for the public good.\n\n\"This is uncharted territory,\" says Shahidul Alam, an acclaimed Bangladeshi photojournalist, author and social activist, who has spent decades documenting human rights abuses and political and social movements in the country. Alam was jailed in 2018 for his criticism of the government and spent 107 behind bars, during which time he says he was tortured by the authorities. \"This repression has taken such a toll on so many people for so long, the nation is just hugely relieved.\"\n\nWe also speak with Nusrat Chowdhury, an associate professor of anthropology at Amherst College and author of Paradoxes of the Popular: Crowd Politics in Bangladesh. She says it's very significant that student leaders are being brought into the new government and says Yunus is a rare public figure in Bangladesh who exists \"beyond party politics\" and has the chance to unify the country.", "source": {"uri": "democracynow.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democracy Now!"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahidul_Alam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shahidul Alam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microcredit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amherst_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amherst College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthropology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.democracynow.org/images/story/68/73268/full_hd/SEG1-Yunus-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801989", "eventUri": "eng-9801989", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

The event was attended by political leaders, civil society figures, military generals, and diplomats, and was set against the backdrop of continuing unrest in the country. Analysts say Yunus faces a challenging path ahead, as the nation may be on the brink of deeper political crisis.\n\nThe 17-member Cabinet, referred to as \"advisers,\" includes two key coordinators from the student-led movement, Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud, and prominent human rights defender Adilur Rahman Khan, previously imprisoned under Hasina's government for documenting rights violations.\n\nThe Cabinet also includes economists, NGO activists, academics, and a retired military officer. The planned duration of the interim government has not been announced.\n\nEarlier that day, arriving at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, the microfinance pioneer delivered an emotional speech to reporters as he prepared to take up his new duties. Yunus expressed his hope to restore peace and rebuild Bangladesh following the uprising that ended Hasina's 15-year, increasingly autocratic reign.\n\n\"Law and order have been disrupted; people are attacking each other, setting homes and property on fire, looting, and burning offices. They are attacking Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Ahmadis,\" Yunus told the reporters. The Ahmadis are a messianic Islamic movement that began in the 19th century.\n\n\"We must protect them and restore order, as violence and chaos are major enemies of progress,\" he added.\n\nPolitical analysts, however, say a major challenge will be governing with a Cabinet that, despite emerging from a \"mass revolution,\" lacks a democratically obtained mandate.\n\nPolitical crisis ahead?\n\nDhaka-based political analyst Zahed Ur Rahman expressed concerns that political parties, which have been sidelined from power for an extended period, may not provide the interim government with enough time to execute the \"nation-rebuilding\" envisioned by the new Cabinet.\n\nHe said that under Hasina's leadership, her Awami League political party had \"debilitated every state mechanism.\"\n\n\"From the police to the media, the bureaucracy is thoroughly corrupted; even the election commission is completely ineffective. Therefore, to restore effectiveness, the interim government will need to undertake extensive efforts, which will require a significant amount of time,\" Rahman told VOA.\n\nThe current crisis presents an opportunity to put Bangladesh back on the path of genuine democracy and move beyond the hyperpartisan, winner-take-all electoral dynamics that have caused so much damage over the past three decades, said Thomas Kean, International Crisis Group senior consultant.\n\n\"It needs to embark on the long task of rebuilding democracy in Bangladesh, which has been so badly eroded in recent years,\" Kean said in a statement.\n\nWhile political parties have welcomed the movement that ousted the Hasina regime and the appointment of Yunus as the head of the interim government, they appear reluctant to allow much time for this new administration to establish itself.\n\nMirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, a leading figure in Bangladesh's major political party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, told VOA, \"We fully support this government, which is endorsed by the country's youth and students who drove this change. I am very hopeful for their success. However, we expect that they will fulfill their constitutional duty to conduct a free and fair election within 90 days.\"\n\nAs the country shifted to the interim government, the BNP held a rally in Dhaka Wednesday. The rally was led by former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who was recently released from house arrest after receiving a presidential pardon and addressed the party activists in a prerecorded video message.\n\nThis action by BNP is perceived by many as an indication of impatience and a desperate bid for power. \"The wound from this movement is still fresh, and there is no government and law and order, how can you hold a rally under such condition? This impatience from them will send the country towards a deeper crisis in this crucial time,\" Rahman said.\n\nSkepticism on military's role\n\nIn Bangladesh, marked by a tumultuous history of military coups and countercoups, there is significant skepticism regarding the military's current role, which it claims is merely to steward the current political turmoil and oversee the transition of power.\n\n\"I don't trust the military to run this country,\" Hasan Robayet, a 38-year-old poet and civil society member, told VOA. \"We have seen the outcomes of past military rule. The military should not dictate terms to this government. This revolution was won by the students and the masses; they should hold full control of the government.\"\n\nThe military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a military-backed caretaker government for two years, following which Hasina and her Awami League secured a decisive victory in the elections.\n\nA general close to the army leadership told VOA that the current chief, Waker-Uz-Zaman, is not inclined to pursue a full military takeover. Instead, he aims to support the interim government from the sidelines, facilitating a smooth transition and the swift handover of power to a democratically elected government, the general said.\n\nBangladesh experienced military rule from 1975 to 1990, beginning with the assassination of its founding leader, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. This period included multiple coups, particularly starting in 1977 under General Ziaur Rahman, who shifted the nation from a single-party socialist state to a multiparty system, though the military retained significant influence.\n\nFollowing General Zia's assassination in 1981, General Hussain Muhammad Ershad assumed the presidency in 1983. The military regime in Bangladesh ended in 1990 following a massive public uprising for democratic reforms, led by opposition parties and a strong student movement that staged strikes and protests nationwide, and compelled Ershad to resign in December 1990.\n\nDespite all challenges, Nahid Islam, the coordinator of the movement and now an adviser in the interim government, has vowed to fulfill the promises made to the people during the mass uprising.\n\n\"We have come to government to fulfill the promises that led to this mass uprising, promises for which hundreds of our brothers and sisters were injured or killed. We are committed to fulfilling these promises as soon as possible,\" he told VOA after being sworn in.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"},

A school teacher was killed and dozens injured as communal attacks spread across Bangladesh. The international community, including the UN and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have called for peace and protection of minorities.\n\nHundreds of people protested in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on Friday against escalating violence targeting the country's minority Hindus after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country earlier this week. A school teacher was killed, and at least 45 people were injured as homes, businesses, and temples of Hindus were attacked in Muslim-majority Bangladesh following Hasina's resignation on Monday.\n\nProtesters carried posters demanding the protection of Bangladeshi minorities, chanting slogans like 'who are we, Bengali Bengali', and appealed for peace as they blocked an intersection in the capital. Hindus, who represent about 8% of Bangladesh's 170 million population, have traditionally supported Hasina's Awami League party, which faced public ire after violent clashes between anti-quota protesters and security forces last month.\n\nThe Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council reported that at least 52 of the country's 64 districts have been affected by communal violence since August 5 and called on Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist now leading a caretaker administration, for assistance.

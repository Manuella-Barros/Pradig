Beatty\n\nThe jury tasked with delivering a verdict in the trial of a murder-accused pilot are set to hear how police allege Russell Hill and Carol Clay were killed -- and the defence response to the allegations.\n\nGregory Stuart Lynn, 57, will return before the Victorian Supreme Court on Friday as prosecutors prepare to deliver their opening remarks.\n\nThe father-of-two, a former Jetstar captain, has pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder relating to the disappearance of Mr Hill, 74, and Ms Clay, 73, more than four years ago.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nThe pair vanished while camping in the remote Wonnangatta Valley, about five hours northeast of Melbourne in March 2020.\n\nA major search operation began after they were reported missing.\n\nOn Thursday, a jury of 14 Victorians was empaneled to hear the case over the next four to six weeks.\n\nProviding a brief summary of the allegations, the presiding judge, Justice Michael Croucher, said it was alleged Mr Lynn was camping at Bucks Camp alongside Mr Hill and Ms Clay on March 20.\n\n\"It will be alleged Mr Lynn shot Ms Clay in the head and as a result killed her and that he killed Mr Hill,\" he said.\"These events are alleged to have occurred on March 20, 2020.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Justice Croucher warned jurors there had been \"a lot of publicity\" since the pair vanished, urging anyone who had any knowledge of the case and felt they could not be impartial to ask to be excused.\n\n\"Trial by jury represents an important contribution to our justice system,\" he said.\n\n\"That system can't operate unless people are prepared to put their hands up and perform the solemn duty in an impartial way.\"\n\nScheduled to begin at 10.30am on Friday, the jury will hear opening arguments from Crown prosecutor Daniel Porceddu as he sets out the alleged case and the evidence he expects they will hear.\n\nThis will be followed by the defence response from Mr Lynn's barrister, Dermot Dann KC, who will highlight what he believes are the issues in the prosecution case and how the jury should interpret the evidence.\n\nThe trial continues.\n\nOriginally published as Gregory Lynn trial: Prosecution to lay out timeline of alleged Russell Hill and Carol Clay

captain, has pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder relating to the disappearance of Mr Hill, 74, and Ms Clay, 73, more than four years ago.\n\nThe pair vanished while camping in the remote Wonnangatta Valley, about five hours northeast of Melbourne in March 2020.\n\nA major search operation began after they were reported missing.\n\nOn Thursday, a jury of 14 Victorians was empaneled to hear the case over the next four to six weeks.\n\nProviding a brief summary of the allegations, the presiding judge, Justice Michael Croucher, said it was alleged Mr Lynn was camping at Bucks Camp alongside Mr Hill and Ms Clay on March 20.\n\n\"It will be alleged Mr Lynn shot Ms Clay in the head and as a result killed her and that he killed Mr Hill,\" he said.\"These events are alleged to have occurred on March 20, 2020.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Justice Croucher warned jurors there had been \"a lot of publicity\" since the pair vanished, urging anyone who had any knowledge of the case and felt they could not be impartial to ask to be excused.\n\n\"Trial by jury represents an important contribution to our justice system,\" he said.\n\n\"That system can't operate unless people are prepared to put their hands up and perform the solemn duty in an impartial way.\"\n\nScheduled to begin at 10.30am on Friday, the jury will hear opening arguments from Crown prosecutor Daniel Porceddu as he sets out the alleged case and the evidence he expects they will hear.\n\nThis will be followed by the defence response from Mr Lynn's barrister, Dermot Dann KC, who will highlight what he believes are the issues in the prosecution case and how the jury should interpret the evidence.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

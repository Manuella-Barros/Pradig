It was one of four field goals from Durant out of eight shots. Durant scored nine points and grabbed three rebounds.\n\nDurant got into it with some fans over rooting interests in the game Thursday night, after a Denver sports analyst ('Swipa' on X) showed support for Nikola Jokic of the Nuggets and his team, Serbia, which kept it close against a Team USA team he mentioned was favored by 16 points. Durant asked him where he was from in response:\n\nAfter the game, Durant had commented on playing for Team USA in the Olympics, and patriotism. \"A lot of (expletive) happens in our country,\" Durant said. \"But a lot of great things happen, too.\"\n\nLater in the X thread, Durant responded again. In the thread, Durant was accused of having a fragile ego as a result of his response to the Denver sports analyst. Somebody then pointed out that he believes Durant is \"just tired of American nugget fans cheering against team USA and cheering for Serbia.\"\n\nThe X user who accused Durant of having a fragile ego then said; \"Cheering against Team USA? You mean, like all of those Americans who were making fun of Noah Lyles not winning gold in his latest race? Good ol' double standards. Just admit you hate the fact that Jokic is clearly the best player in the world.\"\n\nJokic is a three-time NBA MVP. Durant made his thoughts clear.\n\n\"To all you nuggets fans, nobody gives a (expletive) who yall lames believe is the best player in the league, players got major respect for Jok, we don't worship him like yall do but most are in awe of his brilliance. Trolling you cornballs for rooting against us is apart of the game. Deal wit it,\" Durant tweeted.\n\nDurant's Twitter spree did not end there. He also sent a fiery response to an Australian fan who criticized American sports culture and said that Americans do not \"embrace the competition.\"\n\nAnother fan on X then responded to Durant, saying that fans are the ones who \"make the league how big it is.\" Durant's counter was to ask him why he watches basketball, implying that the players are the draw:\n\nAnother fan had responded to what Durant had to say to the Australian user, telling Durant that divisiveness between fans and players has always been around, but it seems Durant only sees it as a problem now when \"guys like Giannis and Jokic are getting the same treatment.\" Both are foreign-born players.\n\nDurant finished his X posts by repeatedly calling the fan a \"clown,\" saying the fan and fans like him have \"corny agendas\" and more:\n\nDurant has averaged 13.6 points per game and a steal per game in 20.6 minutes per contest in these 2024 Paris Olympics. He has shot 57.9% from the field and 61.1% from downtown. He is Team USA's leading scorer in their entire Olympic history.\n\nHe was spotted courtside with Team USA titan Carmelo Anthony, taking in the USA Women's game against Australia.

Maybe coach y'all up a little bit. I would definitely watch though. I wouldn't leave the gym.

Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nDurant's joy is always obvious when he's with Team USA.\n\nUSA Basketball, and the Olympics specifically, is a sanctuary for Durant. As his NBA career has been in flux from team to team to team, the Olympics have been a constant, a place where Durant can just hoop.\n\n\"There's a purity to the Olympic experience for these guys,\" U.S. men's 5x5 basketball coach Steve Kerr said. \"They're playing together. They're playing together with guys they're used to competing against, but the fact that it is such a brief competition allows all these guys to just commit to winning each game and commit to each other. And there's just not a lot of frankly NBA BS. It's just go out and play and win and they're all together.\"\n\n\u27a4 The USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news -- fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nDurant loves that and has embraced it.\n\nHe is trying to become the first American male to win four Olympic gold medals in basketball when the U.S. plays France on Saturday in the Olympic final.\n\nDurant is already the all-time leading scorer in U.S. Olympics history - male or female with 502 points and passed Lisa Leslie for the top spot at these Games - and has established himself as one of the all-time great Olympic players, surpassing what Carmelo Anthony did in the Olympics for the U.S.\n\n\"We love playing for our country and a lot of (BS) goes on in our country too,\" Durant said. \"But there's a lot of great things that come from where we come from. We love the brotherhood that comes with the USAB. These experiences we are going to remember for the rest of our lives. We want to lock in and make the most of it.\"\n\n\"The 3-point line is shorter, and you play with more talent than anything, So I don't have to do everything on the floor,\" Durant said \"You can conserve your energy and use it in different spots, get to travel around the world playing the game. And you're around the best coaches and players in the league. That's simply why I bring myself back every year and that's the best part about it to me.\n\n\"Just being in this environment, the routine, everything that comes with it, I enjoy doing it, especially in the summertime. Sun's out, you vibing out, you hanging out in the summertime. It is just a cool thing. As you get older you really start to appreciate that, like, I might not do this again. Spending my whole career basically with Team USA, I always just want to stay a present and appreciate every moment.\"\n\nDurant was bothered by a sore calf headed into the Olympics and missed the team's five exhibition games. But playing in his first game since the NBA playoffs, Durant scored 23 points on 8-for-9 shooting against Serbia in the Group C opener at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nAgainst Serbia in the semifinals, the U.S. trailed 76-61 late in the third quarter. Durant had not scored and was 0-for-4 from the field. But he made the final shot of the quarter, cutting Serbia's lead to 76-63. His 3-pointer with 7:19 left in the fourth put the U.S. within 78-70 and his pull-up jumper with 34 seconds to play gave the U.S. a 93-89 lead. It turned out to be the winning shot, and Durant scored his nine points in the final 10:08.\n\n\"I felt like I was floating in and out of the game when I was in there,\" Durant said. \"They did a good job of playing the zone and throwing me off a bit, but I just tried to stay into it defensively and I was able to knock a couple down after that.\"\n\nEleven years ago, at USA Basketball mini-camp, then managing director of the men's senior national team Jerry Colangelo held a news conference and called Durant and Kevin Love the faces of USA Basketball. Love never played for Team USA again while Durant ended up one of the great U.S. basketball Olympians.\n\n\"I never looked at basketball like that, just one face, one guy pushing the game forward.

He clarified his thoughts in a subsequent tweet, at 11:40 a.m. Paris time:\n\nWe can only wonder when Durant actually slept that night, given that Team USA didn't return to the team hotel at 1 a.m. local time.

His former Golden State Warriors teammate Stephen Curry is the one who led the team to the comeback victory with 36 points.\n\nTeam USA advanced to the final, where they will face France.

Team USA was down by as many as 17 in the game.\n\nWhile Serbia does feature Denver Nuggets do-it-all big man Nikola Jokic -- arguably the best player in the world right now -- USA was still a prohibitive betting favorite.\n\nThat didn't matter to the Serbs, who fought Team USA tooth and nail in a close game.\n\nUSA ultimately prevailed 95-91, largely thanks to the heroics of Stephen Curry (36 points, nine made three's), Joel Embiid (19 points) ... and yes, Kevin Durant.\n\nThe Suns scorer only notched nine points, but hit a huge jumper to push the lead to four (two possessions) with less than a minute left in the game.\n\nOne would think that Durant would be living off the high of that amazing comeback win on Friday morning.\n\nOne would think wrong, because the high-powered Suns scorer decided to choose violence.\n\nDurant started this X tantrum on Thursday night (Friday morning in Paris), by calling out a prominent Nuggets fan who noted that Jokic took a loaded Team USA to the brink.\n\n\"Serbia just took the most talented team in the history of the planet to the wire with a medal on the line,\" the Nuggets fan posted. \"Team USA was a 16 point favorite.\n\n\"The whole country should be proud.\"\n\nDurant responded to that rather innocuous comment by asking him, \"Where u from??\"\n\nThat response led to a deluge of X posts from Durant, all of which got more and more aggressive with fans.\n\nDurant's next post was in response to a fan who was critical of Durant's original comment: \"To all you nuggets fans, nobody gives a f*** who yall lames believe is the best player in the league, players got major respect for Jok, we don't worship him like yall do but most are in awe of his brilliance.\" (WARNING: Following the link will lead to a post that contains vulgar language that may offend some readers.)\n\n\"Trolling you cornballs for rooting against us is apart of the game. Deal wit it.\"\n\n\"Lets talk about the fan culture that's been created recently,\" Durant posted. \"A lot of huge egos who believe they are the reason for the advancement of a sport.

Nikola Jokic and Bogdan Bogdanovic of the Serbian side were doing everything humanly possible to pull off what would be one of the biggest upsets in international basketball history.\n\nHowever, despite outplaying and outshooting Team USA for the majority of the game, Serbia fell cold in the fourth while the Stars and Stripes got hot. Serbia made a total of 15 threes through the first three quarters at a clip of five per quarter, but they ended up missing all 10 of their three-point attempts in the fourth. As for Team USA, behind Steph Curry's 36 points, Joel Embiid's 19, LeBron James' triple-double, and some late clutch plays by Kevin Durant, they were able to pull off the 95-91 win.\n\nOn top of keeping their gold medal hopes alive, Team USA also got a chance to silence some critics after the game, specifically Durant. While it may have been around five in the morning, Durant was getting in some jabs at fans who appeared to be Americans cheering for Serbia. The conversation didn't just stop at a couple of posts either, as Durant got into a handful of back-and-forths with his latest complaint about fans being the \"corny narratives\" that they create.\n\nFor context, Durant called out the fan culture that he feels has been running rampant lately, which is fans feeling like they are responsible for basketball's growth and them idolizing certain players.\n\n\"Lets talk about the fan culture that's been created recently. A lot of huge egos who believe they are the reason for the advancement of a sport. ALOT of idol worship, a lot of hate and division based off wins and losses, a lot of disrespect of the work being put in by these incredible athletes, mostly by people who don't know what it takes to be good at anything besides talking...go do something and get out the way..\" Durant wrote on X.\n\nA thought that one fan felt has been occurring since the creation of the NBA, and that the only reason players are upset is because fans are gravitating toward international players. Something that Durant shot down immediately.\n\nDurant and Team USA will return to action on Saturday in what may be one of the most hostile environments the sport has seen. The Bercy Arena in Paris can hold around 20,000 people, and with France looking for revenge from the 2020 Olympics, the expectation is that their fans will be out in full force.\n\nAs for Durant, he is clearly enjoying his off time in Paris, and will gladly shoot down any fan-made narratives he doesn't like.\n\nRelated: Kevin Durant's Petty Response To Critic Is Going Viral After Win Over Serbia", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_borba@postandcourier.com", "name": "Kevin Borba", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogdan_Bogdanovi\u0107_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bogdan Bogdanovi\u0107 (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_Stripes_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stars and Stripes (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803289", "eventUri": "eng-9803289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The Americans advanced to the gold medal game, where they will take on France for all the glory.\n\nRead more: USA Basketball Makes Incredible Comeback to Beat Serbia, Advance to Olympics Gold Medal Match\n\nBut being in such a close contest with Serbia was a little concerning, especially for a stacked Team USA roster. Serbia is led by Denver Nuggets All-NBA center Nikola Jokic, and they pushed the Americans to the brink of elimination.\n\nWithout heroic efforts from LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Joel Embiid, and Kevin Durant, the Americans would have embarrassingly lost before the gold medal game. Jokic, winner of three of the NBA's last four MVP trophies, has been one of the better players across the world for years now and showed it once again by keeping Serbia tight with Team USA.\n\nFollowing the Team USA win, some fans of the Nuggets were causing controversy on social media. Without any members of Denver on Team USA, some were rooting for Jokic and were upset when Serbia ended up losing.\n\nDurant responded to fans on social media and went on an NSFW rant regarding the entire situation.\n\n\"To all you nuggets fans, nobody gives a f*** who yall lames believe is the best player in the league, players got major respect for Jok, we don't worship him like yall do but most are in awe of his brilliance. Trolling you cornballs for rooting against us is apart of the game. Deal wit it,\" Durant wrote.\n\nThe players in the NBA understand how good of a player Jokic is and they all respect him for who he is. His ability to keep Serbia in a close game against Team USA shows that he is among the top players in the world and the Americans respect the level of competition.\n\nBut this situation with Durant is another in a long line for him. Fans have been critical of Durant for years over having a soft ego, with the star forward consistently responding to messages on social media.\n\nDurant continued his rant, calling people clowns for their takes. Many believe that with the rise of international talent in the NBA, some American-born players aren't as accepting.\n\n\"That's what yall do, yall clowns. Use players to push these corny agendas yall got. This a brotherhood fam, u not apart of. It's a problem now cuz social media got u clowns walkin around wit your chest out like u mean something. YOU DONT!!! YOUR TAKES DONT MATTER,\" Durant continued.\n\nIt seems that Durant was fed up with all the hate that Team USA has been receiving. The 14-time All-Star has never been shy about letting his opinions be known.\n\nIf Team USA does win the gold medal, all of this will likely be forgotten. But if they fail to win, Durant will likely be called out for his actions.

With Nikola Jokic playing a starring role for Serbia (and his biggest rival, Joel Embiid, playing for Team USA), fans of the Denver Nuggets were actively rooting for Serbia on social media despite living in the United States and being an American citizen. Kevin Durant poked fun at this behavior with his characteristically dry humor on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nDurant, following Team USA's 95-91 comeback win over Serbia, caught wind of a post from X user @SwipaCam, who is a Denver sports analyst for Mile High Sports and is a co-host of the Locked On Nuggets podcast. In this post, the user was congratulating Serbia for pushing Team USA to the brink, even writing that the \"whole country should be proud\". Durant then called him out for this with a short, yet straight to the point question.\n\n\"Where u from??\" Durant wrote.\n\nX user @SwipaCam is from America, but rooting for Nikola Jokic is simply part of who he is as a media personality who covers the Nuggets. But a quick browse through his X account shows that he is vociferous when it comes to defending Jokic from his detractors. He might be even searching Jokic's name and replying to posts criticizing the three-time MVP.\n\nNonetheless, it is very funny that Kevin Durant could find the time in his busy schedule to reply to this one specific post, and at 5:09 A.M. Paris time, no less. Durant loves himself some banter, as he has embraced the villain/anti-hero role that's been cast upon him over the past few years, and not even the powers of space and time can prevent him from roasting those he deems worthy of his time.\n\nKevin Durant serves as Team USA's stabilizing force\n\nIt was confusing when head coach Steve Kerr limited Kevin Durant's minutes in the first half of their tight matchup against Serbia. He played just around seven minutes in the first half as Team USA went down by as many as 17 points, which infuriated many given how game-changing Durant's presence on the court has been throughout the Olympics.\n\nBut in the end, Durant was on the court for Team USA when it mattered the most. Stephen Curry was already on a heater, and putting Durant alongside him gave USA Basketball two players that Serbia could not leave unattended at all times. Durant made a few clutch baskets, including a difficult midrange jumper at the top of the key over the outstretched arms of Filip Petrusev that gave them a 93-89 lead with only 34 seconds left in the contest.\n\nKevin Durant is only cementing his case as the greatest basketball player in the history of Team USA; earlier in the Olympics, he became the all-time leading scorer of the national team, men and women combined. Now, he only needs to win one more game to tally the fourth gold medal of his career.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jedd_pagaduan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jedd Pagaduan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kevin-Durant-roasts-Nuggets-fan-over-Team-USA-Serbia-take.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803289", "eventUri": "eng-9803289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

It was one of Durant's worst games for the U.S., as he went scoreless in the first half and didn't get his first bucket until late in the third. Seven of his nine points came in the fourth quarter, but Durant's defense was a key part of the relentless comeback.\n\nWhile the rally was impressive, Durant wasn't done with the game after it ended. Durant, who loves to clap back online and has a history of using burner accounts, jumped into the conversation on X at 5 a.m. Paris time.\n\nOne user, named Swipa, gave Serbia a shoutout for its effort against the U.S.\n\n\"Serbia just took the most talented team in the history of the planet to the wire with a medal on the line,\" Swipa wrote. \"Team USA was a 16 point favorite. The whole country should be proud.\"\n\n\"To all you nuggets fans, nobody gives a f -- who yall lames believe is the best player in the league,\" Durant said in response to a Nuggets fan's tweet. \"Players got major respect for Jok, we don't worship him like yall do but most are in awe of his brilliance.

A lot of flexing for only just beating a nation of 6.6m in a sport they invented. Acting like Jokic fans are committing treason.\"\n\nKD did not hold back in his response: \"Lets talk about the fan culture that's been created recently. A lot of huge egos who believe they are the reason for the advancement of a sport.

He added to his glittering clap-back legacy on Friday morning, delivering an elegy of sorts towards basketball fans, particularly those of the Denver Nuggets' variety.\n\nDurant is an American hoops icon, not just for his performances at the club level, but the way he elevates his displays for his country, as well. He's USA Basketball's all-time leading scorer and rebounder, and he played a pivotal role in lifting Steve Kerr's squad to yet another gold medal game on Thursday night, recording nine points -- including a timely stepback jumper -- in USA's 95-91 win over Serbia.\n\nMORE: USA vs. France prediction in gold medal game for 2024 Olympics\n\nWhen the dust settled on Thursday's epic, many were in awe of the Serbians' effort.

Durant disagreed, acknowledging that Jokic is widely cherished and respected around league circles. However, Joker's colleagues \"don't worship him\" like Nuggets fans do.\n\nMORE: Why Bogdan Bogdanovic, Serbia have beef with Carmelo Anthony\n\nDurant used his latest tiff with Denver supporters as a way to roundly criticize fan culture as a whole, arguing that the league's fanbase believes \"they are the reason for the advancement of the sport,\" not the players themselves.\n\n\"A lot disrespect of the work being put in by these incredible athletes,\" Durant wrote, \"Mostly by people who don't know what it takes to be good at anything besides talking. ...Go do something and get out the way.\"\n\nIf there's one thing Durant will do, it's clap back. That desire to rebut fans' criticism -- whether warranted or not -- seems to have transcended time zones, international waters and different continents, too.\n\nDurant's Suns will take on Jokic's Nuggets on Christmas Day.

The Americans prevail 95-91 after outsourcing their opposition 32-15 in the fourth quarter to advance to the gold medal game against host nation France on Saturday.\n\nDurant, now the all-time leading scorer in USA Basketball history and a Texas Ex, was once again trusted by Head Coach Steve Kerr to be part of the American lineup to close the game despite scoring only two points in the first three quarters. Predictably, the \"easy money sniper\" proved his former NBA head coach correct, hitting two massive shots.\n\nThe first came as Team USA faced an 11-point deficit with 7:19 left. James brought the ball up and found Durant open on the wing behind an Anthony Davis screen. Durant didn't think twice and knocked down the three despite Serbia superstar Nikola Jokic knocking Davis over, sending the seven-footer into Durant's legs. Due to this foul, the Americans immediately got the ball back, resulting in a Devin Booker three from the top of the key on the inbound. The lead was now only five, and the run would continue.\n\nThe former Longhorn's most consequential moment would come as the US was clinging onto a two-point lead with under a minute to go. As Durant received the ball from James at the top of the key, their former USA basketball teammate, Carmelo Anthony, stood courtside, imploring Durant to exploit the isolation against his defender. With a between-the-legs and then a pair of his signature crossovers, that is exactly what Durant did, calmly knocking down a long two to all but end Serbia's chances at an upset.\n\nDurant and his teammates look forward to Saturday's gold medal match at 2:30 CT against 20-year-old phenom Victor Wembanyama and hosts France. The Americans are favored by 16.5 points, per sportsbookreview.com, in the rematch of the gold medal game from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, in which Team USA won 87-82 behind a game-high 29 points from Durant.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_hopper@postandcourier.com", "name": "Ryan Hopper", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803289", "eventUri": "eng-9803289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

They came back from a 17-point deficit to script a famous win where three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic saw his Gold medal hopes vanish.\n\nDurant had eight points in the win, with an ice-cold jumper to extend the lead to four points with under a minute left to seal the game for the USA. It's clear that the lack of support coming from Americans who are siding with their franchise player instead of their country bother Durant, as he elaborated hours later.\n\n\"To all you Nuggets fans, nobody gives a f**k who y'all lames believe is the best player in the league. Players got major respect for Jok, we don't worship him like y'all do but most are in awe of his brilliance. Trolling you cornballs for rooting against us is a part of the game. Deal with it.\"\n\nDurant clearly respects Jokic and what he's achieved but is sick of his fans trying to bring down their own national team while they're competing for an Olympic Gold. It is odd that Jokic means more to many American Nuggets than their own national team, but they're probably more invested in the narrative of the superteam falling to the star player with lesser talent around him.\n\nKevin Durant Will Never Forget This Night\n\nDurant was in a very thoughtful mood after that hard-fought win, openly celebrating the win despite the Gold medal game coming on Saturday because of how electric the win was. Regardless of the result, it was a night that Durant thinks he and the players won't ever forget.\n\n\"Come on man, y'all acting like we won't celebrate a win like that. Look at all our families here, look at this. That's what this is about. All coming together as one on the other side of the world like this. Our section started USA chants, it was special tonight. We gotta celebrate. I know we ain't win Gold, but you gotta celebrate the small moments too.\n\n\"I guarantee that everybody here will never forget about this night. Everybody here will remember this night for the rest of their lives. That's how special this is because we came back and showed how together we were in that fourth quarter. It was incredible.\n\nThe lack of support from American Nuggets fans probably hurt Durant more because he takes genuine pride in representing the USA at the Olympics and expects his countrymen to root for them.\n\n\"When you come to the Olympics, you see the pride in representing your country. You see the pride that Serbia has for their country. You see fans singing the anthem during the game. We love playing for the US, especially when a lot of bullsh*t goes on in our country.\"\n\nDurant is averaging 13.6 points at Paris 2024. He'll suit up next against France in the Gold medal game on Saturday.\n\nRelated: Kevin Durant On Stephen Curry: \"That Was A Godlike Performance\"\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Durant was excellent in the gold medal game in 2021, scoring a game-high 29 points.\n\nThe United States won 87-82, defeating a French team with many of the same players as the current roster.\n\nThe major difference in the 2024 final will be French sensation Victor Wembanyama, the reigning NBA Rookie of the Year. Team USA will need to find a way to contain Wembanyama if they want to leave Paris with a fifth consecutive gold medal.\n\nRelated: LeBron James Reveals What Carmelo Anthony Told Him Against Serbia", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kameron_duncan@postandcourier.com", "name": "Kameron Duncan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803289", "eventUri": "eng-9803289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

We also know that he has never been shy about getting into a social media squabble if he sees a take that he disagrees with.\n\nBoth his hooping skills and Twitter fingers were on display on Thursday as he played a key role in Team USA's come-from-behind win against Serbia. The U.S. came into the game as 15.5-point favorites but found themselves on the ropes all game. Serbia was able to build a double-digit lead that grew to as many as 17 points in a game that looked like it would be them taking on France in the gold medal game.\n\nHowever, Steph Curry's electric shooting, combined with the dominant showings from Joel Embiid and LeBron James, was able to power the Stars and Stripes to a victory.\n\nAt the same time, it was a few massive plays from Durant down the stretch that really helped swing the game. He hit a big three to cut the lead to 70-78, hit a jumper a couple of possessions later to answer a Serbian jumper, grabbed a rebound that led to an Embiid jumper that cut the lead to 82-84, had a nice assist to James to tie the game at 84 and later hit a dagger jumper to go up 93-89 before they ended up winning 95-91.\n\nDurant finished with just nine points, three rebounds and an assist, but his biggest plays all came in the biggest moments. He also made sure to silence a critic on the app formerly known as Twitter after an analyst who covers the Nuggets praised Nikola Jokic and Serbia. The initial tweet now has over two million views, and Durant's response, which has been up for about an hour or so, has over one million, and fans are loving it.\n\nFor those who aren't aware of what time it is for Durant, at the time of his post, it was around 5 in the morning. Meaning, Durant is not missing out on any of the social media buzz and is also taking some time to let people know he will not tolerate any Team USA slander.\n\nWith the win, Team USA will have a chance to win their fifth-straight gold medal. However, they will have to beat the host country, France, in front of what may be one of the most hostile crowds that the sport of basketball has seen. The French crowd will surely pack the Bercy Arena, which holds around 20,000 people, as they look to kick off what could be their golden generation of basketball led by Victor Wembanyama.\n\nThe French will also be motivated by the fact that Durant and Team USA got the best of them in 2020 at the Tokyo Olympics. Safe to say that this may be one of the most highly-anticipated gold medal games ever.\n\nRelated: Bronny James, Bryce James Go Viral For Unexpected Reason During Team USA's Win\n\nRelated: Anthony Davis' Confusing Quote is Going Viral After USA vs. Serbia\n\nRelated: Dwyane Wade Assigns Iconic Nickname To Team USA's Olympic Win Over Serbia", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_borba@postandcourier.com", "name": "Kevin Borba", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803289", "eventUri": "eng-9803289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Leslie finished her four Olympic appearances with 488 points and four gold medals.\n\nHe finished with 11 points, so the new record is 494 -- and counting.\n\n\"Records are meant to be broken,\" Durant said. \"Somebody will come along to do the same. I'm focused on trying to win this gold.\"\n\nDurant is bidding to become the first men's player in Olympic history with four golds after being part of the U.S. teams that won titles at London 2012, Rio de Janeiro 2016 and the Tokyo Games that were held three years ago.\n\n\"Training staffs, the work that we put in, just keeping my body ready and just staying in the gym, to be honest,\" Durant said when asked last week what he attributes to his longevity.\n\nDurant is the No. 8 scorer in NBA history with 28,924 points, No. 2 on the active list behind only U.S. Olympic teammate LeBron James' 40,474.\n\n\"Well let me start to (congratulate) @KDTrey5 as he gets ready to break one of my Olympic records! The Slim Reaper!! One of my all time favorites!\" Leslie wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, last week as the perennial All-Star closed in on her mark.\n\nAnd Durant is likely going to keep this record for some time.\n\nHe's one of only five U.S. players with at least 300 points in Olympic competition, joining Leslie, WNBA career scoring leader Diana Taurasi (416 entering the U.S. women's quarterfinal game Wednesday), the retired Carmelo Anthony (336) and James, who is presumably playing in the Olympics for the final time and entered Tuesday with 316 points in his four appearances.\n\n\"He's one of the most efficient players that ever played this game,\" U.S. teammate -- and Phoenix Suns teammate -- Devin Booker said of Durant.\n\nDurant is also the U.S. career men's leader in rebounds in Olympic play, entering Tuesday with 126. He secured that record in the group-stage finale Saturday against Puerto Rico, his four rebounds in that game allowing him to pass both Anthony (125) and David Robinson (124) for the top spot there.\n\nLeslie remains -- far and away -- the career leader in U.S. Olympic play for rebounding with 241 in her 32 games.\n\nWhat is Peacock Premium?\n\nPeacock Premium is a video streaming service from NBC that includes complete event-by-event coverage of the 2024 Summer Olympics, plus a huge library of content, including episodes of \"The Office,\" \"Parks & Recreation,\" and more hit NBC TV series.

He contributed nine points, three rebounds, and one assist.\n\n\"I feel like I was floating in and out of the game,\" he commented, \"They did a good job of playing the zone and throwing this off a bit. But I just tried to stay into it defensively and I was able to knock a couple down in that fourth.\"\n\nFacing Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid tallied 19 points. \"Incredible,\" mentioned Durant, \"He showed why he is one of the greatest ever to touch a basketball. He was finishing over the rim, knocking down shots, putting those guys in foul trouble.\"\n\n\"Another dogfight\"\n\nThe team coached by Steve Kerr trailed for most of the 40 minutes with the deficit peaking at 17 points. At the break, Serbia was up 54-43.\n\n\"We just said we got to keep going,\" Durant revealed the team talks during halftime, \"They made some tough shots in the first half. They hit some bank threes, some fadeaway threes. Guys that had been making shots throughout the tournament, knocked some shots down. So, we tried not to get too discouraged, but in that fourth quarter, I mean, late in the third quarter, they hit us pretty hard. We were down but we just kept pushing. We knew our defense would win this basketball game.\"\n\nWrapping up the tournament on Saturday, the USA faces host France for the gold medals. At the individual level, Durant can become the first four-time Olympic gold medalist for the men's program of USA Basketball.\n\n\"Just another dogfight,\" predicted the experienced forward, \"It is at their home, and we know how the crowd is going to be. That is going to be the most watched game.\"\n\n\"I am excited for that. and we all are. Tonight was a great test for us and we know what we are made of. We know what we can do. We have been in the situation being down this big, this late, so we prepare for anything,\" he added.\n\n\"We love playing for our country\"\n\nRepresenting the United States emerged as another topic of discussion with Durant highlighting several reasons to play for Team USA.\n\n\"I love representing our country. We all love representing our country. You see the pride about your country when you come and play in the Olympics,\" he mentioned, \"You see the pride and the service you have for their country. You see their fans singing their national anthem throughout the game. We played Brazil. You see their fans and the pride that they have for their country. We love playing for our country.\"\n\n\"A lot of bullshit goes on in our country too, but there are a lot of great things that come from where we come from,\" he continued, \"We love that and we love the brotherhood that comes with the USAB. These experiences, we will remember them for the rest of our lives. So, we want to lock in and make the most of it. Especially this time of the country's history.\"\n\nPhoto Credit: FIBA\n\nRead the latest News", "source": {"uri": "eurohoops.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurohoops"}, "authors": [{"uri": "giannis_askounis@eurohoops.net", "name": "Giannis Askounis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_foul_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal foul (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.eurohoops.net/2024/08/9ba7f975-stephen-curry-kevin-durant-antony-davis-celebrate-usa-olympics-fiba-600x314.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803289", "eventUri": "eng-9803289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

He acknowledged the complexities of the nation, stating that a lot of bad things happen, but a lot of great things happen, too. This candid reflection resonates deeply with many Americans, highlighting the duality of national pride.\n\nAs of now, the United States has amassed an impressive 103 medals at the 2024 Olympics, leading the medal count ahead of China, which has secured 73. The U.S. holds the record for the most gold (30), silver (38), and bronze (35) medals, further solidifying its dominance in the Olympic arena.\n\nThe U.S. men's basketball team is poised to add another medal to this impressive tally. If they triumph on Saturday, Durant will earn his fourth Olympic gold medal, surpassing Carmelo Anthony for the most all-time on the Team USA men's basketball team. This achievement would also make him the first male athlete in Olympic history to win four gold medals in a team sport.\n\nThis year has been particularly memorable for Durant, who recently became the all-time leading scorer in Olympic history for Team USA basketball during a match against Brazil. His contributions to the team have been invaluable, and his pursuit of excellence continues to inspire young athletes across the nation.\n\nAs the U.S. men's basketball team prepares for the gold medal game, the excitement and anticipation are palpable.

The Slim Reaper is widely praised for his scoring abilities from all levels on the floor. KD's skills were on full display during the Team USA vs. Serbia semifinal matchup at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nIn fact, Durant sealed the game for USAB in the dying seconds of the fourth quarter with a beautiful mid-range jumper. Apart from his basketball abilities, if there is one thing the Phoenix Suns superstar is known for, it's never mincing his words.\n\nKevin is always quick with responses, be it the on-court interviews or feuds with fans on social media platforms. The 35-year-old gave a candid quote about Team USA amid the quest for a gold medal.\n\nKD opens up on the duality of being an American\n\nRepresenting their country at the Olympics is unarguably one of the greatest feelings for an athlete. But does it mean they become blind to the negative aspects of the nation? Certainly not.\n\nDurant was asked about his feelings on patriotism while representing the USA at the 2024 Paris Olympics. As expected, KD's answer didn't disappoint fans.\n\nIn a way, Durant compares life as an American to Team USA's 95-91 win over Serbia. After all, USAB trailed by 13 points heading into the game's final quarter. But at the end of the day, thanks to some key performances from Stephen Curry, LeBron James, and Joel Embiid, the U.S. prevailed to a historic win.\n\nRelated: Patrick Beverley talks about his full circle moment with Michael Jordan: \"His boat a little bigger than mine, but I came on a boat too\"\n\nDurant is a Team USA legend\n\nWhen it comes to the Slim Reaper's NBA career, many have questioned his decisions over the years. Leaving the OKC Thunder to join the Golden State Warriors essentially made him a villain for most of the NBA community.\n\nSince then, KD has continued to get on the negative side of many fans due to joining two more superteams in Brooklyn and Phoenix. However, when it comes to representing the USA at the Olympics, there are hardly any players who surpass him.\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics will hold a special place in Kevin's heart as he became the USA's all-time scorer. Since then, KD has received constant praise from basketball fans, including an amazing Nike commercial narrated by NFL legend Deion Sanders.\n\nDurant will be competing against France to win the fourth Olympic gold medal of his career.

He eventually went to bed, but as soon as he was up again it was right back to arguing online.\n\nEssentially Durant's argument boils down to this: There's a forced narrative, largely predicated on the marketing machine that sells the concept of the \"battle\" that has fans believing that players around the league actively dislike each other. While there are certainly some who don't get along, for the most part there's nothing but mutual respect between NBA players.\n\nDurant is furious that American fans would be pushing Jokic over Team USA just because of their NBA allegiances, and thinks that's really dumb. Especially when behind the scenes nobody has any disrespect for Joker, which eliminates the \"Nikola vs. the world\" narrative.\n\nIt's kinda fair, but also KD should probably just drop this one and concentrate on the medal.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_dator@sbnation.com", "name": "James Dator", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democrats_(Sweden)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christian Democrats (Sweden)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SakLALJ46zfNOC9fQmaUrzU4gCM=/0x0:1184x592/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25565599/Screen_Shot_2024_08_09_at_10.28.58_AM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803289", "eventUri": "eng-9803289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

KD's play and leadership on the floor have long spoken for themselves, but it was what he did in the early hours of Friday morning that has every American basketball fan ready to run through a wall ahead of the gold medal game against France.\n\nAfter the U.S. pulled off the double-digit comeback in the fourth quarter against three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic and the Serbs, a sports analyst in Denver fired off a post on X praising Serbia's efforts.\n\nDurant took notice of the tweet hours later, and from there, he began to cook.\n\nIt's worth pointing out the time of Durant's tweet, as it came just after 5 AM Paris time. He woke up in the City of Love ready to snatch souls, and that's exactly what he did. He specifically took issue with Nuggets fans, presumably American Nuggets fans, who were pulling against Team USA simply because Jokic plays for Denver.\n\nCornballs is the adjective he used to describe them.\n\nSome random guy from Australia decided to enter the conversation and badmouth American sports culture, which turned out to be a huge mistake for the Aussie.\n\nIt wasn't just a few fiery posts on social from Durant that had Americans fired up, either, he reminded the world that it's great to be an American. Forget all the never-ending political drama and divide in the country, the United States is still the greatest land on Earth.\n\nIt could have been incredibly easy for American hoops fans to turn on this Team USA squad with Steve Kerr as the head coach and LeBron James doing LeBron James things, but instead, most around the country seem to have embraced this team on its quest for gold.\n\nThe U.S. will take on France in what should surely be a classic at 3:30 PM ET on Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_harris@outkick.com", "name": "Mark Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rogers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Money_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Easy Money (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165401792.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803289", "eventUri": "eng-9803289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

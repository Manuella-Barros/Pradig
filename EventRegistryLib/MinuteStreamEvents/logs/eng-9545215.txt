More than 27,000 buses will be in service, he added, and the high-speed Al-Haramain and Al-Mashaer trains will complete more than 5,000 journeys.\n\nThe Indian ambassador to the Kingdom, Suhel Ajaz Khan, who joined the Saudi ministers in greeting the first of this year's pilgrims, told Arab News: \"The Indian mission in Saudi Arabia stands fully ready to welcome Indian pilgrims and ensure a fulfilling experience for the Hajj 2024.\n\n\"This year, the Consulate General of India in Jeddah, in close coordination with concerned ministries of the government of India and the support of the concerned agencies in Saudi Arabia, has exerted the utmost efforts to put in place a well-planned, thorough operational architecture for facilitating a smooth Hajj experience for the pilgrims.\n\n\"We have a new smart app, Haj Suvidha app, which we have developed for pilgrims' facilitation and grievance redressal mechanism, aiming to ensure a seamless pilgrimage journey with our app, dedicated to simplifying the Hajj application process for Indian citizens.\n\n\"This seamless operational Hajj 2024 architecture, created by the (Indian consulate) has now been set in motion with the arrival of the first two flights carrying Indian Hajj pilgrims from Hyderabad and New Delhi. Eleven more flights are expected to arrive during the course of the day, which will see around 4,000 Indian Hajj pilgrims arriving on the first day in Madinah.\"\n\nThe first Hajj flight from Bangladesh, carrying 415 pilgrims, landed at King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah on Thursday morning. The country's ambassador to the Kingdom, Mohammad Javed Patwary, joined other officials from the Bangladeshi mission in welcoming them at the airport.\n\n\"We are really happy to serve the pilgrims from Bangladesh,\" the envoy told Arab News. \"We have seen smooth service for the last three years under the Makkah Route Initiative; it is going better and better every year.\n\n\"Officials from all the concerned Saudi ministries, including the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah and the Ministry of Health, are here to welcome the pilgrims and help to make this lifetime journey a smooth experience.\"\n\nThe Makkah Route Initiative is part of Saudi Arabia's Guests of God Service Program, inaugurated by King Salman in 2019. It seeks to provide visitors to the holy sites with the best possible services to help them perform their Hajj rituals easily and comfortably.\n\nThe first of this year's Hajj flights from Malaysia arrived on Thursday, in Madinah. The country's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Datuk Wan Zaidi Wan Abdullah, told Arab News: \"The Makkah Route service pre-clearance arrangement has greatly benefited Malaysian Hajj pilgrims.\n\n\"This year, 31,600 Hajj pilgrims will benefit from the initiative and Malaysia is ready to expand the Makkah Route service for Umrah pilgrims, who (number) approximately 400,000 visitors annually.\"\n\nThe first Hajj pilgrims from Pakistan also arrived in Madinah, where they were welcomed by the Pakistani ambassador to the Kingdom, Ahmad Farooq, Consul General Khalid Majid and senior Saudi officials.\n\nThe pilgrims arrived on flights from Karachi, Multan, Lahore and Islamabad. More than 2,100 were expected to arrive in Madinah on the first day, and the total number of Pakistani pilgrims expected to perform Hajj this year is 179,210. About half of them will do so under government schemes, the rest through private Hajj tour companies.\n\nPakistani officials said they have prepared the necessary accommodation for the pilgrims and will provide them with all required services and facilities, including a medical mission comprising 500 medical staff, including doctors and specialists.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the first batch of pilgrims from South Africa arrived in Jeddah.\n\nHajj is expected to begin on or around June 14 and conclude on June 19.", "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"},

This departure process will last until June 10, 2024.\n\nYaqut will be in Saudi Arabia for four days and return to Indonesia on May 11, 2024. \"We will also meet with Masyariq in Jeddah, to update the preparations of several services under their responsibility,\" said Yaqut.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of Religious Affairs would discuss mitigation measures to ensure services run smoothly. \"Both in Mecca and Medina, we will check the preparation of hotels and consumption for the Hajj pilgrims. We will also inspect the readiness of the shalawat bus terminal in Mecca, both in Syib Amir and Ajyad,\" he said.\n\nBefore the Hajj pilgrims arrive in Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of Religious Affairs will dispatch the 2024 Saudi Arabian Hajj Organizing Officers (PPIH). The Saudi Arabian PPIH advance team departed on May 2, 2024.\n\nFurthermore, the PPIH Airport and Madinah Division will depart on May 8, 2024. Meanwhile, the PPIH Mecca division is scheduled to embark on May 15, 2024.\n\n\"God willing, I will escort the embarkation of the first group of Indonesian Hajj pilgrims at Soekarno-Hatta Airport, on May 12, 2024,\" said Yaqut.\n\nDEFARA DHANYA PARAMITHA", "source": {"uri": "en.tempo.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TEMPO.CO"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laila_afifa@en.tempo.co", "name": "Laila Afifa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaqut_al-Hamawi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yaqut al-Hamawi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Religious_Affairs_(Indonesia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Religious Affairs (Indonesia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Arafat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mount Arafat"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holy Land"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabian Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jakarta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jakarta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzdalifah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muzdalifah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Muzdalifah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mina,_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mina, Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mina, Saudi Arabia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God in Islam"}}], "categories": [], "image": "https://statik.tempo.co/data/2023/06/26/id_1214894/1214894_720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545215", "eventUri": "eng-9545215", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jakarta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-05-", "textStart": 680, "textEnd": 686, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-06-", "textStart": 733, "textEnd": 740}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-05-", "textStart": 820, "textEnd": 826}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-05-", "textStart": 1660, "textEnd": 1666}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

If you are living in the UAE, there are different ways in which you can go about the process. In this guide, we will break down the registration process and the new requirements that you need to be aware of before the Hajj season begins next month.\n\nHow to register for Hajj\n\nIf you are a UAE national, you can register for Hajj through the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments. Expatriates would need to register for Hajj through a travel agent. This is because registering for Hajj needs to be done through your individual country's quota. Each country gets a specific quota for pilgrims for Hajj, according to Husham Kattingeri, an outbound travel supervisor at Regal Tours Worldwide, and travel agents who deal with your home country's Hajj agencies can help you register.\n\nGet exclusive content with Gulf News WhatsApp channel\n\n\"We deal mainly with Indian expatriates when it comes to Hajj, as we have a contract with agencies in India to take a certain quota from India for visa issuance,\" he said.\n\nSo, an easy way to register is to reach out to the travel agency and ask them if they can assist you with the registration. Kattingeri added that for expats in the UAE, this process is easier compared to going to their home country to apply for a Hajj permit through the government quota. However, that is also an option if you are interested.\n\nIf you do choose to book your Hajj package through a travel agent in the UAE, most packages include flight tickets, hotel stays and food.\n\n\"Even when they go to Medina, they can choose whether they want a full board or half board, so the package is customised accordingly. The only thing that is not included in the package is the animal sacrifice at the end of Hajj, which they need to pay for directly at the location,\" he said.\n\nIt is advisable to register for Hajj as soon as registrations open, as prices can be higher at the end of the season, with most quotas already filled.\n\nWhat are the documents I would need?\n\nIf you are applying through a travel agent, you would need to submit the following documents:\n\n* Passport copy, with the passport valid at least till the end of the Hajj season (valid for six months from the date of application submission)\n\n* Passport photograph\n\n* Proof of vaccinations. According to an announcement by the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, international pilgrims are required to have the meningococcal vaccine administered at least 10 days but not more than five years prior to their arrival, verified by a certificate from their home country. They must also be vaccinated against polio.\n\nKattingeri added: \"Country to country there can be a few requirements that are different. For example, for Indian nationals, they are required to submit their PAN (Permanent Account Number) card and Adhar card copy when they register for Hajj.\"\n\nCountry to country there can be a few requirements that are different. - Husham Kattingeri, an outbound travel supervisor at Regal Tours Worldwide\n\nNew rules you should keep in mind 1. New Hajj permit through Nusuk\n\nObtain a Hajj permit through the Nusk platform, which is crucial for the legitimacy of their pilgrimage. The 'Nusuk' app, which is available for Apple and Android devices, is the 'official guide to Mecca and Medina', providing pilgrims with information on immigration requirements, rituals that need to be followed during Umrah and details on various sites within Mecca and Medina that people can visit. The Hajj permit will be available through the app.\n\nOn April 27, the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah (MOHU) stated that the Council of Senior Scholars has issued a Fatwa that bans performing Hajj without an official permit.\n\n\"Undertaking the Hajj without a permit not only jeapordises your safety but also poses a significant risk to fellow pilgrims. Such actions are not in line with Shariah law and are considered grave transgressions against the directives issued for the public good,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Registration for Nusuk is quite easy, and you can complete it online, by providing your Hajj visa number and some basic visa details,\" Qaiser Mahmoud, a travel agent based in Sharjah, told Gulf News.\n\n\"If you are going for Hajj in a group, the group agent may also be able to help you complete the registration. But the Nusuk permit will be on your phone,\" he added.\n\nRegistration for Nusuk is quite easy, and you can complete it online, by providing your Hajj visa number and some basic visa details. - Qaiser Mahmoud, a travel agent based in Sharjah\n\n2. Minimum age for Hajj application - 12 years\n\nAnother rule to remember is that Saudi Arabia has set the minimum age for performing Hajj at 12 years.\n\nAlso read Saudi Arabia sets 12 years as minimum age to perform Hajj 3. Registration through the Sehhaty application is required to verify vaccination status.\n\nYou also need to register in the Sehhaty app to confirm the necessary vaccinations. The app by the Saudi Ministry of Health is available for Apple, Andoid and Huawei devices and you can complete your registration online.\n\nFines for violating Hajj rules\n\nOn May 7, the Saudi Ministry of Interior also posted on its official social media accounts the penalties that would be implemented if the rules are violated.\n\nFine of SAR10,000 (Dh9,792) against all citizens and residents who are caught without a Hajj permit and visitors in the following places:\n\n- The city of Mecca\n\n- Central area\n\n- Sacred sites\n\n- Al-Haramain Train Station in Al-Rasifa\n\n- Security control centres\n\n- Sorting centres\n\n- Temporary security control centres\n\nThe post added that violating residents will face deportation to their country and prevented from entering Saudi Arabia according to the system-specified periods.\n\nThe fine imposed on violators, amounting to SAR10,000 (Dh9,792), will be doubled if the violation is repeated.", "source": {"uri":

( Image Source :PTI )\n\nThe first batch of Hajj pilgrims left for Saudi Arabia on Thursday from Delhi's IGI airport at 2:20 am. The flight, carrying 285 pilgrims, headed for the 40-day pilgrimage to the Islamic pilgrimage sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\nSharing their joy before departing for Hajj, a pilgrim said, \"I can't describe my happiness. It is bigger than any happiness in life. Allah has called me. My Dua is to seek Allah's blessing for everyone. It is now easier as we can go directly from Srinagar and need not go to Delhi.\"\n\nAijaz Hussain, from J&K Member Haj Committee of India, congratulated the pilgrims going to perform Hajj for the year 2024.\n\nHe said, \"All the facilities have been taken care of. 37 women without mahram are going for Hajj this time. A total of around 7,000 pilgrims will be going to perform Hajj this year from J&K.\"\n\nHajj is one of the five fundamental pillars of Islam and the annual pilgrimage is undertaken by Muslims the world over.\n\nKausar Jahan, the chairperson of the Delhi State Haj Committee, said the government has introduced the 'Har Suvidha' mobile application for the convenience of the pilgrims.\n\n\"The support and facilities for the pilgrims have been getting better under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We have introduced the 'Har Suvidha' mobile application this year for the convenience of the pilgrims as well as their security during the journey. In the event of an emergency or an unforeseen situation, the app will connect a pilgrim directly to the control room and help centre. As many as 16,500 pilgrims are registered to depart Delhi for Haj this year,\" she said.\n\nTo add to the smoothness of the Hajj experience, the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had earlier announced that the Umrah visa will remain valid for three months from the date of issuance. This adjustment aims to ensure a seamless journey for pilgrims to the sacred destinations of Makkah and Madinah.\n\nRecently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an election rally mentioned how only the influential could get the chance to go and perform Hajj.\n\nHe also said that upon his insistence, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia increased the Haj quota for Indian Muslims. Visa rules have also been updated allowing Muslim women to go for Hajj alone.\n\nThe first Hajj flight pilgrims have been received by Dr Suhel Khan, joined by Minister of Transport & Logistic Services H.E.

Pilgrims can also submit complaints and observations, among other features available in both printed and digital versions of the card. They announced that the \"Nusuk\" card, launched during Hajj and Umrah Minister Tawfiq bin Fawzan Al-Rabiah's recent visit to the Republic of Indonesia, offers various features to assist pilgrims. These features streamline their movement and provide important alerts, including information about groupings.\n\nIn a social media post on X and Facebook, it was emphasized that the journey toward fulfilling one's religious obligations begins with obtaining a Hajj visa, adhering to pilgrim regulations, and ensuring access to all necessary services and facilities. This year, smart cards were introduced to enhance pilgrim services. These cards, developed in collaboration with relevant authorities, facilitate the performance of Hajj rituals by providing access to health services, verifying pilgrim identities for organizing authorities and enabling online assistance.\n\nEarlier, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Hajj and Umrah announced the launch of a pilgrim card for the annual pilgrimage of Hajj 2024. They revealed that the card is in digital and physical (print) formats. The print copy will be delivered to pilgrims through their respective Hajj missions or service-provider companies and establishments with which the pilgrims have concluded contracts to perform the pilgrimage.\n\nThe digital copy will be available through the pilgrim's account using the Nusuk application. Regarding how to access the digital version of the Nusuk application, the pilgrim must scan the QR code on the printed card and then follow the instructions to obtain the digital version of the card. The Nusuk pilgrim card aims to improve the efficiency of operational procedures for the upcoming Hajj season, making the pilgrimage easier and simpler and reducing instances of illegal Hajj.\n\nIt urges pilgrims from within Saudi Arabia and abroad to obtain the card before arriving at the holy sites. Foreign and domestic pilgrims are obliged to carry the card during their travel and movements throughout the Hajj period from their arrival until their departure. The card is mandatory for entry and travel within the holy cities of Mecca and Medina as well as for their movement between the Holy Sites of Mina, Arafat and Muzdalifah. The card provides a wide range of services for the pilgrims.\n\nThe most important of these services is proving the pilgrim's identity in front of the relevant authorities and enabling them to verify his data to provide the best possible services. The card will also provide key information such as the pilgrim's personal data, address, and health records linked to a smartphone application. It also contains details of the pilgrim's respective Hajj mission and ways to communicate with it, as well as the schedules of the pilgrims' groupings and residential addresses.\n\nPilgrims can also receive special alerts, evaluate the services provided, and file their observations and complaints via digital card. The ministry called on all aspiring Hajj pilgrims to avoid fake Hajj campaigns and bogus Hajj service providers. It urged pilgrims to apply for Hajj only through official agencies and channels. They noted that applications for domestic pilgrims are submitted electronically. For foreign pilgrims, their application procedures are through the Hajj missions in their respective countries, except for pilgrims from countries where there are no Hajj missions. Such pilgrims must submit their applications for Hajj through the Nusuk Hajj platform.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umrah", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Umrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrim", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pilgrim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smart card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Arafat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mount Arafat"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzdalifah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muzdalifah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Muzdalifah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mina,_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mina, Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mina, Saudi Arabia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Phone_Cards_-_Phone_Service_Reps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Phone Cards - Phone Service Reps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2024/05/07/thumbs/800x531/326719.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545215", "eventUri": "eng-9545215", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The Sullis Hajj Card encapsulates the concept of internationally enabling pilgrims to manage their expenses without the need to carry cash.\n\n\"For the first time in Pakistan, this initiative enables a cashless Hajj in the first phase and later on Umrah experience, offering ease of transactions with reduced charges and almost no taxes otherwise applicable on all traditional cards during international transactions,\" Jawad Mahmood, chief executive officer of MyTM Saudi Arabia, told Arab News on the sidelines of the Sullis Hajj Card launch in Islamabad.\n\nThrough this card, he said, MyTM, Zindigi, JS Bank, and MasterCard were collaborating to offer pilgrims favorable exchange rates, easy money withdrawal and a wide acceptability across Saudi Arabia and other parts of the world.\n\nHajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and requires every adult Muslim to undertake the journey to the holy Islamic sites in Makkah at least once in their lifetime if they are financially and physically able.\n\nPakistan has a Hajj quota of 179,210 pilgrims this year. Of them, 63,805 pilgrims will be performing the pilgrimage under the government scheme, while the rest would be accommodated by private tour operators, according to the Pakistani religious affairs ministry.\n\nThe Hajj card will be launched for public on May 15, with applications opening through the MyTM app, according to the MyTM Saudi Arabia official. The innovative financial product is a great example of moving forward on Pakistan's national financial inclusion policy and Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 as both governments are currently focusing on digital economy.\n\n\"Right now, a lot of people who are going there face a lot of issues sometimes they have some currency exchange issues, sometimes they get high rates and sometimes they lose their money,\" Mahmood said, adding the initiative would not only enhance convenience but also increase financial security of pilgrims performing Hajj and Umrah.\n\nRizwan Saeed Qureshi, an additional secretary for the Middle East in Pakistan's foreign ministry, termed the Hajj card a \"good omen\" for Pakistan's fintech sector.\n\n\"This is the first-ever pilot to the best of our understanding for cashless Hajj to start with and certainly subsequently Umrah,\" he told Arab News.\n\n\"Hopefully it will succeed as a pilot and then expand in terms of its implementation, in terms of its application, in terms of its coverage to the entire Hajj operation.\"\n\nThis year's pilgrimage is expected to run from June 14 till June 19.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news",

It's the pilgrims' choice to determine their time of travel.\"\n\nThis year, Saudi Arabia granted Bangladesh a quota of 127,000 pilgrims to perform the spiritual journey that is one of the five pillars of Islam. Because of the rising cost of airfares to the Middle East, fewer Bangladeshis than expected will be able to go.\n\nBangladesh, one of the most populous Muslim-majority countries, also struggled to meet the quota in 2023, when the minimum government rate for Hajj was $6,000.\n\nTo prevent the same scenario during the 2024 pilgrimage season, the Bangladeshi government reduced the cost by $1,000, but high inflation at home prevented a third of prospective pilgrims from registering.\n\n\"As we fell short of meeting the number, a quota of 41,000 is surrendered to Saudi Arabia,\" Islam said. \"The surrendering of this (remaining slots) will not affect the receiving of our Hajj quota next year.\"\n\nSaudi visa registration for Bangladeshis will end on Saturday, and most of them will be departing over the next few weeks from Dhaka, where they will be assisted by Saudi authorities under the flagship Makkah Route initiative.\n\nThe pre-travel program was launched by the Kingdom in 2019 to help pilgrims to meet all the visa, customs and health requirements at their airport of origin, and save them long hours of waiting before and upon arrival in Saudi Arabia.\n\nFrom Wednesday, those flying in the next few days can wait for departure at a special Hajj camp near the airport in Dhaka.\n\n\"While staying at the Hajj camp, the pilgrims have their Bangladeshi immigration part done. Also, a part of Saudi immigration is being done here as the pilgrims leave their luggage here to Makkah Route authorities,\" Islam said.\n\n\"The air-conditioned accommodation here is free of cost for the pilgrims ... We suggest the pilgrims from outside Dhaka be at the Hajj camp two days before their flight. The camp can hold more than 5,000 pilgrims at a time.\"", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazrat_Shahjalal_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Pillars_of_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Five Pillars of Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arab News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2024/05/08/4354111-785807885.jpeg?itok=aSFEs9li", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545215", "eventUri": "eng-9545215", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 331, "textEnd": 338}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 350, "textEnd": 357}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

It's the pilgrims' choice to determine their time of travel.\"\n\nThis year, Saudi Arabia granted Bangladesh a quota of 127,000 pilgrims to perform the spiritual journey that is one of the five pillars of Islam. Because of the rising cost of airfares to the Middle East, fewer Bangladeshis than expected will be able to go.\n\nBangladesh, one of the most populous Muslim-majority countries, also struggled to meet the quota in 2023, when the minimum government rate for Hajj was $6,000.\n\nTo prevent the same scenario during the 2024 pilgrimage season, the Bangladeshi government reduced the cost by $1,000, but high inflation at home prevented a third of prospective pilgrims from registering.\n\n\"As we fell short of meeting the number, a quota of 41,000 is surrendered to Saudi Arabia,\" Islam said. \"The surrendering of this (remaining slots) will not affect the receiving of our Hajj quota next year.\"\n\nSaudi visa registration for Bangladeshis will end on Saturday, and most of them will be departing over the next few weeks from Dhaka, where they will be assisted by Saudi authorities under the flagship Makkah Route initiative.\n\nThe pre-travel program was launched by the Kingdom in 2019 to help pilgrims to meet all the visa, customs and health requirements at their airport of origin, and save them long hours of waiting before and upon arrival in Saudi Arabia.\n\nFrom Wednesday, those flying in the next few days can wait for departure at a special Hajj camp near the airport in Dhaka.\n\n\"While staying at the Hajj camp, the pilgrims have their Bangladeshi immigration part done. Also, a part of Saudi immigration is being done here as the pilgrims leave their luggage here to Makkah Route authorities,\" Islam said.\n\n\"The air-conditioned accommodation here is free of cost for the pilgrims ...

Additionally, a complimentary Hajj SIM card with data and minutes ensures connectivity throughout the journey.\n\nThe mandatory Hujjaj App, designed to educate, track and assist pilgrims in performing Hajj obligations, reflects the ministry's commitment to facilitating a seamless pilgrimage experience.\n\nAddressing the Hajj supporting staff, including Mouvaineen, doctors, paramedics and seasonal staff, Nadeem Khan motivated them to deliver their best in extending maximum facilities to the guests of Allah Almighty arriving at the holy places of Makkah al-Mukarramah and Madinah Al-Munawarah in KSA.\n\nHe emphasized that their performance would be minutely evaluated, and no negligence would be tolerated.\n\nIn response to a question, Nadeem Khan said the ministry was gradually switching over its Hajj operation to end-to-end automation, and the launch of the Hajj app was one of its main features.\n\n\"We have completed 70-80% automation, and the rest will be done in due course.\" He said, adding currently 80-90 percent of intending pilgrims have been communicated through the Hajj App, shared information about their flights, accommodation, vaccination and visa approval.\n\nAll intending pilgrims, the director said, would be accommodated in residential buildings located in Markazia, from where Masjid e Nabvi and Roza-e-Rasool (SAW) are at just 15 to 20 minutes walking distance.\n\nAhmed Nadeem said over 8,000 Pakistanis have so far contacted the ministry through the Hajj app to discuss their issues regarding the spiritual journey, which have been cleared within no time, and a few are at various stages of resolution. \"So far, over 60,000 are active users of the Hajj App, while the number of intending pilgrims under the government scheme stands at 67,000-plus.\"\n\nApproximately 179,210 Pakistani pilgrims will perform their religious obligation under both government and private schemes, and the month-long pre-Hajj flight operation is slated to

This should not be due to harm,\" he said on Monday (6/5/2024).\n\nMuhammad Tonang said it was customary for pilgrims to bring home zamzam water and others in suitcases in the form of bottle packaging to supplement the quota of zamzam water in addition to the allotment allotment from the Ministry.\n\nIf carrying zamzam water in the form of a bottle or some kind in a suitcase is in addition to endangering the aviator, it will also be subject to a fine.\n\n\"For the fine or dam we do not yet know what the exact amount will be, but it is already regulated and this we want to convey to our pilgrims not to do it because the zamzam water distribution is from the Ministry,\" he said.\n\nHead of Hajj and Umrah Organization (PHU) Ministry Sulsel Ikbal Ismail added about Dam procurement or fines this year in his opinion ordered by the government.\n\nHe said the government had coordinated with slaughterhouses in Mecca to comply with sharia or stipulations that required a hajj who violated the provision would pay a fine.\n\n\"If those who leave are caught breaking will be subject to the Dam and it has been determined where to pay the fee. If there is a violation while returning home, there is also a team that handles it,\" he said.\n\nSulsel in 2024 will welcome 7,884 pilgrims who are candidates for Hajj.

In 2024, this sacred journey to Mecca not only continues its age-old religious importance but also significantly contributes to the travel industry, fostering global connectivity and cultural exchange. As we explore the multifaceted impacts of the Hajj pilgrimage on the travel sector, it becomes clear that this event is much more than a religious obligation -- it's a powerful driver of economic and cultural vitality.\n\nThe Hajj pilgrimage is one of the five pillars of Islam, required of all Muslims who are physically and financially able to undertake it at least once in their lifetimes. The pilgrimage occurs from the 8th to the 12th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Mecca, the holiest city for Muslims, hosts millions of pilgrims during this period. The rituals of Hajj include circling the Kaaba, walking between Safa and Marwah, and gathering at Mount Arafat, among others.\n\nThe Hajj pilgrimage in 2024 is expected to host an estimated 2.5 million pilgrims from around the globe. This influx of travelers provides a significant boost to various sectors of the economy, particularly the travel industry. Airlines, travel agencies, hospitality services, and local businesses in and around Mecca see a substantial increase in demand during the Hajj season.\n\nAirlines typically add special flights to their schedules to accommodate the surge in passengers traveling to Saudi Arabia. This not only increases revenue for airlines but also has a ripple effect across the global aviation industry, including airport services and ground handling. Hotels and other accommodations in Mecca and the neighboring cities also benefit immensely. From luxury hotels to modest lodgings, all see high occupancy rates, driving significant revenue during the Hajj period.\n\nSaudi Arabia has invested heavily in its infrastructure to better accommodate the growing number of pilgrims. The expansion of the Masjid al-Haram, the development of the Jeddah Metro, and the enhancement of the road and transport networks are prime examples. These improvements not only serve the pilgrims but also enhance the overall infrastructure of the region, benefiting local residents and future tourists alike.\n\nThe Hajj pilgrimage is a unique event that brings together people from diverse ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds. This gathering is one of the largest acts of religious tourism in the world and serves as a profound platform for cultural exchange and mutual understanding among Muslims from different parts of the globe.\n\nThe convergence of millions of pilgrims in Mecca offers a unique opportunity for the promotion of peace and global understanding. Pilgrims return home with experiences and stories that foster a greater appreciation of different cultures and perspectives, contributing to a more interconnected and harmonious world.\n\nLocal crafts and businesses in Mecca and the surrounding areas receive a substantial boost during the Hajj season. Artisans, retailers, and food vendors find an enormous market for their products, with pilgrims eager to bring back souvenirs and gifts for their families back home. This not only helps in preserving local crafts and traditions but also supports small businesses and the local economy.\n\nWhile the economic and cultural impacts of Hajj are largely positive, the massive influx of people also presents significant logistical and environmental challenges. Managing such a large crowd, ensuring their safety, and minimizing the environmental footprint are ongoing challenges for Saudi authorities. However, these challenges also present opportunities for innovation in crowd management, sustainable travel, and tourism practices.\n\nThe Hajj pilgrimage in 2024 is more than just a religious event; it is a significant contributor to the travel industry and a promoter of global cultural exchange. As it continues to evolve with technological and infrastructural advancements, Hajj not only enriches the spiritual lives of Muslims but also brings substantial economic and cultural benefits to the global community. By fostering understanding and connectivity among people of diverse backgrounds, Hajj stands as a beacon of peace and unity in our increasingly interconnected world.", "source": {"uri": "travelandtourworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Travel And Tour World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhu_al-Hijja", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhu al-Hijja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safa_and_Marwa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safa and Marwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Arafat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mount Arafat"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Pillars_of_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Five Pillars of Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kaaba"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mosque_of_Mecca", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Mosque of Mecca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah_Metro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeddah Metro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hospitality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religious tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrim", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pilgrim"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Religious_Tolerance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Religious Tolerance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mecca-66985_1280.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545215", "eventUri": "eng-9545215", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

This year 7008 persons from J&K are performing the holy pilgrimage. Reports say that around 6800 are going through the Srinagar embarkation, and remaining through the Delhi embarkation. The first batch of pilgrims is scheduled to leave from the Srinagar International Airport on May 9. The concerned authorities have been saying that all arrangements have been made for the sacred journey of the pilgrims from J&K to Saudi Arabia. It is being hoped that the required arrangements are in place in this connection and the pilgrims do not face any unnecessary inconvenience during the travel or the stay in Saudi Arabia. The pilgrims should be intimated well in advance about the time and date of departure from Srinagar and not on a short notice. There should not be any kind of confusion. In case of any problem or inconvenience during travel or in Saudi Arabia, the Hajj authorities of Jammu and Kashmir and the country should be responsive and must intervene at the time of need. The pleas and requests must not go unheard. There should be better coordination at various concerned government levels for smooth arrangements for the pilgrims. As per reports last year 12,052 pilgrims undertook the sacred journey from the Srinagar embarkation point. This year, initially, there was an allocated Hajj quota of 9,500 for J&K. Later, 2,000 seats were also added making the total allotment to 11,500. However, number of applicants was lesser than the allotted seats this year. Subsequently, all the applicants were accommodated without the need for a draw of lots. Reports say that the rising costs have resulted in a decline in the number of pilgrims this year. Each pilgrim has deposited over Rs 4.20 lakh for undertaking the pilgrimage. Now the pilgrims are set to embark on the holy journey from May 9. Authorities say they have coordinated every aspect of the journey, right from the issuance of boarding passes to customs clearance formalities. According to them, these arrangements have been put in place to minimise any inconvenience or delays during the travel process. The officials said that the Srinagar Hajj House, a dedicated facility, will serve as the central point for all necessary formalities related to the pilgrimage. Those accompanying the pilgrims to Hajj House must also cooperate with the concerned authorities to avoid any kind of inconvenience or confusion.

He further added that the Islamic Ministry is also in communication with key figures of the Hajj and Umrah Ministry in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe current allocated Hajj quota for Maldivians is 1,000 per year. The Maldivian government's request is to double this amount, and allow 2,000 Maldivians to go on Hajj annually.\n\nMinister Shaheem explained that although the allocated quota was previously increased at the behest of the Maldivian government, it is now done through proper planning. One aspect the Saudi government takes into consideration is the available bed capacity at the three prominent locations of the pilgrimage, Mina, Arafat and Mecca.\n\nHe further added that the Minister of Hajj and Umrah Tawfig F. AlRabiah assured to prioritise Maldives when distributing unoccupied Hajj applications from countries which receive larger quotas.\n\n\"For example, one country may receive [a quota of] 500,000 people. The [quota] is allocated based on the country's population. Countries which receive quotas of 300,000 or 100,000 do not utilise that exact amount. Due to various economic reasons, people are unable to go to Hajj and the spots are left unoccupied. For example 50,000 people utilised the quota of a country which was set at 100,000. The remaining amount is unused. The left over slots are distributed [to countries] based on the amount they have requested for,\" the minister explained in detail.\n\nHowever, he said that a confirmation would only be received towards the Hajj dates.\n\n\".. when the situation presents itself, [they said] they will give priority to the Maldives as well. I hope that there will be some sort of an increase. That increase will come very close [to the Hajj dates]. There is a possiblity of some increase. [We] hope for that,\" he said.\n\nContrary to previous administrations, President Dr Mohamed Muizzu's government has taken back all the Hajj quota slots from private groups which previously arranged Hajj trips for locals.

Violators can be jailed for up to six months and fined a hefty 50,000\n\nSaudi Arabia's Ministry of Interior announced a significant tightening of regulations for the upcoming Hajj pilgrimage. The new measures target both pilgrims lacking proper permits and those who assist them.\n\nAnyone caught transporting unauthorized individuals attempting Hajj faces stiff penalties. Violators can be jailed for up to six months and fined a hefty 50,000 Saudi Riyals (roughly $13,333).\n\nThe Ministry emphasized that being present in designated areas during Hajj without a valid permit is a serious offense. This applies to everyone, regardless of residency status - citizens, residents, and visitors alike. The penalty for such a transgression is a 10,000 Saudi Riyal ($2,667) fine. Furthermore, residents caught flouting the rules face deportation and a subsequent ban on re-entering the Kingdom for a period determined by law.\n\nRepeat offenders should be particularly wary. The Ministry has adopted a zero-tolerance approach, warning of even harsher punishments for those caught a second time. These may include imprisonment, fines, and even vehicle confiscation.\n\nThe new regulations will be strictly enforced across Mecca, the surrounding Central Zone, holy sites, the Haramain train station in Rusaifah, security checkpoints, sorting facilities, and temporary security stations. The enforcement period begins on June 2, 2024 and runs until June 20, 2024.\n\nThis stricter enforcement comes on the heels of a recent announcement by Saudi authorities requiring all expatriates to obtain permits before entering Mecca. The new rule, which began on May 4, 2024 prohibits entry for those without the necessary authorization.\n\nA statement released by the General Security emphasized the importance of organized procedures for the Hajj pilgrimage. It outlined that starting May 4, 2024, expatriates must secure permission from the relevant authorities before entering the holy city. Security checkpoints will bar entry to anyone lacking a permit.\n\nThe General Security, through the official Saudi Press Agency, reiterated the strict enforcement of all Hajj regulations for 1445 AH. This includes the repatriation of vehicles and any expatriates found working in the holy sites without the proper permits. These permits can be issued by the competent authority, or individuals can present a resident ID from Mecca, a valid Umrah permit, or a Hajj permit.\n\nThe pilgrimage to Mecca, birthplace of Islam, forms one of the five pillars of Islam and must be performed by all Muslims who have the means to complete it.\n\nThe Hajj this year will fall between June 2nd and June 20th.

Valuable time is therefore, dedicated to managing the crisis instead of fixing the onerous task of serving pilgrims.\n\n\"While we appreciate the role of leadership and guidance of the Amirul teams, there are instances when the Amirul Hajj teams usurped the critical operational responsibilities of state Muslim pilgrims' welfare board officials, especially in the areas of airlift schedule and the allocation of accommodation to pilgrims.

Dr. Al-Sanad highlighted the importance of considering destination-specific vaccinations based on the pilgrim's point of arrival to safeguard their health and well-being.\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Al-Sanad stressed the significance of assessing the physical capabilities of pilgrims, particularly the elderly and those with chronic medical conditions such as cancer, heart disease, respiratory ailments, liver disorders, or advanced kidney disease. Pilgrims are urged to consult their healthcare provider before embarking on their journey to verify their health status and ensure they carry necessary medical reports and medications, securely packaged and accompanied by personal and health-related information.\n\nTo facilitate a smooth and safe Hajj experience, Dr. Al-Sanad recommended pilgrims receive vaccinations at least 10 days before departure and seek guidance from healthcare providers at preventive health centers on preventive measures against respiratory infections, waterborne diseases, food-related illnesses, and heat-related ailments.

It involves travelling to holy cities in Saudi Arabia like Mecca and Medina for about two to four weeks. During Hajj, pilgrims have to walk long distances and camp in tents in places like Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifa. They also have to spend a lot of time standing and praying in Arafat. Because there are so many people, even simple tasks during Hajj can take a long time.\n\nBut Hajj can be tough on the body. Many older people who go on Hajj have health issues like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease, which can get worse during the journey. The weather is usually really hot, around 37 to 45 degrees Celsius, and with so many people around, it can be crowded and uncomfortable. Plus, when you're in a new place with different weather, food, and habits, it can affect your health. During Hajj, people are focused on religious rituals, so they might not take care of themselves as well as they should. This, along with language barriers, can make it hard to get medical help if you need it. Some common health problems during Hajj include chest infections, diarrhoea, dehydration, heart issues, and some contagious diseases.\n\nDiabetes and Hajj\n\nManagement of patients with diabetes whose care depends on a stable routine is affected significantly. The following health risks may be encountered in people with diabetes:\n\nLow blood glucose\n\nLow blood glucose is always a risk during Hajj. It is because of unusually excessive physical activity, smaller meals, deviation from routine timing of meals, preference for performing prayer in the holy shrines (which may be quite away from the residence) may delay meal times. Excessive heat during the summer season may increase insulin absorption. Difference in insulin preparations between Saudi Arabia (available as 100-unit vials) and India (available as 40-unit vials) resulting in overdose if 100-unit insulin is given with 40-unit syringe.\n\nLack of adequate insulin or intercurrent illness can increase blood glucose. In order to avoid this, continue to take insulin or diabetes medications, test blood glucose regularly, if it is >250(especially in type 1 diabetes), test for urine or blood ketones. If one feels sick, he/she should take some carbohydrate-containing drink as suggested above. If one still feels unwell, contact the healthcare team.\n\nDehydration\n\nTake plenty of water (at least 8 glasses) during the day and carry water bottles with you all the time. Avoid caffeine or sugary drinks. If possible, carry an umbrella with you and use frequent water spray to keep one cool. In case of diarrhoea, consult the medical team for quick management of dehydration.\n\nFoot infections and ulcers\n\nIn summer months, ground temperature may go above 50 to 60 degrees Celsius; temperature may be further high on hot marble. Walking barefoot in hot temperatures can cause burn injuries. In addition, cracks can develop in soles due to dry weather and hot temperature. Minor injuries to toes can also develop during Tawaf from stamping. Following measures will prevent foot problems:\n\nKidney and heart disease\n\nThere is a high risk of kidney diseases among patients with diabetes performing the rituals of Hajj.

This law has always been there for a long time.\n\n\"Even though some pilgrims breached it in the past, this time around, we will make sure pregnant women never travel.\n\n\"Saudi authorities have also warned us against allowing pregnant women to travel. In fact, they threatened to fine us if we went against the law,\" Arabi said.\n\nHe then enjoined state pilgrim welfare boards, agencies and commissions to ensure that pregnant women, at whatever stage of their pregnancy, were prevented from embarking on the religious journey for their safety and that of their unborn babies.", "source": {"uri": "tribuneonlineng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribune Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "saliu_gbadamosi@tribuneonlineng.com", "name": "Saliu Gbadamosi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hausa people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Ahmadu_Bello_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sir Ahmadu Bello International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Peace", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air Peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flynas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebbi_State", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kebbi State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kebbi State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birnin_Kebbi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birnin Kebbi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birnin Kebbi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_system_of_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal system of Saudi Arabia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Abdulaziz_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King Abdulaziz International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NAHCON.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545215", "eventUri": "eng-9545215", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 1095, "textEnd": 1101}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Saleh Al-Jasser announced that the pilgrims will have the unique experience of benefiting from the service of flying taxis and drones during this year's Hajj season. \"These represent highly advanced modes of transportation including taxi applications. There is a race between many specialized companies in the transport sector to provide the best means of transport over the coming years,\" he said.\n\nAl-Jasser said this in a press briefing after receiving the first batch of foreign pilgrims at Prince Muhammad bin Abdulaziz International Airport in Madinah on Thursday morning. \"It is necessary to learn about these technologies and the appropriate environment for operating such modes of transport in such seasons, and we will be at the forefront to benefit from these services,\" he said adding that the Hajj season will have the largest chunk of such modes of transport.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Al-Jasser said last year that flying taxis would be tested during the Hajj season in the coming years. Earlier, Saudi Arabian Airlines also unveiled plans to operate flying taxis to ferry Hajj pilgrims between King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah and hotels in Makkah. Saudia intends to buy around 100 aircraft to operate the service.\n\nDuring last January, Abdullah Al-Shahrani, director of corporate communications and spokesman of the Saudia Group, said that the Saudi national carrier is making preparations to use air taxis as a new mode of transportation during the Hajj season. He said that the Saudia Group has contracted the purchase of 100 Lilium jets, German electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, to shuttle between the Jeddah airport and airstrips in Makkah hotels near the Grand Mosque and other holy places.\n\n\"The electric plane Lilium is one of the first aircraft that operates entirely on electric power. After completing the necessary arrangements, these planes will fly with the guests of God during Hajj and Umrah seasons from King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah to the airstrips in hotels near the Grand Mosque in Makkah,\" he said. Air taxi is a small commercial aircraft that makes short flights on demand.", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Gazette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Gazette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_bin_Abdulaziz_Al_Saud", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Saud", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ibn Saud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mosque_of_Mecca", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Mosque of Mecca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_taxi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air taxi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_of_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abdullah of Saudi Arabia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Abdulaziz_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King Abdulaziz International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "VTOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umrah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2024/05/09/2383950.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545215", "eventUri": "eng-9545215", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

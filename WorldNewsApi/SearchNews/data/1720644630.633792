Residents told PREMIUM TIMES that the three-storey building collapsed on Friday. One of the residents, Onyeka Egbule, told this newspaper that the building was still under construction when it collapsed. \u201cFive people were working yesterday (Friday) when the building collapsed on them,\u201d Mr Egbule, whose apartment is located a few miles from the building, said. He, however, could not say if the workers had died. Another resident, simply identified as Jude, claimed three of the carpenters working on the building\u2019s roof survived the collapse. But he could not explain the whereabouts of the survivors. This newspaper gathered that the owner of the building is based outside Nigeria, but had asked his siblings in Nigeria to supervise the project. There are speculations that the use of substandard building materials might have contributed to the collapse. But PREMIUM TIMES could not independently verify the speculations.

He said the Abia State Government mobilised trucks and other equipment during the rescue operation.

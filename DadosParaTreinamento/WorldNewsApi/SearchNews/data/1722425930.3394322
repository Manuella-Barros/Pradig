{"id": 243256260, "title": "Italian scrum will provide big test for Ireland U-20s in World Cup opener", "text": "At the opposite end of the country to where Andy Farrell\u2019s men are based ahead of their two-Test series against the Springboks, the Ireland U-20s are in Cape Town to begin their quest to become the first Irish side to win this tournament. Following last year\u2019s second appearance in the final, which came after the historic feat in 2016, Willie Faloon\u2019s young side will be hoping to go one better this time around, but they face a huge challenge. Italy caused Ireland major problems in Cork during the Six Nations, particularly at scrum time. With that in mind, the Irish front-row of Jacob Boyd, Danny Sheahan and Patreece Bell will hope to provide set-piece solidity. Knowing another two tough tests against Georgia and Australia lie ahead, Ireland will be eager to lay down an early marker of their title credentials. If the pack can supply a clean platform for quick ball, this Irish backline has already shown that it has the firepower to score tries. Former underage Cork GAA star Ben O\u2019Connor has another chance to shine, having shown glimpses of his potential earlier in the year. The full-back is part of a back-three that includes Davy Colbert and Hugo McLaughlin, and while the absence of Ulster Academy-bound centre Wilhelm de Klerk is a blow, the return of Sam Berman is a welcome boost, as he links up with Finn Treacy in midfield, with his Connacht team-mate Hugh Gavin to call upon from a bench that also includes debutant scrum-half Jake O\u2019Riordan. Marco Scalabrin is a big threat out wide for Italy, while ex-Munster prop Freddie Pucciariello\u2019s son Martino starts at out-half and will be tasked with getting his winger on the ball. Ireland, though, are good enough to shut them down and get their campaign off to a positive start.

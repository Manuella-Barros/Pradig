"ISTANBUL: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday opened for worship a mosque converted from an ancient Orthodox church in Istanbul, four years after he ordered its transformation.\n\nIn 2020, Erdogan ordered the building -- which was a Byzantine church, then a mosque and then a museum -- to be converted into a Muslim place of worship one month after a similarly controversial ruling on the Unesco-protected Hagia Sophia.\n\nGet exclusive content with Gulf News WhatsApp channel\n\nIstanbul's Hagia Sophia is an ancient cathedral that was converted into a mosque and then a museum, before becoming a mosque again.\n\nBoth changes show Erdogan's efforts to galvanise his more conservative and nationalist supporters.\n\nBut they add to Turkey's problems with prelates in both the Orthodox and Catholic churches.\n\nErdogan on Monday remotely opened Kariye Mosque for worship after four years of restoration, during a ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital, Ankara.\n\nThe decision in 2020 to convert it drew an angry response from neighbouring Greece, which called the move \"yet another provocation against religious persons everywhere\".\n\nThe Holy Saviour in Chora was a Byzantine church decorated with 14th-century frescoes of the Last Judgement that are still treasured by Christians.\n\nThe church was converted into Kariye Mosque half a century after the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks.\n\nIt became the Kariye Museum after World War II, when Turkey sought to create a more secular republic from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nA group of art historians from the United States helped restore the original church's mosaics and they were put on public display in 1958.\n\nHagia Sophia - once the seat of Eastern Christianity - was also converted into a mosque by the Ottomans.\n\nAtaturk, the founder of modern Turkey after World War I, turned the UNESCO World Heritage site into a museum in a bid to promote religious neutrality.\n\nNearly 100 years later, Erdogan, whose ruling AKP party has Islamic roots, turned it back into a Muslim place of worship.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType":

The building, which is under the ownership of the General Directorate of Foundations, was converted from a museum into a mosque by a presidential decree in August 2020.\n\nThe building went under restoration after remaining open for worship for a short time.\n\nOriginally a church during the Byzantine Empire and later a mosque during the Ottoman Empire, Chora has been a symbol of \u0130stanbul's rich cultural tapestry. The structure, known for its stunning mosaics and frescoes, was first built as a monastery in 534 during the reign of Emperor Justinian I and has undergone numerous renovations over the centuries.\n\nThe decision to convert Chora into a mosque came shortly after a similar transformation of the iconic Hagia Sophia, which had also been turned into a museum during the secularization efforts in the early years of the republic.\n\nThe reopening of Chora as a mosque was part of a larger initiative by the government to restore and reopen 201 historical structures to mark the Foundations Week.\n\nDuring a ceremony at the Presidential Complex, President Erdo\u011fan emphasized the significance of these restorations, stating, \"In the last 21 years, we have revived 5,500 ancestral heritage sites within our country and across our heartland geography.\"\n\nLocated in the Edirnekap\u0131 neighborhood of \u0130stanbul's Fatih district, the Chora Mosque's current form is the result of restorations during the Ottoman era and the second half of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1511, the structure was converted into a mosque by Atik Ali Pasha, the grand vizier of Sultan Bayezid II, and became known as the \"Atik Ali Pasha Mosque\" or \"Chora (Kariye) Mosque.\" During this period, the original church's mosaics and frescoes were plastered over.

Constantinople in 1453 by the Ottoman Turks.\n\nIt became the Kariye Museum after World War II, when Turkey sought to create a more secular republic from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nA group of art historians from the United States helped restore the church's original mosaics and they were put on public display in 1958.\n\nHagia Sophia, once the seat of Eastern Christianity, was also transformed into a mosque by the Ottomans.\n\nAtat\u00fcrk, the founder of modern Turkey after World War I, transformed this UNESCO World Heritage site into a museum in an effort to promote religious neutrality.\n\nNearly 100 years later, Erdogan, whose ruling AKP party has Islamic roots, transformed it into a Muslim place of worship.\n\n\"It's timeless, it's something that for me is superior to Hagia Sophia,\" Michel said of the Kariye Mosque.\n\n\"It's better preserved, less touristy and more intimate.\"", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"},

Both are listed as UN World Heritage Sites.\n\nLike Haghia Sophia, which was a church for centuries and then a mosque for centuries more, the Chora had operated as a museum for decades before it was ordered turned into a mosque. The Chora's formal launch as a mosque, however, was delayed as the structure then underwent restoration.\n\nAlso Read | Srinivasa Ramanujan Death Anniversary Date: Know All About the Great Indian Mathematician Who Tragically Passed Away at the Age of 32.\n\nErdogan on Monday remotely presided over a ceremony marking the opening of the Chora -- as well as other recently-restored structures -- from a conference hall at his palace complex in Ankara.\n\n\"May it bring good fortune,\" Erdogan said during the televised event.\n\nMusa Tombul was among the first worshippers to pray inside.\n\n\"I have been waiting for its opening for four years,\" he told the state-run Anadolu Agency. \"I was honoured to pray in such a place.\"\n\n\"We thank God for showing us these days,\" Anadolu quoted another worshiper, Haydar Senbahar, as saying. \"Hopefully, we will come here from time to time and perform our prayers.\"\n\nThe church, situated near Istanbul's ancient city walls, is famed for its elaborate mosaics and frescoes. It dates to the fourth century, although the edifice took on its current form in the 11th-12th centuries.\n\nThe structure served as a mosque during Ottoman rule before being transformed into a museum in 1945.\n\nGreece had criticised the Turkish government's decision to turn it back into a mosque, accusing Ankara of \"insulting the character\" of another World Heritage Site.\n\nThe decisions to transform Haghia Sophia and the Chora back into mosques were seen as moves geared to consolidate the conservative and religious support base of Erdogan's ruling party amid an economic downturn.\n\nIn 2020, Erdogan joined hundreds of worshippers for the first Muslim prayers in Hagia Sophia in 86 years, brushing aside international criticism and calls for the monument to be kept as a museum. As many as 350,000 took part in the prayers outside the structure.

scorching temperatures this year.\n\nAt least 323 of those who died were Egyptians, most of them succumbing to heat-related illnesses, two Arab diplomats coordinating their countries' responses told AFP.\n\n\"All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat\" except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, one of the diplomats said, adding the total figure came from the hospital morgue in the Al-Muaisem neighborhood of Mecca.\n\nREAD: Hajj pilgrimage ends amid deadly Saudi heat spike\n\nAt least 60 Jordanians also died, the diplomats said, up from an official tally of 41 given earlier on Tuesday by Amman.\n\nThe new deaths bring the total reported so far by multiple countries to 577, according to an AFP tally.\n\nThe diplomats said the total at the morgue in Al-Muaisem, one of the biggest in Mecca, was 550.\n\nThe hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once.\n\nREAD: Hajj pilgrims 'stone the devil' as Muslims mark Eid al-Adha\n\nThe pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month that said temperatures in the area where rituals are performed were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nTemperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday, the Saudi national meteorology centre said.\n\nHeat stress\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Egypt's foreign ministry said Cairo was collaborating with Saudi authorities on search operations for Egyptians who had gone missing during the hajj.\n\nWhile a ministry statement said \"a certain number of deaths\" had occurred, it did not specify whether Egyptians were among them.\n\nSaudi authorities have reported treating more than 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress but have not updated that figure since Sunday and have not provided information on fatalities.\n\nAt least 240 pilgrims were reported dead by various countries last year, most of them Indonesians.\n\nAFP journalists in Mina, outside Mecca, on Monday saw pilgrims pouring bottles of water over their heads as volunteers handed out cold drinks and fast-melting chocolate ice cream to help them keep cool.\n\nSaudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nBut many of the hajj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime.\n\nSome pilgrims described seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and ambulance services that appeared overwhelmed at times.\n\nAround 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the hajj this year, 1.6 million of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities.\n\nUnregistered pilgrims\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly procedures for official hajj visas.\n\nThis places these off-the-books pilgrims at risk as they cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the hajj route.\n\nOne of the diplomats who spoke to AFP on Tuesday said that the Egyptian death toll was \"absolutely\" boosted by a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims.\n\n\"Irregular pilgrims caused great chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims' camps, causing the collapse of services,\" said an Egyptian official supervising the country's hajj mission.\n\n\"The pilgrims went without food, water, or air conditioning for a long time.\"\n\nThey died \"from the heat because most people had no place\" to take shelter.\n\nEarlier this month, Saudi officials said they had cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca ahead of the hajj.\n\nOther countries to report deaths during the hajj this year include Indonesia, Iran and Senegal.\n\nMost countries have not specified how many deaths were heat-related.\n\nSaudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel said on Tuesday that health plans for the hajj had \"been successfully carried out\", preventing major outbreaks of disease and other public health threats, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.\n\nHealth officials \"provided virtual consultations to over 5,800 pilgrims, primarily for heat-related illnesses, enabling prompt intervention and mitigating

coordinating their countries' responses told AFP.\n\n\"All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat\" except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, one of the diplomats said, adding the total figure came from the hospital morgue in the Al-Muaisem neighborhood of Mecca.\n\nAt least 60 Jordanians also died, the diplomats said, up from an official tally of 41 given earlier on Tuesday by Amman.\n\nThe new deaths bring the total reported so far by multiple countries to 577, according to an AFP tally.\n\nThe diplomats said the total at the morgue in Al-Muaisem, one of the biggest in Mecca, was 550.\n\nThe hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once.\n\nThe pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month that said temperatures in the area where rituals are performed were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nTemperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday, the Saudi national meteorology centre said.\n\nHeat stress\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Egypt's foreign ministry said Cairo was collaborating with Saudi authorities on search operations for Egyptians who had gone missing during the hajj.\n\nWhile a ministry statement said \"a certain number of deaths\" had occurred, it did not specify whether Egyptians were among them.\n\nSaudi authorities have reported treating more than 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress but have not updated that figure since Sunday and have not provided information on fatalities.\n\nAt least 240 pilgrims were reported dead by various countries last year, most of them Indonesians.\n\nAFP journalists in Mina, outside Mecca, on Monday saw pilgrims pouring bottles of water over their heads as volunteers handed out cold drinks and fast-melting chocolate ice cream to help them keep cool.\n\nSaudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nBut many of the hajj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime.\n\nSome pilgrims described seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and ambulance services that appeared overwhelmed at times.\n\nAround 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the hajj this year, 1.6 million of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities.\n\nUnregistered pilgrims\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly procedures for official hajj visas.\n\nThis places these off-the-books pilgrims at risk as they cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the hajj route.\n\nOne of the diplomats who spoke to AFP on Tuesday said that the Egyptian death toll was \"absolutely\" boosted by a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims.\n\n\"Irregular pilgrims caused great chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims' camps, causing the collapse of services,\" said an Egyptian official supervising the country's hajj mission.\n\n\"The pilgrims went without food, water, or air conditioning for a long time.\"\n\nThey died \"from the heat because most people had no place\" to take

have shown that the pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change.\n\nDIPLOMATS HAVE SAID at least 550 pilgrims died during the hajj, underscoring the gruelling nature of the pilgrimage which again unfolded in scorching temperatures this year.\n\nAt least 323 of those who died were Egyptians, most of them succumbing to heat-related illnesses, two Arab diplomats coordinating their countries' responses told AFP.\n\n\"All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat\", except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, one of the diplomats said, adding the total figure came from the hospital morgue in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood of Mecca.\n\nAt least 60 Jordanians also died, the diplomats said, up from an official tally of 41 given earlier on yesterday by Amman.\n\nThe new deaths bring the total reported so far by multiple countries to 577, according to an AFP tally.\n\nThe diplomats said the total at the morgue in Al-Muaisem, one of the biggest in Mecca, was 550.\n\nThe hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once.\n\nThe pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month that said temperatures in the area where rituals are performed were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius each decade.\n\nTemperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125

authorities on search operations for Egyptians who had gone missing during the hajj.\n\nWhile a ministry statement said \"a certain number of deaths\" had occurred, it did not specify whether Egyptians were among them.\n\nSaudi authorities have reported treating more than 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress but have not updated that figure since Sunday and have not provided information on fatalities.\n\nAt least 240 pilgrims were reported dead by various countries last year, most of them Indonesians.\n\nAFP journalists in Mina, outside Mecca, on Monday saw pilgrims pouring bottles of water over their heads as volunteers handed out cold drinks and fast-melting chocolate ice cream to help them keep cool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nBut many of the hajj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime.\n\nSome pilgrims described seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and ambulance services that appeared overwhelmed at times.\n\nAround 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the hajj this year, 1.6 million of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities.\n\nUnregistered pilgrims\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly procedures for official hajj visas.\n\nThis places these off-the-books pilgrims at risk as they cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the hajj route.\n\nOne of the diplomats who spoke to AFP yesterday said that the Egyptian death toll was \"absolutely\" boosted by a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims.\n\n\"Irregular pilgrims caused great chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims' camps, causing the collapse of services,\" said an Egyptian official supervising the country's hajj mission.\n\n\"The pilgrims went without food, water, or air conditioning for a long time.\"\n\nThey died \"from the heat because most people had no place\" to take shelter.\n\nEarlier this month, Saudi officials said they had cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca ahead of the hajj.\n\nOther countries to report deaths during the hajj this year include Indonesia, Iran and Senegal.\n\nMost countries have not specified how many deaths were heat-related.\n\nSaudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel said on Tuesday that health plans for the hajj had \"been successfully carried out\", preventing major outbreaks of disease and other public health threats, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.\n\nHealth officials \"provided virtual consultations to over 5,800 pilgrims, primarily for heat-related illnesses, enabling prompt intervention and mitigating the potential for a surge in cases,\" SPA said.", "source":

Earlier this month, Saudi officials said they had cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca ahead of the hajj.\n\nOther countries to report deaths during the hajj this year include Indonesia, Iran and Senegal. Most countries have not specified how many deaths were heat-related. Saudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel said on Tuesday that health plans for the hajj had 'been successfully carried out', preventing major outbreaks of disease and other public health threats, the official Saudi Press Agency reported. Health officials 'provided virtual consultations to over 5,800 pilgrims, primarily for heat-related illnesses, enabling prompt intervention and mitigating the potential for a surge in cases,' SPA said.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

pilgrims died during hajj, mostly Egyptians", "body": "Riyadh (AFP) - Diplomats said on Tuesday that at least 550 pilgrims died during the hajj, underscoring the gruelling nature of the pilgrimage which again unfolded in scorching temperatures this year.\n\nAt least 323 of those who died were Egyptians, most of them succumbing to heat-related illnesses, the two Arab diplomats coordinating their countries' responses told AFP.\n\n\"All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat\" except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, one of the diplomats said, adding the total figure came from the hospital morgue in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood of Mecca.\n\nAt least 60 Jordanians also died, the diplomats said, up from an official tally of 41 given earlier on Tuesday by Amman.\n\nThe new deaths bring the total reported so far by multiple countries to 577, according to an AFP tally.\n\nThe diplomats said the total at the morgue in Al-Muaisem, one of the biggest in Mecca, was 550.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Egypt's foreign ministry said Cairo was collaborating with Saudi authorities on search operations for Egyptians who had gone missing during the hajj.\n\nWhile a ministry statement said \"a certain number of deaths\" had occurred, it did not specify whether Egyptians were among them.\n\nSaudi authorities have reported treating more than 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress but have not updated that figure since Sunday and have not provided information on fatalities.\n\nAt least 240 pilgrims were reported dead by various countries last year, most of them Indonesians.\n\nSun exposure\n\nThe hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once.\n\nThe pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month that said temperatures in the area where rituals are performed were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nTemperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday, the Saudi national meteorology centre said.\n\nAFP journalists in Mina, outside Mecca, on Monday saw pilgrims pouring bottles of water over their heads as volunteers handed out cold drinks and fast-melting chocolate ice cream to help them keep cool.\n\nSaudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nBut many of the hajj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime.\n\nSome pilgrims described seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and ambulance services that appeared overwhelmed at times.\n\nAround 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the hajj this year, 1.6 million of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities.\n\nUnregistered pilgrims\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj without securing official hajj visas in order to save money, a more dangerous undertaking because these off-the-books pilgrims cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the hajj route.\n\nOne of the diplomats who spoke to AFP on Tuesday said that the Egyptian death toll was \"absolutely\" boosted by a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims.\n\nEarlier this month, Saudi officials said they had cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca ahead of the hajj.\n\nOther countries to report deaths during the hajj this year include Indonesia, Iran and Senegal.\n\nMost countries have not specified how many deaths were heat-related.\n\nHosting the hajj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's title includes \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\" in the cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\nSaudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel said on Tuesday that health plans for the hajj had \"been successfully carried out\", preventing major outbreaks of disease and other public health threats, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.\n\nA virtual hospital \"provided virtual

were Egyptians, most of them succumbing to heat-related illnesses, two Arab diplomats coordinating their countries' responses told AFP.\n\n\"All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat\" except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, one of the diplomats said, adding the total figure came from the hospital morgue in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood of Mecca.\n\nAt least 60 Jordanians also died, the diplomats said, up from an official tally of 41 given earlier on Tuesday by Amman.\n\nThe new deaths bring the total reported so far by multiple countries to 577,

during the hajj.\n\nWhile a ministry statement said \"a certain number of deaths\" had occurred, it did not specify whether Egyptians were among them.\n\nSaudi authorities have reported treating more than 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress but have not updated that figure since Sunday and have not provided information on fatalities.\n\nAt least 240 pilgrims were reported dead by various countries last year, most of them Indonesians.\n\nAFP journalists in Mina, outside Mecca, on Monday saw pilgrims pouring bottles of water over their heads as volunteers handed out cold drinks and fast-melting chocolate ice cream to help them keep cool.\n\nSaudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nMore from this section Rates of Problem Marijuana Use Are Rising Among Seniors NYPD: 3 men shot in Williamsbridge, suspect at large Disability Rights Groups Demand Standard Accessibility Rules

least 550 Hajj pilgrims die in scorching 50C heat in Mecca", "body": "Diplomats on Tuesday said at least 550 pilgrims died during the hajj, underscoring the gruelling nature of the pilgrimage which again unfolded in scorching temperatures this year.\n\nAt least 323 of those who died were Egyptians, most of them succumbing to heat-related illnesses, two Arab diplomats coordinating their countries' responses revealed.\n\n'All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat' except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, one of the diplomats said, adding the total figure came from the hospital morgue in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood of Mecca.\n\nAt least 60 Jordanians also died, the diplomats said, up from an official tally of 41 given earlier on Tuesday by Amman.\n\nThe new deaths bring the total reported so far by multiple countries to 577.\n\nDiplomats on Tuesday said at least 550 pilgrims died during the hajj, underscoring the gruelling nature of the pilgrimage\n\nTemperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday\n\nThe pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month\n\nThe diplomats said the total at the morgue in Al-Muaisem, one of the biggest in Mecca, was 550.\n\nThe hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once.\n\nThe pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month that said temperatures in the area where rituals are performed were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nTemperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday, the Saudi national meteorology centre said.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Egypt's foreign ministry said Cairo was collaborating with Saudi authorities on search operations for Egyptians who had gone missing during the hajj.\n\nWhile a ministry statement said 'a certain number of deaths' had occurred, it did not specify whether Egyptians were among them.\n\nSaudi authorities have reported treating more than 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress but have not updated that figure since Sunday and have not provided information on fatalities.\n\nAt least 240 pilgrims were reported dead by various countries last year, most of them Indonesians.\n\nThe hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once\n\nWhile a ministry statement said 'a certain number of deaths' had occurred, it did not specify whether Egyptians were among them\n\nAFP journalists in Mina, outside Mecca, on Monday saw pilgrims pouring bottles of water over their heads as volunteers handed out cold drinks and fast-melting chocolate ice cream to help them keep cool.\n\nSaudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nBut many of the hajj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime.\n\nSome pilgrims described seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and ambulance services that appeared overwhelmed at times.\n\nAround 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the hajj this year, 1.6 million of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities.\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly procedures for official hajj visas.\n\nThis places these off-the-books pilgrims at risk as they cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the hajj route.\n\nOne of the diplomats who spoke to AFP on Tuesday said that the Egyptian death toll was 'absolutely' boosted by a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims.\n\nAround 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the hajj this year, 1.6 million of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities.\n\nMuslim pilgrims use umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun as they arrive to cast stones at pillars in the symbolic stoning of the devil, the last rite of the annual hajj\n\n'Irregular pilgrims caused great chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims' camps, causing the collapse of services,' said an Egyptian official supervising the country's hajj mission.\n\n'The pilgrims went without food, water, or air conditioning for a long time.'\n\nThey died 'from the heat because most people had no place' to take shelter.\n\nEarlier this month, Saudi officials said they had cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca ahead of the hajj.\n\nOther countries to report deaths during the hajj this year include Indonesia, Iran and Senegal.\n\nMost countries have not specified how many deaths were heat-related.\n\nSaudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel said on Tuesday that health plans for the hajj had 'been successfully carried out', preventing major outbreaks of disease and other public health threats, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.\n\nHealth officials 'provided virtual consultations to over 5,800 pilgrims, primarily for heat-related illnesses, enabling prompt intervention and mitigating the potential for a surge in cases,' SPA said.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

Saudi Arabia on June 17 warned of a temperature spike in Mecca as Muslim pilgrims wrapped up the hajj in searing conditions, with more than a dozen heat-related deaths confirmed. Agence France-Presse\n\nRIYADH -- Friends and family searched for missing hajj pilgrims on Wednesday as the death toll at the annual rituals, which were carried out in scorching heat, surged past 900.\n\nRelatives scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst after temperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) in Mecca, Islam's holiest city, on Monday.\n\nAbout 1.8 million people from all over the world, many old and infirm, took part in the days-long, mostly outdoor pilgrimage, which this year fell during the oven-like Saudi summer.\n\nREAD: Diplomats say at least 550 pilgrims died during hajj, mostly Egyptians\n\nAn Arab diplomat told AFP that deaths among Egyptians alone had jumped to \"at least 600\", from more than 300 a day earlier, mostly from the unforgiving heat.\n\nThat figure brought the total reported dead so far to 922, according to an AFP tally of figures released by various countries.\n\nThe diplomat later added that Egyptian officials in Saudi Arabia had received \"1,400 reports of missing pilgrims\", including the 600 dead.\n\nMabrouka bint Salem Shushana of Tunisia, in her early 70s, has been missing since the climax of the pilgrimage on Saturday at Mount Arafat, her husband Mohammed told AFP on Wednesday.\n\nREAD: Hajj pilgrims 'stone the devil' as Muslims mark Eid al-Adha\n\nBecause she was unregistered and did not have an official hajj permit, she was unable to access air-conditioned facilities that allow pilgrims to cool down, he said.\n\n\"She's an old lady. She was tired. She was feeling so hot, and she had no place to sleep,\" he said. \"I looked for her in all the hospitals. Until now I don't have a clue.\"\n\nFacebook and other social media networks have been flooded with pictures of the missing and requests for information.\n\nThose searching for news include family and friends of Ghada Mahmoud Ahmed Dawood, an Egyptian pilgrim unaccounted for since Saturday.\n\n\"I received a call from her daughter in Egypt begging me to put any post on Facebook that can help track her or find her,\" said one family friend based in Saudi Arabia, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to anger Saudi authorities.\n\n\"The good news is that until now we did not find her on the list of the dead people, which gives us hope she is still alive.\"\n\nSearing heat\n\nThe hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once.\n\nIts timing is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, shifting forward each year in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nFor the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer.\n\nAccording to a Saudi study published last month, temperatures in the area are rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nIn addition to Egypt, fatalities have also been confirmed by Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nA second Arab diplomat told AFP on Wednesday that Jordanian officials were looking for 20 missing pilgrims, though 80 others who were initially reported missing were located in hospitals.\n\nAn Asian diplomat told AFP there were \"around 68 dead\" from India and that others were missing.\n\n\"Some (died) because of natural causes and we had many old-age pilgrims. And some are due to the weather conditions, that's what we assume,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year more than 200 pilgrims were reported dead, most of them from Indonesia.\n\n'No news'\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly official permits.\n\nThis has become easier since 2019 when Saudi Arabia introduced a general tourism visa, said Umer Karim, an expert on Saudi politics at the University of Birmingham.\n\n\"Before, the only people who could have done that were residents of the kingdom, and they know the situation,\" he said.\n\n\"For these tourist visa guys, it's like being on the migrant route without any idea of what to expect.\"\n\nOne of the Arab diplomats who spoke to AFP on Wednesday said many of the dead Egyptians were unregistered.\n\nEven pilgrims who have official permits can be vulnerable, including Houria Ahmad Abdallah Sharif, a 70-year-old Egyptian pilgrim who has been missing since Saturday.\n\nAfter praying on Mount Arafat, she told a friend she wanted to go to a public bathroom to clean her abaya, but she never came back.\n\n\"We've searched for her from door to door and we have not found her until now,\" said the friend, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"We know many who are still searching for their family members and relatives and they are not finding them, or if they are finding them they are finding them dead,\" the friend added.", "source": {"uri": "globalnation.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They were exhausted,\" one Arab diplomat told AFP on Thursday of Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the hajj's climax.\n\nThe diplomat said the main cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other issues.\n\nEgyptian officials were visiting hospitals to obtain information and help Egyptian pilgrims get medical care, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"However, there are large numbers of Egyptian citizens who are not registered in hajj databases, which requires double the effort and a longer time to search for missing persons and find their relatives,\" it said.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi has ordered that a \"crisis cell\" headed by the prime minister follow up on the deaths of the country's pilgrims.\n\nSisi stressed \"the need for immediate coordination with the Saudi authorities to facilitate receiving the bodies of the deceased and streamline the process,\" said a statement from his office.\n\nMore fatalities were also confirmed on Thursday by Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nOut of around 150,000 pilgrims, Pakistan has so far recorded 58 deaths, a diplomat told AFP.\n\n\"I think given the number of people, given the weather, this is just natural,\" the diplomat said.\n\nIndonesia, which had around 240,000 pilgrims, raised its death toll to 183, its religious affairs ministry said, compared with 313 deaths recorded last year.\n\nDeaths have also been confirmed by Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region. In many cases, authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nFriends and relatives have been searching for missing pilgrims, scouring hospitals and pleading online for news, fearing the worst.\n\nTwo diplomats told AFP Thursday that Saudi authorities had begun the burial process for dead pilgrims, cleaning the bodies and putting them in white burial cloth and taking them to be interred.\n\n\"The burial is done by the Saudi authorities. They have their own system so we just follow that,\" said one diplomat, who said his country was working to notify loved ones as best it could.\n\nThe other diplomat said that given the number of fatalities it would be impossible to notify many families ahead of time, especially in Egypt which accounts for so many of the dead.\n\nJordan's foreign ministry said on Thursday that Saudi authorities had granted 68 permits for Jordanian pilgrims to be buried in Mecca.\n\nSixteen Jordanians remain missing and 22 are in hospital, including seven who are in critical condition, the foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year various countries reported more than 300 deaths during the hajj, mostly Indonesians.\n\nThe timing of the hajj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.\n\nA 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for hajj pilgrims will exceed the \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, \"with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses\".\n\nHosting the hajj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's official title includes the words \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in Mecca and Medina.\n\nThe hajj has seen a number of disasters over the years, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the \"stoning the devil\" ritual killed up to 2,300 people.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

timing of the hajj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.\n\nA 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for hajj pilgrims will exceed the \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, \"with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses\".\n\nHosting the hajj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's official title includes the words \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in Mecca and Medina.\n\nThe hajj has been the scene of a number of stampedes and fires over the years, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the \"stoning the devil\" ritual in Mina, near Mecca, killed up to 2,300 people in the event's mostly deadly disaster.", "source": {"uri": "citizen.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The overall number of deaths was derived from the hospital morgue in the Al-Muaisem neighborhood of Mecca.\n\nThe ambassadors reported that at least 60 Jordanians also perished, surpassing the official count of 41 that Amman had earlier on Tuesday announced. An AFP count puts the number of deaths recorded by various countries up to 577 with the addition of these latest deaths.\n\nAccording to the diplomats, there were 550 people overall at the largest morgue in Mecca, located at Al-Muaisem. One of the five pillars of Islam is the hajj, which every Muslim who has the means to do so must perform at least once.\n\nA Saudi report released last month claimed that the trip is becoming more and more impacted by climate change, with temperatures in the pilgrimage area rising by 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) every ten years.\n\nThe Saudi National Meteorological Center reported that on Monday, temperatures in the Grand Mosque in Mecca reached 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit).\n\nHeat stress\n\nEgypt's foreign ministry had earlier on Tuesday said that Cairo was working with Saudi authorities to look for Egyptians who had vanished during the hajj.\n\nA statement from the ministry stated that \"a certain number of deaths\" had happened, although it did not say if Egyptians were among them. The Saudi authorities have stated that they are treating over 2,000 pilgrims who are experiencing heat exhaustion; however, they have not updated this number since Sunday and have not disclosed any information regarding fatalities.\n\nLast year, at least 240 pilgrims -- mostly from Indonesia -- were reported deceased by several nations. Reporters from AFP observed pilgrims in Mina, outside of Mecca, on Monday dousing themselves in water bottles while volunteers provided them with chilled beverages and chocolate ice cream that melted quickly to keep cool.\n\nPilgrims were instructed by Saudi officials to carry umbrellas, stay hydrated, and stay out of the sun during the hottest parts of the day. But spending hours outside during the day is a requirement of several hajj rites, including as the prayers on Mount Arafat that were performed on Saturday.\n\nSome pilgrims reported witnessing lifeless bodies at the side of the road and occasionally feeling overrun by medical services. Saudi authorities estimate that approximately 1.8 million pilgrims performed the hajj this year, with 1.6 million coming from outside the country.\n\nUnregistered Travellers\n\nTens of thousands of pilgrims seek to complete the hajj through unofficial means every year because they are unable to pay the very expensive processes required to obtain official hajj visas.\n\nDue to their inability to use the air-conditioned facilities that Saudi authorities have supplied along the hajj route, these unreported pilgrims are put in danger.\n\nA diplomat who talked with AFP on Tuesday claimed that a significant number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims had \"absolutely\" increased the number of Egyptian deaths.\n\nAn Egyptian official overseeing the nation's hajj mission claimed that \"irregular pilgrims caused great chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims' camps, causing the collapse of services.\"\n\n\"The pilgrims went without food, water, or air conditioning for a long time.\" \"The majority of people had no place\" to seek refuge, so many died from the heat.\n\nPrior to the hajj, hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims were removed from Mecca, according to Saudi officials earlier this month. Senegal, Indonesia, and Iran are among the other nations that have reported hajj-related fatalities this year.\n\nThe majority of nations have not disclosed the number of deaths linked to heat. According to the official Saudi Press Agency, Saudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel declared on Tuesday that health preparations for the hajj had \"been successfully carried out,\" averting significant illness outbreaks and other hazards to public health.\n\nHealth professionals \"provided virtual consultations to over 5,800 pilgrims, primarily for heat-related illnesses, enabling prompt intervention and mitigating the potential for a surge in cases,\" according to SPA.", "source": {"uri": "ptcnews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "PTC News"}, "authors": [],

They were exhausted,\" one Arab diplomat told AFP, referring to Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the hajj's climax.\n\nThe diplomat said the main cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other issues.\n\nBurials begin\n\nIn addition to Egypt, new fatalities were confirmed by Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nOut of around 150,000 pilgrims, Pakistan has so far recorded 58 deaths, a diplomat briefed on the tally told AFP.\n\n\"I think given the number of people, given the weather, this is just natural,\" the diplomat said.\n\nIndonesia, which had around 240,000 pilgrims, raised its death toll to 183, according to the ministry of religious affairs, compared with 313 deaths recorded last year.\n\nDeaths have also been confirmed by Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region. In many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nMeanwhile friends and family members have been searching for pilgrims who are still missing.\n\nThey scoured hospitals yesterday and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst during the scorching temperatures.\n\nTwo diplomats told AFP that Saudi authorities had begun the burial process for dead pilgrims, which involves cleaning up the bodies, putting them in white burial cloth and taking them to be interred in individual graves.\n\n\"The burial is done by the Saudi authorities. They have their own system so we just follow that,\" said one diplomat, who pointed out that his country was working to notify loved ones of the dead as best it could.\n\nThe other diplomat said that given the number of fatalities it would be impossible to notify many families ahead of time, especially in Egypt which accounts for so many of the dead.\n\n'Extreme danger'\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year various countries reported more than 300 deaths during the hajj, mostly Indonesians.\n\nThe timing of the hajj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.\n\nA 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for hajj pilgrims will exceed the \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, \"with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses\".\n\nHosting the hajj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's official title includes the words \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in Mecca and Medina.\n\nThe hajj has been the scene of several stampedes and fires over the years, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the \"stoning the devil\" ritual in Mina, near Mecca, killed up to 2,300 people in the event's mostly deadly disaster.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [],

In many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nMeanwhile, friends and family members have been searching for pilgrims who are still missing.\n\nOn Wednesday they scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst during the scorching temperatures.\n\nTwo diplomats told AFP on Thursday that Saudi authorities had begun the burial process for dead pilgrims, which involves cleaning up the bodies, putting them in white burial cloth and taking them to be interred in individual graves.\n\n\"The burial is done by the Saudi authorities. They have their own system so we just follow that,\" said one diplomat, who pointed out that his country was working to notify loved ones of the dead as best it could.\n\nThe other diplomat said that given the number of fatalities it would be impossible to notify many families ahead of time, especially in Egypt which accounts for so many of the dead.\n\nExtreme danger\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year various countries reported more than 300 deaths during the hajj, mostly Indonesians.\n\nThe timing of the hajj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.\n\nA 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for hajj pilgrims will exceed the \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, \"with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses\".\n\nHosting the hajj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's official title includes the words \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in Mecca and Medina.\n\nThe hajj has been the scene of a number of stampedes and fires over the years, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the \"stoning the devil\" ritual in Mina, near Mecca, killed up to 2,300 people in the event's mostly deadly disaster.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily

Hajj, Mostly Egyptians", "body": "Diplomats claimed on Tuesday that at least 550 pilgrims perished during the hajj, highlighting the arduous nature of the trip, which took place in hot conditions this year.\n\nAccording to the two Arab diplomats coordinating their countries' responses, at least 323 Egyptians perished, the most of them from heat-related ailments.\n\n\"All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat\" except for one who got fatal injuries during a brief crowd crush, one of the diplomats said, adding that the entire figure came from the hospital morgue in Mecca's Al-Muaisem neighborhood.\n\nAt least 60 Jordanians perished, according to the diplomats, up from Amman's official figure of 41 earlier on Tuesday.\n\nThe fresh deaths raise the total reported by numerous countries to 577, according to an AFP calculation.\n\nAccording to diplomats, the number at Al-Muaisem morgue, one of Mecca's largest, was 550.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Egypt's foreign ministry said it was working with Saudi officials to locate Egyptians who had gone missing during the hajj.\n\nWhile the ministry stated that \"a certain number of deaths\" had occurred, it did not indicate if Egyptians were among them.\n\nSaudi authorities have reported treating more than 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress, but have not updated the tally since Sunday and have not released any information on fatalities.\n\nLast year, numerous countries reported the deaths of at least 240 pilgrims, the majority of whom were Indonesians.\n\nSun exposure\n\nThe hajj is one of Islam's five pillars, and all Muslims who have the means must perform it at least once.\n\nClimate change is progressively affecting the pilgrimage, according to a Saudi research published last month, which found that temperatures in the area where rites are done were rising by 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade.\n\nOn Monday, temperatures in Mecca's Grand Mosque reached 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit), according to the Saudi national meteorology centre.\n\nOn Monday, AFP journalists in Mina, outside Mecca, watched pilgrims pouring bottles of water over their heads while volunteers handed out cold drinks and fast-melting chocolate ice cream to keep them cool.\n\nSaudi officials had recommended pilgrims to bring umbrellas, drink plenty of water, and avoid the sun during the warmest hours of the day.\n\nHowever, several hajj rites, like Saturday's prayers on Mount Arafat, require spending hours outside during the day.\n\nSome pilgrims reported witnessing unmoving bodies by the wayside and ambulance personnel that appeared overburdened at times.\n\nAccording to Saudi authorities, over 1.8 million pilgrims performed the hajj this year, with 1.6 million coming from outside Saudi Arabia.\n\nUnregistered pilgrims\n\nEvery year, tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to undertake the hajj without obtaining official hajj visas in order to save money, which is a riskier endeavor because these off-the-books pilgrims cannot access air-conditioned facilities supplied by Saudi authorities along the hajj route.\n\nOne of the ambassadors who spoke with AFP on Tuesday stated that the Egyptian death toll was \"absolutely\" inflated by a huge number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims.\n\nEarlier this month, Saudi officials announced that they had evacuated hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca ahead of the hajj.\n\nOther countries reporting deaths during the hajj this year include Indonesia, Iran, and Senegal.\n\nThe majority of countries have not mentioned how many deaths were caused by high temperatures.\n\nHosting the hajj provides prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's title includes \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\" at Mecca and Medina.\n\nSaudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel stated on Tuesday that health measures for the hajj were \"successfully carried out,\" preventing major illness outbreaks and other public health hazards, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.\n\nA virtual medical center \"provided virtual consultations to over 5,800 pilgrims, primarily for heat-related illnesses, enabling prompt intervention and mitigating the potential for a surge in cases,\" claimed the SPA.", "source": {"uri": "howafrica.com", "dataType":

They were exhausted,\" one Arab diplomat told AFP on Thursday, referring to Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the hajj's climax.\n\nThe diplomat said the main cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other issues.\n\nEgyptian officials were visiting hospitals to obtain data on Egyptian pilgrims and help those still alive to get medical care, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"However, there are large numbers of Egyptian citizens who are not registered in hajj databases, which requires double the effort and a longer time to search for missing persons and find their relatives,\" the ministry said.\n\nIn addition to Egypt, new fatalities were confirmed on Thursday by Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nOut of around 150,000 pilgrims, Pakistan has so far recorded 58 deaths, a diplomat briefed on the tally told AFP.\n\n\"I think given the number of people, given the weather, this is just natural,\" the diplomat said.\n\nIndonesia, which had around 240,000 pilgrims, raised its death toll to 183, according to the ministry of religious affairs, compared with 313 deaths recorded last year.\n\nDeaths have also been confirmed by Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region. In many cases, authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nMeanwhile, friends and family members have been searching for pilgrims who are still missing.\n\nOn Wednesday they scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst during the scorching temperatures.\n\nTwo diplomats told AFP on Thursday that Saudi authorities had begun the burial process for dead pilgrims, which involves cleaning up the bodies, putting them in white burial cloth and taking them to be interred in individual graves.\n\n\"The burial is done by the Saudi authorities. They have their own system so we just follow that,\" said one diplomat, who pointed out that his country was working to notify loved ones of the dead as best it could.\n\nThe other diplomat said that given the number of fatalities it would be impossible to notify many families ahead of time, especially in Egypt which accounts for so many of the dead.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year various countries reported more than 300 deaths during the hajj, mostly Indonesians.\n\nThe timing of the hajj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.\n\nA 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for hajj pilgrims will exceed the \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, \"with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses\".\n\nHosting the hajj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's official title includes the words \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in Mecca and Medina.\n\nThe hajj has been the scene of a number of stampedes and fires over the years, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the \"stoning the devil\" ritual in Mina, near Mecca, killed up to 2,300 people in the event's mostly deadly disaster.", "source": {"uri": "terradaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Terra Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

In many cases, authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nFriends and relatives have been searching for missing pilgrims, scouring hospitals and pleading online for news, fearing the worst.\n\nTwo diplomats told AFP Thursday that Saudi authorities had begun the burial process for dead pilgrims, cleaning the bodies and putting them in white burial cloth and taking them to be interred.\n\n\"The burial is done by the Saudi authorities. They have their own system so we just follow that,\" said one diplomat, who said his country was working to notify loved ones as best it could.\n\nThe other diplomat said that given the number of

Indonesians.\n\nThe timing of the hajj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.\n\nA 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for hajj pilgrims will exceed the \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, \"with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses\".\n\nHosting the hajj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's official title includes the words \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in Mecca and Medina.\n\nThe hajj has seen a number of disasters over the years, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the \"stoning the devil\" ritual

They were exhausted,\" one Arab diplomat told AFP on Thursday, referring to Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the hajj's climax.\n\nThe diplomat said the main cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other issues.\n\nIn addition to Egypt, new fatalities were confirmed on Thursday by Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nOut of around 150,000 pilgrims, Pakistan has so far recorded 58 deaths, a diplomat briefed on the tally told AFP.\n\n\"I think given the number of people, given the weather, this is just natural,\" the diplomat said.\n\nIndonesia, which had around 240,000 pilgrims, raised its death toll to 183, according to the ministry of religious affairs, compared with 313 deaths recorded last year.\n\nDeaths have also been confirmed by Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region. In many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nMeanwhile friends and family members have been searching for pilgrims who are still missing.\n\nOn Wednesday they scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst during the scorching temperatures.\n\nTwo diplomats told AFP on Thursday that Saudi authorities had begun the burial process for dead pilgrims, which involves cleaning up the bodies, putting them in white burial cloth and taking them to be interred in individual graves.\n\n\"The burial is done by the Saudi authorities. They have their own system so we just follow that,\" said one diplomat, who pointed out that his country was working to notify loved ones of the dead as best it could.\n\nThe other diplomat said that given the number of fatalities it would be impossible to notify many families ahead of time, especially in Egypt which accounts for so many of the dead.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year various countries reported more than 300 deaths during the hajj, mostly Indonesians.\n\nThe timing of the hajj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.\n\nA 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for hajj pilgrims will exceed the \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, \"with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses\".\n\nHosting the hajj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's official title includes the words \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in Mecca and Medina.\n\nThe hajj has been the scene of a number of stampedes and fires over the years, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the \"stoning the devil\" ritual in Mina, near Mecca, killed up to 2,300 people in the event's mostly deadly disaster.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [],

channels as they cannot afford the often costly official permits.This has become easier since 2019 when Saudi Arabia introduced a general tourism visa, said Umer Karim, an expert on Saudi politics at the University of Birmingham.\"Before, the only people who could have done that were residents of the kingdom, and they know the situation,\" he&nbsp;said.\"For these tourist visa guys, it's like

They were exhausted,\" one Arab diplomat told AFP on Thursday, referring to Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the hajj's climax.\n\nThe diplomat said the main cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other issues.\n\nOut of around 150,000 pilgrims, Pakistan has so far recorded 58 deaths, a diplomat briefed on the tally told AFP.\n\n\"I think given the number of people, given the weather, this is just natural,\" the diplomat said.\n\nIndonesia, which had around 240,000 pilgrims, raised its death toll to 183, according to the ministry of religious affairs, compared with 313 deaths recorded last year.\n\nDeaths have also been confirmed by Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region. In many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nMeanwhile friends and family members have been searching for pilgrims who are still missing.\n\nOn Wednesday they scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst during the scorching temperatures.\n\nTwo diplomats told AFP on Thursday that Saudi authorities had begun the burial process for dead pilgrims, which involves cleaning up the bodies, putting them in white burial cloth and taking them to be interred in individual graves.\n\n\"The burial is done by the Saudi authorities. They have their own system so we just follow that,\" said one diplomat, who pointed out that his country was working to notify loved ones of the dead as best it could.\n\nThe other diplomat said that given the number of fatalities it would be impossible to notify many families ahead of time, especially in Egypt which accounts for so many of the dead.\n\nLast year various countries reported more than 300 deaths during the hajj, mostly Indonesians.\n\nThe timing of the hajj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.\n\nA 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for hajj pilgrims will exceed the \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, \"with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses\".\n\nHosting the hajj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's official title includes the words \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in Mecca and Medina.\n\nThe hajj has been the scene of a number of stampedes and fires over the years, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the \"stoning the devil\" ritual in Mina, near Mecca, killed up to 2,300 people in the event's mostly deadly disaster.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news",

They were exhausted,\" one Arab diplomat told AFP on Thursday of Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the hajj's climax.\n\nThe diplomat said the main cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other issues.\n\nEgyptian officials were visiting hospitals to obtain information and help Egyptian pilgrims get medical care, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"However, there are large numbers of Egyptian citizens who are not registered in hajj databases, which requires double the effort and a longer time to search for missing persons and find their relatives,\" it said.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi has ordered that a \"crisis cell\" headed by the prime minister follow up on the deaths of the country's pilgrims.\n\nSisi stressed \"the need for immediate coordination with the Saudi authorities to facilitate receiving the bodies of the deceased and streamline the process,\" said a statement from his office.\n\n- Burials begin -\n\nMore fatalities were also confirmed on Thursday by Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nMore from this section Thailand: Nation To Become First To Legalize Same-Sex Marriage In Southeast Asia 2 Sounds of the past | \u0110\u1ed9c \u0111\u00e1o \u0111\u00e0n \u0111\u00e1 Kh\u00e1nh S\u01a1n German rappers spark buzz with rhubarb-bar blabber\n\nOut of around 150,000 pilgrims, Pakistan has so far recorded 58 deaths, a diplomat told AFP.\n\n\"I think given the number of people, given the weather, this is just natural,\" the diplomat said.\n\nIndonesia, which had around 240,000 pilgrims, raised its death toll to 183, its religious affairs ministry said, compared with 313 deaths recorded last year.\n\nDeaths have also been confirmed by Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region. In many cases, authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nFriends and relatives have been searching for missing pilgrims, scouring hospitals and pleading online for news, fearing the worst.\n\nTwo diplomats told AFP Thursday that Saudi authorities had begun the burial process for dead pilgrims, cleaning the bodies and putting them in white burial cloth and taking them to be interred.\n\n\"The burial is done by the Saudi authorities. They have their own system so we just follow that,\" said one diplomat, who said his country was working to notify loved ones as best it could.\n\nThe other diplomat said that given the number of fatalities it would be impossible to notify many families ahead of time, especially in Egypt which accounts for so many of the dead.\n\n- 'Extreme danger' -\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year various countries reported more than 300 deaths during the hajj, mostly Indonesians.\n\nThe timing of the hajj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.\n\nA 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for hajj pilgrims will exceed the \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, \"with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses\".\n\nHosting the hajj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's official title includes the words \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in Mecca and Medina.\n\nThe hajj has seen a number of disasters over the years, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the \"stoning the devil\" ritual killed up to 2,300 people.\n\nbur/srm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@reformer.com", "name": "Agence

An Arab diplomat told AFP that deaths among Egyptians alone had jumped to \"at least 600\", from more than 300 a day earlier, mostly from the unforgiving heat.\n\nThat figure brought the total reported dead so far to 922, according to an AFP tally of figures released by various countries. The diplomat later added that Egyptian officials in Saudi Arabia had received \"1,400 reports of missing pilgrims\", including the 600 dead. Mabrouka bint Salem Shushana of Tunisia, in her early 70s, has been missing since the climax of the pilgrimage on Saturday at Mount Arafat, her husband Mohammed told AFP on Wednesday.\n\nBecause she was unregistered and did not have an official hajj permit, she was unable to access air-conditioned facilities that allow pilgrims to cool down, he said. \"She's an old lady. She was tired. She was feeling so hot, and she had no place to sleep,\" he said.\n\n\"I looked for her in all the hospitals. Until now I don't have a clue.\" Facebook and other social media networks have been flooded with pictures of the missing and requests for information. Those searching for news include family and friends of Ghada Mahmoud Ahmed Dawood, an Egyptian pilgrim unaccounted for since Saturday.\n\n\"I received a call from her daughter in Egypt begging me to put any post on Facebook that can help track her or find her,\" said one family friend based in Saudi Arabia, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to anger Saudi authorities. \"The good news is that until now we did not find her on the list of the dead people, which gives us hope she is still alive.\"\n\n- Searing heat - The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once. Its timing is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, shifting forward each year in the Gregorian calendar. For the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer. According to a Saudi study published last month, temperatures in the area are rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nIn addition to Egypt, fatalities have also been confirmed by Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nA second Arab diplomat told AFP on Wednesday that Jordanian officials were looking for 20 missing pilgrims, though 80 others who were initially reported missing were located in hospitals. An Asian diplomat told AFP there were \"around 68 dead\" from India and that others were missing. \"Some (died) because of natural causes and we had many old-age pilgrims. And some are due to the weather conditions, that's what we assume,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone. Last year more than 200 pilgrims were reported dead, most of them from Indonesia. - 'No news' - Each year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly official permits. This has become easier since 2019 when Saudi Arabia introduced a general tourism visa, said Umer Karim, an expert on Saudi politics at the University of Birmingham. \"Before, the only people who could have done that were residents of the kingdom, and they know the situation,\" he said.\n\n\"For these tourist visa guys, it's like being on the migrant route without any idea of what to expect.\" One of the Arab diplomats who spoke to AFP on Wednesday said many of the dead Egyptians were unregistered. Even pilgrims who have official permits can be vulnerable, including Houria Ahmad Abdallah Sharif, a 70-year-old Egyptian pilgrim who has been missing since Saturday.\n\nAfter praying on Mount Arafat, she told a friend she wanted to go to a public bathroom to clean her abaya, but she never came back. \"We've searched for her from door to door and we have not found her until now,\" said the friend, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"We know many who are still searching for their family members and relatives and they are not finding them, or if they are finding them they are finding them dead,\" the friend added.", "source": {"uri": "omanobserver.om", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oman Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@omanobserver.om", "name": "Agence

About 1.8 million people attended the pilgrimage.\n\nMabrouka bint Salem Shushana of Tunisia, in her early 70s, has been missing since the climax of the pilgrimage on Saturday at Mount Arafat, her husband Mohammed told AFP on Wednesday.\n\nBecause she was unregistered and did not have an official hajj permit, she was unable to access air-conditioned facilities that allow pilgrims to cool off after hours of outdoor prayers, Mohammed said.\n\n\"She's an old lady. She was tired. She was feeling so hot, and she had no place to sleep,\" he said. \"I looked for her in all the hospitals. Until now I don't have a clue.\"\n\nHe is far from the only one desperate for information.\n\nFacebook and other social media networks have been flooded with pictures of the missing and requests for information.\n\nThe searchers include family and friends of Ghada Mahmoud Ahmed Dawood, an Egyptian pilgrim unaccounted for since Saturday.\n\n\"I received a call from her daughter in Egypt begging me to put any post on Facebook that can help track her or find her,\" said one family friend based in Saudi Arabia, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to anger Saudi authorities.\n\n\"The good news is that until now we did not find her on the list of the dead people, which gives us hope she is still alive.\"\n\n- Searing heat -\n\nThe hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once.\n\nIts timing is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, shifting forward each year in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nFor the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer.\n\nAccording to a Saudi study published last month, temperatures in the area are rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nThe figure of 550 dead provided by diplomats on Tuesday came from the hospital morgue in Mecca's Al-Muaisem neighbourhood, one of the biggest in the city.\n\nIt includes 323 Egyptians and 60 Jordanians, said the Arab diplomats who briefed AFP on the figures, one of whom noted that nearly all the Egyptians died \"because of heat\".\n\nFatalities have also been confirmed by Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nOn Wednesday an Asian diplomat told AFP there were \"around 68 dead\" from India and that others were missing.\n\n\"Some (died) because of natural causes and we had many old-age pilgrims. And some are due to the weather conditions, that's what we assume,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year more than 200 pilgrims were reported dead, most of them from Indonesia.\n\n- 'No news' -\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly official permits.\n\nThis has become easier since 2019 when Saudi Arabia introduced a general tourism visa, said Umer Karim, an expert on Saudi politics at the University of Birmingham.\n\n\"Before, the only people who could have done that were residents of the kingdom, and they know the situation,\" he said.\n\n\"For these tourist visa guys, it's like being on the migrant route without any idea of what to expect.\"\n\nEven pilgrims who have official permits can be vulnerable, including Houria Ahmad Abdallah Sharif, a 70-year-old Egyptian pilgrim who has been missing since Saturday.\n\nAfter praying on Mount Arafat, she told a friend she wanted to go a public bathroom to clean her abaya, but she never came back.\n\n\"We've searched for her from door to door and we have not found her until now,\" said the friend, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"We know many who are still searching for their family members and relatives and they are not finding them, or if they are finding them they are finding them dead,\" the friend added.", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news",

They were exhausted,\" one Arab diplomat told AFP today, referring to Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the hajj's climax.\n\nThe diplomat said the main cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other issues.\n\nBurials begin\n\nIn addition to Egypt, new fatalities were confirmed on Thursday by Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nOut of around 150,000 pilgrims, Pakistan has so far recorded 58 deaths, a diplomat briefed on the tally told AFP.\n\n\"I think given the number of people, given the weather, this is just natural,\" the diplomat said.\n\nIndonesia, which had around 240,000 pilgrims, raised its death toll to 183, according to the ministry of religious affairs, compared with 313 deaths recorded last year.\n\nDeaths have also been confirmed by Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region. In many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nMeanwhile friends and family members have been searching for pilgrims who are still missing.\n\nOn Wednesday they scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst during the scorching temperatures.\n\nTwo diplomats told AFP on Thursday that Saudi authorities had begun the burial process for dead pilgrims, which involves cleaning up the bodies, putting them in white burial cloth and taking them to be interred in individual graves.\n\n\"The burial is done by the Saudi authorities. They have their own system so we just follow that,\" said one diplomat, who pointed out that his country was working to notify loved ones of the dead as best it could.\n\nThe other diplomat said that given the number of fatalities it would be impossible to notify many families ahead of time, especially in Egypt which accounts for so many of the dead.\n\n'Extreme danger'\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year various countries reported more than 300 deaths during the haj, mostly Indonesians.\n\nThe timing of the hajj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.\n\nA 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for hajj pilgrims will exceed the \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, \"with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses\".\n\nHosting the hajj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's official title includes the words \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in Mecca and Medina.\n\nThe hajj has been the scene of a number of stampedes and fires over the years, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the \"stoning the devil\" ritual in Mina, near Mecca, killed up to 2,300 people in the event's mostly deadly disaster. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"},

"VISA ISSUES: A diplomat said the death toll among Egyptians was boosted by the number of people who traveled to Saudi Arabia without properly registering\n\nDiplomats on Tuesday said that at least 550 pilgrims died during the hajj, underscoring the gruelling nature of the pilgrimage which again unfolded in scorching temperatures this year.\n\nAt least 323 of those who died were Egyptians, most of them succumbing to heat-related illnesses, two Arab diplomats coordinating their countries' responses said.\n\n\"All of them [the Egyptians] died because of heat\" except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, one of the diplomats said, adding that the total figure came from the hospital morgue in the al-Muaisem neighborhood of Mecca.\n\nAt least 60 Jordanians also died, the diplomats said, up from an official tally of 41 given earlier on Tuesday by Amman.\n\nThe new deaths bring the total reported so far by multiple countries to 577, an Agence France-Presse tally showed.\n\nThe diplomats said that the total at the morgue in al-Muaisem, one of the biggest in Mecca, was 550.\n\nThe hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once.\n\nTemperatures hit 51.8\u00b0C at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday, the Saudi Arabian National Meteorology Center said.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Cairo was collaborating with Saudi Arabian authorities on search operations for Egyptians who had gone missing during the hajj.\n\nWhile a ministry statement said that \"a certain number of deaths\" had occurred, it did not specify whether Egyptians were among them.\n\nSaudi Arabian authorities have reported treating more than 2,000 pilgrims for heat stress, but had not updated that figure since Sunday and had not provided information on fatalities.\n\nJournalists in Mina, outside Mecca, on Monday saw pilgrims pouring bottles of water over their heads as volunteers handed out cold drinks and ice cream to help them keep cool.\n\nSaudi Arabian officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nHowever, many of the hajj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat that took place on Saturday last week, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime.\n\nSome pilgrims described seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and ambulance services that appeared overwhelmed at times.\n\nAbout 1.8 million people took part in the hajj this year, 1.6 million of them from abroad, Saudi Arabian authorities said.\n\nEach year tens of thousands of people attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels, as they cannot afford the often costly procedures for official hajj visas.\n\nThis places these off-the-books pilgrims at risk, as they cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by authorities along the hajj route.\n\nOne of the diplomats who spoke to reporters on Tuesday said that the Egyptian death toll was \"absolutely\" boosted by a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims.\n\n\"Irregular pilgrims caused great chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims' camps, causing the collapse of services,\" said an Egyptian official supervising the country's hajj mission. \"The pilgrims went without food, water, or air-conditioning for a long time.\"\n\nThey died \"from the heat because most people had no place\" to take shelter, the official said.\n\nEarlier this month, Saudi Arabian officials said that they had cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca ahead of the hajj.\n\nOther countries to report deaths during the hajj this year include Indonesia, Iran and Senegal.\n\nMost countries have not specified how many deaths were heat-related.\n\nSaudi Arabian Minister of Health Fahd bin Abdul Rahman al-Jalajel on Tuesday said that health plans for the hajj had \"been successfully carried out,\" preventing major outbreaks of disease and other public health threats, the Saudi Press Agency reported.\n\nHealth officials \"provided virtual consultations to over 5,800 pilgrims, primarily for heat-related illnesses, enabling prompt intervention and mitigating the potential for a surge in cases,\" it said.", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors":

frequency and intensity as the century progresses\".\n\nHosting the hajj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's official title includes the words \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in Mecca and Medina.\n\nThe hajj has been the scene of a number of stampedes and fires over the years, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the \"stoning the devil\" ritual in

The new deaths reported Thursday included 58 from Egypt, according to an Arab diplomat who provided a breakdown showing that of 658 total dead from that country, 630 were unregistered.\n\nAll told around 10 countries have reported 1,081 deaths during the annual pilgrimage, one of the five pillars of Islam which all Muslims with the means must complete at least once. The figures have come via official statements or from diplomats working on their countries' responses.\n\nThe hajj, whose timing is determined by the lunar Islamic calendar, fell again this year during the oven-like Saudi summer.\n\nThe national meteorological center reported a high of 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit) earlier this week at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Egyptian officials reached by CBS News would not confirm the figures stated by the AFP, but dozens of videos posted on social media in recent days showed bodies laying on the streets around the Grand Mosque.\n\nAccording to a Saudi study published last month, temperatures in the area are rising 0.4 degrees Celsius, or just less than one degree Fahrenheit, each decade.\n\nEvery year, tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly official permits. Saudi authorities reported clearing hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca earlier this month, but it appears many still participated in the main rites which began last Friday.\n\nThis group was more vulnerable to the heat because, without official permits, they could not access air-conditioned spaces provided by Saudi authorities for the 1.8 million authorized pilgrims to cool down after hours of walking and praying outside.\n\n\"People were tired after being chased by security forces before Arafat day. They were exhausted,\" one Arab diplomat told AFP on Thursday, referring to Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the hajj's climax.\n\nThe diplomat said the principal cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other issues.\n\nIn addition to Egypt, fatalities have also been confirmed to AFP by Malaysia, Pakistan, India, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nFriends and family members have been searching for pilgrims who are still missing.\n\nOn Wednesday they scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst during the scorching temperatures.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nMelinda French Gates reflects on personal growth, commitment to advocacy",

About 1.8 million people attended the pilgrimage.\n\nMabrouka bint Salem Shushana, of Tunisia, in her early 70s, has been missing since the climax of the pilgrimage on Saturday at Mount Arafat, her husband, Mohammed, told AFP on Wednesday.\n\nBecause she was unregistered and did not have an official hajj permit, she was unable to access air-conditioned facilities that allow pilgrims to cool off after hours of outdoor prayers, Mohammed said.\n\n\"She's an old lady. She was tired. She was feeling so hot, and she had no place to sleep,\" he said. \"I looked for her in all the hospitals. Until now I don't have a clue.\"\n\nHe is not the only one desperate for information. Facebook and other social media networks have been flooded with pictures of the missing and requests for information.\n\nThe searchers include family and friends of Ghada Mahmoud Ahmed Dawood, an Egyptian pilgrim unaccounted for since Saturday.\n\n\"I received a call from her daughter in Egypt begging me to put any post on Facebook that can help track her or find her,\" said one family friend based in Saudi Arabia, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to anger Saudi authorities.\n\n\"The good news is that until now we did not find her on the list of the dead people, which gives us hope she is still alive.\"\n\nThe hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once. Its timing is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, shifting forward each year in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nFor the past few years, the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer. According to a Saudi study published last month, temperatures in the area are rising 0.4 degrees celsius (0.72 degrees fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nThe figure of 550 dead provided by diplomats on Tuesday came from the hospital morgue in Mecca's Al-Muaisem neighbourhood, one of the biggest in the city. It includes 323 Egyptians and 60 Jordanians, said the Arab diplomats who briefed AFP on the figures, one of whom noted that nearly all the Egyptians died \"because of heat\".\n\nFatalities have also been confirmed by Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nOn Wednesday, an Asian diplomat told AFP there were \"around 68 dead\" from India and that others were missing. \"Some (died) because of natural causes and we had many old-age pilgrims. And some are due to the weather conditions, that's what we assume,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone. Last year, more than 200 pilgrims were reported dead, most of them from Indonesia.\n\nEach year, tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly official permits. This has become easier since 2019 when Saudi Arabia introduced a general tourism visa, said Umer Karim, an expert on Saudi politics at the University of Birmingham.\n\n\"Before, the only people who could have done that were residents of the kingdom, and they know the situation,\" he said. \"For these tourist visa guys, it's like being on the migrant route without any idea of what to expect.\"\n\nEven pilgrims who have official permits can be vulnerable. Houria Ahmad Abdallah Sharif, a 70-year-old Egyptian pilgrim, has been missing since Saturday. After praying on Mount Arafat, she told a friend she wanted to go a public bathroom to clean her abaya, but she never came back.\n\n\"We've searched for her from door to door and we have not found her until now,\" said the friend, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. \"We know many who are still searching for their family members and relatives and they are not finding them, or if they are finding them they are finding them dead,\" they added.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

them succumbing to heat-related illnesses, two Arab diplomats coordinating their countries' responses told AFP.\n\n\"All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat\" except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, one of the diplomats said, adding the total figure came from the hospital morgue in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood of Mecca.\n\nAt least 60 Jordanians also died, the diplomats said, up from an official tally of 41 given earlier on Tuesday by Amman.\n\nThe new deaths bring the total reported so far by multiple countries to 577, according to an AFP tally.\n\nThe diplomats said the total at the morgue in Al-Muaisem, one of the biggest in Mecca, was 550.\n\nThe Haj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once.\n\nThe pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month that said temperatures in the area where rituals are performed were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nTemperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday, the Saudi national meteorology center said.\n\nHEAT STRESS\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Egypt's foreign ministry said Cairo was collaborating with Saudi authorities on search operations for Egyptians who had gone missing during the Haj.\n\nWhile a ministry statement said \"a certain number of deaths\" had occurred, it did not specify whether Egyptians were among them.\n\nSaudi authorities have reported treating more than 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress but have not updated that figure since Sunday and have not provided information on fatalities.\n\nAt least 240 pilgrims were reported dead by various countries last year, most of them Indonesians.\n\nAFP journalists in Mina, outside Mecca, on Monday saw pilgrims pouring bottles of water over their heads as volunteers handed out cold drinks and fast-melting chocolate ice cream to help them keep cool.\n\nSaudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nBut many of the Haj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime.\n\nSome pilgrims described seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and ambulance services that appeared overwhelmed at times.\n\nAround 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the Haj this year, 1.6 million of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities.\n\nUNREGISTERED PILGRIMS\n\nEach year, tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the Haj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly procedures for official hajj visas.\n\nThis places these off-the-books pilgrims at risk as they cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the Haj route.\n\nOne of the diplomats who spoke to AFP on Tuesday said that the Egyptian death toll was \"absolutely\" boosted by a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims.\n\n\"Irregular pilgrims caused great chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims' camps, causing the collapse of services,\" said an Egyptian official supervising the country's hajj mission.\n\n\"The pilgrims went without food, water, or air conditioning for a long time.\"\n\nThey died \"from the heat because most people had no place\" to take shelter.\n\nEarlier this month, Saudi officials said they had cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca ahead of the Haj.\n\nOther countries to report deaths during the Haj this year include Indonesia, Iran and Senegal.\n\nMost countries have not specified how many deaths were heat-related.\n\nSaudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel said on Tuesday that health plans for the Haj had \"been successfully carried out,\" preventing major outbreaks of disease and other public health threats, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.\n\nHealth officials \"provided virtual consultations to over 5,800 pilgrims, primarily for heat-related illnesses, enabling prompt intervention and mitigating the potential for a surge in cases,\" SPA said.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This figure brings the total reported deaths to 922, according to an AFP tally based on figures released by various countries.\n\nThe diplomat added that Egyptian officials in Saudi Arabia had received \"1,400 reports of missing pilgrims,\" including the 600 deceased.\n\nOne of the missing pilgrims is Mabrouka bint Salem Shushana from Tunisia, in her early 70s. She has been missing since Saturday's climax of the pilgrimage at Mount Arafat, her husband Mohammed told AFP on Wednesday. Due to her unregistered status and lack of an official hajj permit, she was unable to access air-conditioned facilities. \"She's an old lady. She was tired. She was feeling so hot, and she had no place to sleep,\" he said. \"I looked for her in all the hospitals. Until now I don't have a clue.\"\n\nSocial media networks like Facebook have been inundated with pictures of the missing pilgrims and requests for information about them. Family and friends of Ghada Mahmoud Ahmed Dawood, an Egyptian pilgrim unaccounted for since Saturday, are among those seeking news. \"I received a call from her daughter in Egypt begging me to put any post on Facebook that can help track her or find her,\" said a family friend based in Saudi Arabia, who requested anonymity to avoid angering Saudi authorities. \"The good news is that until now we did not find her on the list of the dead people, which gives us hope she is still alive.\"\n\nHajj, one of the five pillars of Islam, is mandatory for all Muslims with the means to complete it at least once in their lifetime. Its timing is based on the Islamic lunar calendar, causing it to shift forward each year in the Gregorian calendar. Recently, the mainly outdoor rituals have coincided with the sweltering Saudi summer.\n\nA recent Saudi study indicated that temperatures in the region are rising by 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade. Fatalities have been reported in Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though many authorities have not specified the causes.\n\nA second Arab diplomat informed AFP that Jordanian officials were searching for 20 missing pilgrims, though 80 others initially reported missing were located in hospitals. An Asian diplomat reported \"around 68 dead\" from India, with others missing. \"Some (died) because of natural causes and we had many old-age pilgrims. And some are due to the weather conditions, that's what we assume,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided official information on fatalities, although it reported over 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone. Last year, more than 200 pilgrims, mostly from Indonesia, were reported dead.\n\nThe cost of official permits forces tens of thousands of pilgrims to perform the hajj through irregular channels each year. This has become easier since 2019, with Saudi Arabia's introduction of a general tourism visa, according to Umer Karim, an expert on Saudi politics at the University of Birmingham. \"For these tourist visa guys, it's like being on the migrant route without any idea of what to expect,\" he said.\n\nMany of the deceased Egyptians were unregistered, according to an Arab diplomat. Even pilgrims with official permits can be at risk, such as Houria Ahmad Abdallah Sharif, a 70-year-old Egyptian pilgrim who has been missing since Saturday. After praying on Mount Arafat, she went to a public bathroom to clean her abaya and never returned. \"We've searched for her from door to door and we have not found her until now,\" said a friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"We know many who are still searching for their family members and relatives and they are not finding them, or if they are finding them they are finding them dead,\" the friend added.", "source": {"uri": "leadership.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Leadership"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nafisat_abdulrahman@leadership.ng", "name": "Nafisat Abdulrahman", "type":

The deceased include 323 Egyptians who primarily succumbed to heat-related illnesses, according to two Arab diplomats coordinating their countries' responses.\n\n\"All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat\" except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, AFP reported, noting that the total figure was confirmed by the hospital morgue in the Al-Muaisem neighborhood of Mecca.\n\nThe death toll for Jordanians rose to at least 60, up from an earlier official tally of 41 reported by Amman on Tuesday.\n\nThese new fatalities bring the overall reported death toll to 577, according to an AFP tally. The morgue in Al-Muaisem, one of the largest in Mecca, recorded 550 bodies, the diplomats said.\n\nScorching Heat and Health Strain\n\nThe Hajj, one of Islam's five pillars, must be undertaken by all Muslims at least once in their lifetime. However, the demand for the pilgrimage is increasingly exacerbated by climate change, as noted in a recent Saudi study revealing a 0.4 degrees Celsius rise per decade in the area where Hajj rituals are performed.\n\nOn Monday, temperatures soared to 51.8 degrees Celsius at Mecca's Grand Mosque, AFP reported, citing the Saudi Met Office.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Egypt's foreign ministry announced collaboration with the Saudi authorities to search for missing Egyptian pilgrims. Although a ministry statement acknowledged \"a certain number of deaths\", it did not specify if Egyptians were among them.\n\nWhile the Saudi authorities reported treating over 2,000 pilgrims for heat stress, they have not updated this figure since Sunday, nor have they provided specific information on fatalities.\n\nA Harrowing Experience\n\nLast year, at least 240 pilgrims, mostly Indonesians, were reported dead. This year, AFP journalists in Mina observed pilgrims drenching themselves with water and volunteers distributing cold drinks and ice cream to help them cope with the heat.\n\nSaudi officials advised the pilgrims to use umbrellas, stay hydrated, and avoid the sun during peak hours. Despite these measures, many Hajj rituals, including prayers on Mount Arafat, require prolonged outdoor exposure during the day.\n\nSome pilgrims reported seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and overburdened ambulance services. This year, around 1.8 million pilgrims participated in the Hajj, with 1.6 million coming from abroad, according to the Saudi authorities.\n\nPerils of Unregistered Pilgrims\n\nEach year, tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt the Hajj through irregular channels, unable to afford official visa procedures. These off-the-books pilgrims lack access to air-conditioned facilities provided by the Saudi authorities, increasing their vulnerability.\n\nOne diplomat indicated that the high number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims significantly contributed to the death toll. An Egyptian official overseeing the country's Hajj mission noted that irregular pilgrims caused chaos, leading to service collapses and prolonged deprivation of food, water, and air-conditioning.\n\nEarlier this month, Saudi officials reported clearing hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca ahead of the Hajj.\n\nGlobal Impact\n\nOther countries, including Indonesia, Iran, and Senegal, have also reported deaths during this year's Hajj. However, most nations have not detailed the causes of these fatalities.\n\nDespite the challenges, Saudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel announced on Tuesday that health plans for the Hajj were successfully implemented, preventing major disease outbreaks and other public health threats, as reported by the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA).\n\nHealth officials provided virtual consultations to over 5,800 pilgrims, primarily for heat-related illnesses, enabling prompt intervention and mitigating a potential surge in cases, according to SPA.", "source": {"uri":

Until now I don't have a clue.\"\n\nFacebook and other social media networks have been flooded with pictures of the missing and requests for information.\n\nThose searching for news include family and friends of Ghada Mahmoud Ahmed Dawood, an Egyptian pilgrim unaccounted for since Saturday.\n\n\"I received a call from her daughter in Egypt begging me to put any post on Facebook that can help track her or find her,\" said one family friend based in Saudi Arabia, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to anger Saudi authorities.\n\n\"The good news is that until now we did not find her on the list of the dead people, which gives us hope she is still alive.\"\n\n- Searing heat -\n\nThe hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once.\n\nIts timing is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, shifting forward each year in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nFor the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer.\n\nAccording to a Saudi study published last month, temperatures in the area are rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nIn addition to Egypt, fatalities have also been confirmed by Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nA second Arab diplomat told AFP on Wednesday that Jordanian officials were looking for 20 missing pilgrims, though 80 others who were initially reported missing were located in hospitals.\n\nAn Asian diplomat told AFP there were \"around 68 dead\" from India and that others were missing.\n\n\"Some (died) because of natural causes and we had many old-age pilgrims. And some are due to the weather conditions, that's what we assume,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year more than 200 pilgrims were reported dead, most of them from Indonesia.\n\n- 'No news' -\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly official permits.\n\nThis has become easier since 2019 when Saudi Arabia introduced a general tourism visa, said Umer Karim, an expert on Saudi politics at the University of Birmingham.\n\n\"Before, the only people who could have done that were residents of the kingdom, and they know the situation,\" he said.\n\n\"For these tourist visa guys, it's like being on the migrant route without any idea of what to expect.\"\n\nOne of the Arab diplomats who spoke to AFP on Wednesday said many of the dead Egyptians were unregistered.\n\nEven pilgrims who have official permits can be vulnerable, including Houria Ahmad Abdallah Sharif, a 70-year-old Egyptian pilgrim who has been missing since Saturday.\n\nAfter praying on Mount Arafat, she told a friend she wanted to go to a public bathroom to clean her abaya, but she never came back.\n\n\"We've searched for her from door to door and we have not found her until now,\" said the friend, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"We know many who are still searching for their family members and relatives and they are not finding them, or if they are finding them they are finding them dead,\" the friend added.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al-Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

unregistered.\n\nEven pilgrims who have official permits can be vulnerable, including Houria Ahmad Abdallah Sharif, a 70-year-old Egyptian pilgrim who has been missing since Saturday.\n\nAfter praying on Mount Arafat, she told a friend she wanted to go to a public bathroom to clean her abaya, but she never came back.\n\n\"We've searched for her from door to door and we have not found her until now,\" said the friend, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"We know many who are still searching for their family members and relatives and they are not finding them, or if they are finding

They were exhausted,\" AFP quoted an Arab diplomat as saying on Thursday. The person was referring to Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the hajj's climax.\n\nThe diplomat further said the main cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other issues.\n\nIn addition to Egypt and India, fatalities have also been confirmed by Malaysia, Pakistan, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal,

She was tired. She was feeling so hot, and she had no place to sleep,\" he said. \"I looked for her in all the hospitals. Until now I don't have a clue.\"\n\nFacebook and other social media networks have been flooded with pictures of the missing and requests for information.\n\nThose searching for news include family and friends of Ghada Mahmoud Ahmed Dawood, an Egyptian pilgrim unaccounted for since Saturday.\n\n\"I received a call from her daughter in Egypt begging me to put any post on Facebook that can help track her or find her,\" said one family friend based in Saudi Arabia, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to anger Saudi authorities.\n\n\"The good news is that until now we did not find her on the list of the dead people, which gives us hope she is still alive.\"\n\nThe hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once.\n\nIts timing is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, shifting forward each year in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nFor the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer.\n\nAccording to a Saudi study published last month, temperatures in the area are rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nIn addition to Egypt, fatalities have also been confirmed by Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nA second Arab diplomat told AFP on Wednesday that Jordanian officials were looking for 20 missing pilgrims, though 80 others who were initially reported missing were located in hospitals.\n\nAn Asian diplomat told AFP there were \"around 68 dead\" from India and that others were missing.\n\n\"Some (died) because of natural causes and we had many old-age pilgrims. And some are due to the weather conditions, that's what we assume,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year more than 200 pilgrims were reported dead, most of them from Indonesia.\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly official permits.\n\nThis has become easier since 2019 when Saudi Arabia introduced a general tourism visa, said Umer Karim, an expert on Saudi politics at the University of Birmingham.\n\n\"Before, the only people who could have done that were residents of the kingdom, and they know the situation,\" he said.\n\n\"For these tourist visa guys, it's like being on the migrant route without any idea of what to expect.\"\n\nOne of the Arab diplomats who spoke to AFP on Wednesday said many of the dead Egyptians were unregistered.\n\nEven pilgrims who have official permits can be vulnerable, including Houria Ahmad Abdallah Sharif, a 70-year-old Egyptian pilgrim who has been missing since Saturday.\n\nAfter praying on Mount Arafat, she told a friend she wanted to go to a public bathroom to clean her abaya, but she never came back.\n\n\"We've searched for her from door to door and we have not found her until now,\" said the friend, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"We know many who are still searching for their family members and relatives and they are not finding them, or if they are finding them they are finding them dead,\" the friend added.", "source": {"uri": "geo.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "GEO TV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score":

Saudi officials said on Sunday that more than 2,000 pilgrims have been treated for heat stress, but they did not mention any fatalities and have not provided updated information since Sunday.\n\nAFP's tally of deaths, based on local media sources, stood at 645 on Wednesday. The Arab diplomats who spoke to AFP said 550 bodies were being held at the largest morgue in Mecca.\n\nOf the deaths recorded so far, 323 were Egyptians, and 60 were Jordanians, as confirmed by the Jordanian government. The diplomats said one of the Egyptians \"sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush,\" while the others all died of complications from the heat.\n\nThe Egyptian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that it is working with the Saudis to rescue Egyptians who have gone missing during the hajj. Egyptian officials said \"a certain number of deaths\" have occurred but did not mention any specific numbers.\n\n\"Some pilgrims described seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and ambulance services that appeared overwhelmed at times,\" AFP reported.\n\nThe task of locating the missing and counting the dead is complicated by the large number of pilgrims who enter Mecca illegally because they cannot afford to pay for Saudi visas or because various political problems make it difficult for them to enter Saudi Arabia.\n\nOne of AFP's diplomatic sources said many of the Egyptians who died were \"irregular pilgrims\" who \"went without food, water, or air conditioning for a long time.\"\n\n\"Other countries to report deaths during the hajj this year include Indonesia, Iran, and Senegal,\" AFP added.\n\nThe UK Guardian on Wednesday said friends and family of missing hajj pilgrims have been frantically searching for them in hospitals and pleading for news online. The husband of a missing 70-year-old Tunisian feared the worst because his wife was an \"unregistered\" pilgrim who had no access to air-conditioned facilities after spending hours praying in the sun.\n\n\"She's an old lady. She was tired. She was feeling so hot, and she had no place to sleep. I looked for her in all the hospitals.

at least 550 pilgrims died during the hajj, underscoring the gruelling nature of the pilgrimage which again unfolded in scorching temperatures this year.\n\nAt least 323 of those who died were Egyptians, most of them succumbing to heat-related illnesses, two Arab diplomats coordinating their countries' responses told AFP.\n\n\"All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat\" except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, one of the diplomats said, adding the total figure came from the hospital morgue in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood of Makkah.\n\nAt least 60 Jordanians also died, the diplomats said, up from an official tally of 41 given earlier on Tuesday by Amman.\n\nThe new deaths bring the total reported so far by multiple countries to 577, according to an AFP tally.\n\nThe diplomats said the total at the morgue in Al-Muaisem, one of the biggest in Makkah, was 550.\n\nThe Haj pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month that said temperatures in the area where rituals are performed were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nTemperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) at the Grand Mosque in Makkah on Monday, the Saudi national meteorology centre said.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Egypt's foreign ministry said Cairo was collaborating with Saudi authorities on search operations for Egyptians who had gone missing during the haj.\n\nWhile a ministry statement said \"a certain number of deaths\" had occurred, it did not specify whether Egyptians were among them.\n\nSaudi authorities have reported treating more than 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress but have not updated that figure since Sunday and have not provided information on fatalities.\n\nAt least 240 pilgrims were reported dead by various countries last year, most of them Indonesians.\n\nAFP journalists in Mina, outside Makkah, on Monday saw pilgrims pouring bottles of water over their heads as volunteers handed out cold drinks and fast-melting chocolate ice cream to help them keep cool.\n\nSaudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nBut many of the haj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime.\n\nSome pilgrims described seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and ambulance services that appeared overwhelmed at times.\n\nAround 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the haj this year, 1.6m of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities.\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the haj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly procedures for official hajj visas.\n\nThis places these off-the-books pilgrims at risk as they cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the haj route.\n\nOne of the diplomats who spoke to AFP on Tuesday said that the Egyptian death toll was \"absolutely\" boosted by a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims.\n\n\"Irregular pilgrims caused great chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims' camps, causing the collapse of services,\" said an Egyptian official supervising the country's haj mission.\n\n\"The pilgrims went without food, water, or air conditioning for a long time.\"\n\nThey died \"from the heat because most people had no place\" to take shelter.\n\nEarlier this month, Saudi officials said they had cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Makkah ahead of the haj.\n\nOther countries to report deaths during the haj this year include Indonesia, Iran and Senegal.\n\nMost countries have not specified how many deaths were heat-related.\n\nSaudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel said on Tuesday that health plans for the haj had \"been successfully carried out\", preventing major outbreaks of disease and other public health threats, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.\n\nHealth officials \"provided virtual consultations to over 5,800 pilgrims, primarily for heat-related illnesses, enabling prompt intervention and mitigating the potential for a surge in cases,\" SPA said.", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawn"}, "authors": [{"uri":

These new figures bring the total deaths reported by multiple countries to 577, as per AFP's count.\n\nThe pilgrimage, a fundamental practice in Islam, is increasingly impacted by climate change, with a recent Saudi study noting a rise in temperatures in the ritual areas.\n\nOn Monday, temperatures soared to 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) at the Grand Mosque in Makkah, as reported by the Saudi national meteorology center.\n\nSaudi efforts included treating over 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress, although specific updates on fatalities have not been provided since Sunday. Last year, various countries reported 240 deaths among pilgrims, predominantly Indonesians.\n\nDuring the hajj rituals, such as prayers on Mount Arafat, pilgrims endured prolonged outdoor exposure despite Saudi advisories to use umbrellas, stay hydrated, and avoid the sun during peak hours.\n\nNonetheless, reports indicated challenges with overwhelmed ambulance services and instances of pilgrims succumbing to extreme heat along the route.\n\nThis year's hajj involved around 1.8 million participants, with 1.6 million from abroad. A significant number attempted the pilgrimage through unofficial channels due to the costs associated with official hajj visas, placing them at greater risk without access to Saudi-provided amenities.\n\nAn Egyptian official highlighted that many unregistered Egyptian pilgrims contributed to chaos in camps, resulting in inadequate services such as food, water, and cooling facilities, which likely exacerbated the death toll from heat-related causes.\n\nSaudi authorities had earlier cleared hundreds of thousands of unauthorized pilgrims from Makkah ahead of the hajj. Countries including Indonesia, Iran, and Senegal also reported deaths during this year's pilgrimage, although specific details on heat-related fatalities were generally not disclosed.\n\nSaudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel noted successful health plans during the hajj, which prevented major outbreaks of disease and managed over 5,800 virtual consultations primarily for heat-related illnesses, ensuring timely medical intervention.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mosque_of_Mecca", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Mosque of Mecca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Arafat", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mount Arafat"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahd_of_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fahd of Saudi Arabia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senegal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Senegal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/592894-HajjAFP-1377029819/592894-HajjAFP-1377029819.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663052", "eventUri": "eng-9663052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

AFP\n\nFriends and family of missing haj pilgrims searched hospitals and pleaded online for news on Wednesday, fearing the worst after hundreds died during the annual rites in Saudi Arabia.\n\nArab diplomats on Tuesday told AFP at least 550 pilgrims died this year, the majority due to heat-related illnesses after temperatures reached 51.8 degrees Celsius in Mecca, Islam's holiest city.\n\nThe total reported dead so far is 645, according to an AFP tally of figures released by various countries. About 1.8 million people attended the pilgrimage.\n\nMabrouka bint Salem Shushana of Tunisia, in her early 70s, has been missing since the climax of the pilgrimage on Saturday at Mount Arafat, her husband Mohammed told AFP on Wednesday.\n\nBecause she was unregistered and did not have an official haj permit, she was unable to access air-conditioned facilities that allow pilgrims to cool off after hours of outdoor prayers, Mohammed said.\n\n\"She's an old lady. She was tired. She was feeling so hot, and she had no place to sleep,\" he said. \"I looked for her in all the hospitals. Until now I don't have a clue.\"\n\nHe is far from the only one desperate for information.\n\nFacebook and other social media networks have been flooded with pictures of the missing and requests for information.\n\nThe searchers include family and friends of Ghada Mahmoud Ahmed Dawood, an Egyptian pilgrim unaccounted for since Saturday.\n\n\"I received a call from her daughter in Egypt begging me to put any post on Facebook that can help track her or find her,\" said one family friend based in Saudi Arabia, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to anger Saudi authorities.\n\n\"The good news is that until now we did not find her on the list of the dead people, which gives us hope she is still alive.\"\n\nThe haj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once.\n\nIts timing is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, shifting forward each year in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nFor the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer.\n\nAccording to a Saudi study published last month, temperatures in the area are rising 0.4 degrees Celsius each decade.\n\nThe figure of 550 dead provided by diplomats on Tuesday came from the hospital morgue in Mecca's Al-Muaisem neighbourhood, one of the biggest in the city.\n\nIt includes 323 Egyptians and 60 Jordanians, said the Arab diplomats, one of whom noted that nearly all the Egyptians died \"because of heat\".\n\nFatalities have also been confirmed by Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nOn Wednesday an Asian diplomat told AFP there were \"around 68 dead\" from India and that others were missing.\n\n\"Some (died) because of natural causes and we had many old-age pilgrims. And some are due to the weather conditions, that's what we assume,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year more than 200 pilgrims were reported dead, most of them from Indonesia.\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the haj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly official permits.\n\nThis has become easier since 2019 when Saudi Arabia introduced a general tourism visa, said Umer Karim, an expert on Saudi politics at the University of Birmingham.\n\n\"Before, the only people who could have done that were residents of the kingdom, and they know the situation,\" he said.\n\n\"For these tourist visa guys, it's like being on the migrant route without any idea of what to expect.\"\n\nEven pilgrims who have official permits can be vulnerable, including Houria Ahmad Abdallah Sharif, a 70-year-old Egyptian pilgrim who has been missing since Saturday.\n\n\"We've searched for her from door to door and we have not found her until now,\" said the friend, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"We know many who are still searching for their family members and relatives and they are not finding them, or if they are finding them they are finding them dead,\" the friend added.",

The current official death toll according to the morgue is listed at 550.\n\nThe diplomats also reported that at least 60 Jordanians have died, up from the previously reported 41 as of Tuesday. These new fatalities bring the total number reported by various countries to 577.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Egypt's foreign ministry announced it was working with Saudi authorities to search for Egyptians missing during the Hajj.

A recent Saudi study indicated that the pilgrimage is increasingly impacted by climate change, with temperatures in the area rising by 0.4\u00b0C each decade. According to the Saudi National Meteorology Centre, temperatures at the Grand Mosque in Mecca reached 51.8\u00b0C this past Monday.\n\nPilgrims were observed pouring water over their heads while volunteers distributed cold drinks and quickly melting chocolate ice cream to help them stay cool. Saudi officials advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water, and avoid the sun during the hottest parts of the day.\n\nHowever, many Hajj rituals, such as the prayers on Mount Arafat on Saturday, require prolonged outdoor exposure.\n\nSome pilgrims reported seeing motionless bodies along the roadside and described ambulance services as overwhelmed at times. According to Saudi authorities, roughly 1.8 million pilgrims participated in this year's Hajj, with 1.6 million coming from abroad.\n\nEach year, tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt the Hajj without official visas to save money, a dangerous practice as these unregistered pilgrims cannot access the air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the Hajj route.\n\nOne diplomat noted that the high number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims contributed to the high Egyptian death toll.\n\nEarlier this month, Saudi officials reported clearing hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca before the Hajj.

They were exhausted,\" one Arab diplomat told AFP on Thursday, referring to Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the hajj's climax.\n\nThe diplomat said the principal cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other issues.\n\nIn addition to Egypt, fatalities have also been confirmed by Malaysia, Pakistan, India, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nFriends and family members have been searching for pilgrims who are still missing.\n\nOn Wednesday they scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst during the scorching temperatures.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided

They were exhausted,' one Arab diplomat said on Thursday, referring to Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the Hajj's climax.\n\nThe diplomat said the main cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other issues.\n\nEgyptian officials were visiting hospitals to obtain data on Egyptian pilgrims and help those still alive to get medical care, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n'However, there are large numbers of Egyptian citizens who are not registered in Hajj databases, which requires double the effort and a longer time to search for missing persons and find their relatives,' the ministry said.\n\nIn addition to Egypt, new fatalities were confirmed on Thursday by Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nOut of around 150,000 pilgrims, Pakistan has so far recorded 58 deaths, a diplomat briefed on the tally said.\n\n'I think given the number of people, given the weather, this is just natural,' the diplomat said.\n\nIndonesia, which had around 2,40,000 pilgrims, raised its death toll to 183, according to the ministry of religious affairs, compared with 313 deaths recorded last year.\n\nDeaths have also been confirmed by Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region. In many cases, authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nMeanwhile, friends and family members have been searching for pilgrims who are still missing.\n\nOn Wednesday they scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst during the scorching temperatures.\n\nTwo diplomats said on Thursday that Saudi authorities had begun the burial process for dead pilgrims, which involves cleaning up the bodies, putting them in white burial cloth and taking them to be interred in individual graves.\n\n'The burial is done by the Saudi authorities. They have their own system so we just follow that,' said one diplomat, who pointed out that his country was working to notify loved ones of the dead as best it could.\n\nThe other diplomat said that given the number of fatalities it would be impossible to notify many families ahead of time, especially in Egypt which accounts for so many of the dead.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of 'heat exhaustion' on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year various countries reported more than 300 deaths during the Hajj, mostly Indonesians.\n\nThe timing of the Hajj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.\n\nA 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for Hajj pilgrims will exceed the 'extreme danger threshold' from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, 'with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses'.\n\nHosting the Hajj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's official title includes the words 'Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques', in Makkah and Medina.\n\nThe Hajj has been the scene of a number of stampedes and fires over the years, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the 'stoning the devil' ritual in Mina, near Makkah, killed up to 2,300 people in the event's mostly deadly disaster.", "source": {"uri": "newagebd.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Age | The Most Popular Outspoken English Daily

She was tired. She was feeling so hot, and she had no place to sleep,\" he said. \"I looked for her in all the hospitals. Until now I don't have a clue.\"\n\nFacebook and other social media networks have been flooded with pictures of the missing and requests for information.\n\nThose searching for news include family and friends of Ghada Mahmoud Ahmed Dawood, an Egyptian pilgrim unaccounted for since Saturday.\n\n\"I received a call from her daughter in Egypt begging me to put any post on Facebook that can help track her or find her,\" said one family friend based in Saudi Arabia, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to anger Saudi authorities.\n\n\"The good news is that until now we did not find her on the list of the dead people, which gives us hope she is still alive.\"\n\nThe hajj is one of Islam's five pillars, and all Muslims who have the means must perform it at least once.\n\nIts time is regulated by the Islamic lunar calendar, which moves forward every year in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nFor the past several years, the majority of outdoor rites have occurred during the hot Saudi summer.\n\nAccording to a Saudi study published last month, temperatures in the area are rising by 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade.\n\nIn addition to Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region have acknowledged casualties, though authorities have often not explained the cause.\n\nA second Arab ambassador told AFP on Wednesday that Jordanian officials were seeking for 20 missing pilgrims, while 80 others who were initially reported missing had been found in hospitals.\n\nAn Asian ambassador told AFP that there were \"around 68 dead\" in India, with more missing.\n\n\"Some perished due to natural causes, and we had many elderly pilgrims. And some are due to weather conditions, we believe,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not published numbers on fatalities, but it did disclose over 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year, more than 200 pilgrims were reported dead, the most of whom were from Indonesia.\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly official permits.\n\nThis has become easier since 2019 when Saudi Arabia introduced a general tourism visa, said Umer Karim, an expert on Saudi politics at the University of Birmingham.\n\n\"Before, the only people who could have done that were residents of the kingdom, and they know the situation,\" he said.\n\n\"For these tourist visa guys, it's like being on the migrant route without any idea of what to expect.\"\n\nOne of the Arab diplomats who spoke to AFP on Wednesday said many of the dead Egyptians were unregistered.\n\nEven pilgrims who have official permits can be vulnerable, including Houria Ahmad Abdallah Sharif, a 70-year-old Egyptian pilgrim who has been missing since Saturday.\n\nAfter praying on Mount Arafat, she told a friend she wanted to go to a public bathroom to clean her abaya, but she never came back.\n\n\"We've searched for her from door to door and we have not found her until now,\" said the friend, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"We know many who are still searching for their family members and relatives and they are not finding them, or if they are finding them they are finding them dead,\" the

They were exhausted,\" one Arab diplomat told AFP on Thursday, referring to Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the hajj's climax.\n\n- Burials begin -\n\nIn addition to Egypt, new fatalities were confirmed on Thursday by Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nOut of around 150,000 pilgrims, Pakistan has so far recorded 58 deaths, a diplomat briefed on the tally told AFP.\n\n\"I think given the number of people, given the weather, this is just natural,\" the diplomat said.\n\nIndonesia, which had around 240,000 pilgrims, raised its death toll to 183, according to the ministry of religious affairs, compared with 313 deaths recorded last year.\n\nDeaths have also been confirmed by Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region. In many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nOn Wednesday they scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst during the scorching temperatures.\n\nTwo diplomats told AFP on Thursday that Saudi authorities had begun the burial process for dead pilgrims, which involves cleaning up the bodies, putting them in white burial cloth and taking them to be interred in individual graves.\n\n\"The burial is done by the Saudi authorities. They have their own system so we just follow that,\" said one diplomat, who pointed out that his country was working to notify loved ones of the dead as best it could.\n\nThe other diplomat said that given the number of fatalities it would be impossible to notify many families ahead of time, especially in Egypt which accounts for so many of the dead.\n\nLast year various countries reported more than 300 deaths during the hajj, mostly Indonesians.\n\nThe timing of the hajj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.\n\nA 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for hajj pilgrims will exceed the \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, \"with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses\".\n\nHosting the hajj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's official title includes the words \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in Mecca and Medina.\n\nThe hajj has been the scene of a number of stampedes and fires over the years, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the \"stoning the devil\" ritual in Mina, near Mecca, killed up to 2,300 people in the event's mostly deadly disaster.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news",

Mabrouka bint Salem Shushana of Tunisia, in her early 70s, has been missing since the climax of the pilgrimage on Saturday at Mount Arafat, her husband Mohammed told AFP on Wednesday, June 19.\n\nDue to her lack of registration and an official Hajj permit, she was unable to access air-conditioned facilities meant to help pilgrims cope with the heat, he explained.\n\nHis words:\n\n\"She's an elderly woman, exhausted, extremely hot, and without a place to rest,\" he said. \"I have searched all the hospitals for her. Until now, I have no clue about her whereabouts.\"\n\nFacebook and other social media platforms have been flooded with photos of missing individuals and pleas for information, Vanguard reported.\n\nAmong those searching are the family and friends of Ghada Mahmoud Ahmed Dawood, an Egyptian pilgrim unaccounted for since Saturday.\n\nA family friend in Saudi Arabia said:\n\n\"I received a call from her daughter in Egypt, pleading with me to post anything on Facebook that could help locate her or find her,\"\n\n\"The silver lining is that we haven't found her name on the list of deceased, which gives us hope she is still alive.\"\n\nThe Hajj, one of Islam's five pillars, is mandatory for all Muslims who have the means to complete it at least once. Its timing is based on the Islamic lunar calendar, causing it to shift forward each year in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nFor the past few years, the predominantly outdoor rituals have taken place during Saudi Arabia's scorching summer.\n\nAccording to a Saudi study published last month, temperatures in the region are rising by 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nBesides Egypt, fatalities have also been confirmed by Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though specific causes have often not been disclosed.\n\nA second Arab diplomat told AFP on Wednesday that Jordanian officials were searching for 20 missing pilgrims, while 80 others initially reported missing were found in hospitals.\n\nAn Asian diplomat mentioned that:\n\n\"India had \"around 68 dead,\" with some pilgrims still missing. \"Some died due to natural causes, particularly the elderly, while others likely succumbed to the extreme weather conditions.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia has not released information on fatalities but reported over 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year, more than 200 pilgrims, mostly from Indonesia, were reported dead.\n\nEvery year, tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt the Hajj through unofficial channels due to the high cost of official permits.\n\nThis has been facilitated by Saudi Arabia's introduction of a general tourism visa in 2019, explained Umer Karim, a Saudi politics expert at the University of Birmingham.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"Previously, only residents of the kingdom could attempt this, but now tourists, unaware of the challenges, are attempting it.\"\n\nIn another report, over 500 pilgrims have lost their lives during the 2024 Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca amidst scorching

Over half of the fatalities were unregistered worshippers who endured extreme heat conditions while performing the pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia. The latest reported deaths, including 58 from Egypt, underscored the severity of the situation, with 630 out of 658 total Egyptian deaths being unregistered pilgrims.\n\nReports from approximately 10 countries have contributed to the tally of 1,081 deaths during the annual hajj pilgrimage, a fundamental pillar of Islam that all financially capable Muslims are required to complete at least once in their lifetime. Official statements from various countries and information shared by diplomats have provided insights into the magnitude of the tragedy.\n\nThis year's hajj coincided with the sweltering Saudi summer, with temperatures soaring to 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit) at the Grand Mosque in Makkah, as reported by the National Meteorological Center. While Egyptian officials have refrained from confirming AFP's figures, numerous social media videos have depicted distressing scenes of bodies strewn across the streets near the Grand Mosque.\n\nA Saudi study published recently highlighted a concerning trend of rising temperatures in the region, with temperatures increasing by approximately 0.4 degrees Celsius per decade. Despite efforts by Saudi authorities to clear hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca earlier in the month, many still participated in the main hajj rites, which commenced last Friday.\n\nUnregistered pilgrims faced heightened vulnerability to the extreme heat as they lacked access to air-conditioned spaces provided by Saudi authorities for authorized pilgrims. Without official permits, they endured hours of walking and praying outdoors without respite from the scorching temperatures.\n\nAccording to an Arab diplomat, the primary cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was heat-related complications, exacerbating issues such as high blood pressure. Alongside Egypt, countries including Malaysia, Pakistan, India, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, and Iraq's Kurdistan region have reported fatalities, although specific causes have not always been specified.\n\nFamilies and friends continue to search for missing pilgrims, with concerns escalating as temperatures remain dangerously high.

pilgrims died during Haj, mostly Egyptians", "body": "RIIYADH, June 19 -- Diplomats on Tuesday said at least 550 pilgrims died during the Haj, underscoring the gruelling nature of the pilgrimage which again unfolded in scorching temperatures this year.\n\nAt least 323 of those who died were Egyptians, most of them succumbing to heat-related illnesses, two Arab diplomats coordinating their countries' responses told AFP.\n\n\"All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat\" except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, one of the diplomats said, adding the total figure came from the hospital morgue in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood of Mecca.\n\nAt least 60 Jordanians also died, the diplomats said, up from an official tally of 41 given earlier on Tuesday by Amman.\n\nThe new deaths bring the total reported so far by multiple countries to 577, according to an AFP tally.\n\nThe diplomats said the total at the morgue in Al-Muaisem, one of the biggest in Mecca, was 550.\n\nThe Haj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once.\n\nThe pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month that said temperatures in the area where rituals are performed were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nTemperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday, the Saudi national meteorology centre said.\n\nHeat stress\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Egypt's foreign ministry said Cairo was collaborating with Saudi authorities on search operations for Egyptians who had gone missing during the Haj.\n\nWhile a ministry statement said \"a certain number of deaths\" had occurred, it did not specify whether Egyptians were among them.\n\nSaudi authorities have reported treating more than 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress but have not updated that figure since Sunday and have not provided information on fatalities.\n\nAt least 240 pilgrims were reported dead by various countries last year, most of them Indonesians.\n\nAFP journalists in Mina, outside Mecca, on Monday saw pilgrims pouring bottles of water over their heads as volunteers handed out cold drinks and fast-melting chocolate ice cream to help them keep cool.\n\nSaudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nBut many of the Haj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime.\n\nSome pilgrims described seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and ambulance services that appeared overwhelmed at times.\n\nAround 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the Haj this year, 1.6 million of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities.\n\nUnregistered pilgrims\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the Haj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly procedures for official Haj visas.\n\nThis places these off-the-books pilgrims at risk as they cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the Haj route.\n\nOne of the diplomats who spoke to AFP on Tuesday said that the Egyptian death toll was \"absolutely\" boosted by a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims.\n\n\"Irregular pilgrims caused great chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims' camps, causing the collapse of services,\" said an Egyptian official supervising the country's Haj mission.\n\n\"The pilgrims went without food, water, or air conditioning for a long time.\"\n\nThey died \"from the heat because most people had no place\" to take shelter.\n\nEarlier this month, Saudi officials said they had cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca ahead of the Haj.\n\nOther countries to report deaths during the Haj this year include Indonesia, Iran and Senegal.\n\nMost countries have not specified how many deaths were heat-related.\n\nSaudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel said on Tuesday that health plans for the Haj had \"been successfully carried out\", preventing major outbreaks of disease and other public health threats, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.\n\nHealth officials \"provided virtual consultations to over 5,800 pilgrims, primarily for heat-related illnesses, enabling prompt intervention and mitigating the potential for a surge in cases,\" SPA said. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com",

The temperature at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday reached 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit), according to the Saudi national meteorology centre.\n\nThe majority of the dead were Egyptians, with 323 succumbing primarily to heat-related illnesses.\n\n\"All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat,\" said a diplomat, except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush. The total figure was obtained from the hospital morgue in Mecca's Al-Muaisem neighbourhood.\n\nIn addition to the Egyptian casualties, at least 60 Jordanians also perished during the pilgrimage, bringing the total reported deaths from various countries to 577, according to an AFP tally. The diplomats confirmed that the Al-Muaisem morgue, one of the largest in Mecca, recorded a total of 550 deaths.\n\nSaudi authorities reported treating over 2,000 pilgrims for heat stress but have not provided updated figures or information on fatalities since Sunday.\n\nDespite Saudi officials advising pilgrims to use umbrellas, stay hydrated, and avoid sun exposure during the hottest hours, many hajj rituals require being outdoors for extended periods during the day. Some pilgrims reported seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and overwhelmed ambulance services.\n\nThis year, around 1.8 million pilgrims participated in the hajj, with 1.6 million coming from abroad. However, tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj without securing official visas each year to save money, which is more dangerous as they cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the route.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

At least 323 of the dead were Egyptians, diplomats have said.\n\nTalking to AFP, the two Arab officials said that the pilgrims succumbed to heat-related illnesses. \"All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat\" except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, one of the diplomats said, adding the total figure came from the hospital morgue in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood of Mecca.\n\nTemperatures in the Muslim pilgrim city touched 51.8 degrees Celcius on Monday, according to the National Center for Meteorology.\n\nMost of the rituals of the Hajj, an annual pilgrimage that Muslims are obligated to make at least once in their lifetime, are held outside under the direct sun. Pilgrims are often exposed to extreme heat as they walk around the Kaaba in circles.\n\nAt least 60 Jordanians also died, the diplomats said, up from an official tally of 41 given earlier on Tuesday by Amman.\n\nSome pilgrims described seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and ambulance services that appeared overwhelmed at times.\n\nHajj and heatwave\n\nThe Hajj has been facing the wrath of climate change recently but that is not stopping pilgrims from visiting the holy site. Around 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the hajj this year, 1.6 million of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities.\n\nStudies suggest that increasing humidity and temperatures pose a threat to the health of pilgrims. Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles predict that the annual pilgrimage could turn more dangerous from 2047 to 2052 and from 2079 to 2086 during the hottest months of the year.\n\nUnregistered pilgrims\n\nThousands of unregistered Muslims who often cannot afford the costly procedures for official visas attempt to perform the hajj via irregular channels. These pilgrims are the ones who are inadvertently affected more by the heat conditions as they do not have access to air-conditioned services and facilities.\n\nOne of the diplomats who spoke to AFP on Tuesday said that the Egyptian death toll was \"absolutely\" boosted by a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims.\n\n\"Irregular pilgrims caused great chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims' camps, causing the collapse of services,\" said an Egyptian official supervising the country's hajj mission.\n\n\"The pilgrims went without food, water, or air conditioning for a long time.\"\n\nThey died \"from the heat because most people had no place\" to take shelter.\n\nWhat's the authority doing?\n\nSaudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nExperts have also recommended putting a cap on the number of visitors and allowing only those pilgrims who are in the best of health.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities are also doing the best they can to ensure maximum comfort to pilgrims by providing cold water, installing large umbrellas with mist fans and setting up hospitals to treat heat-related illnesses.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

This underscores how difficult the journey is, particularly in the sweltering heat. Once again, the oppressive heat has been a major factor, since this year's pilgrimage took place in extremely hot weather.\n\nHigh Death Toll Among Egyptians\n\nAt least 323 Egyptians died out of the 550 total, primarily from heat-related illnesses, according to two Arab ambassadors who oversaw their nations' reactions. One ambassador stated that all Egyptian deaths were due to the heat, with the exception of one Egyptian who passed away from wounds received in a small crowd crush. The hospital mortuary in the Mecca neighbourhood of Al-Muaisem verified this number.\n\nIncrease in Jordanian Deaths\n\nThe ambassadors also mentioned that 60 Jordanians had passed away, which was more than the official toll of 41 that Amman had earlier announced. According to an AFP count, with these additional numbers, the total number of deaths recorded by different nations has reached 577. One of Mecca's biggest mortuaries, Al-Muaisem, announced 550 fatalities in all.\n\nImpact of Climate Change on Hajj\n\nThe Hajj pilgrimage, a vital practice in Islam, requires all Muslims with the means to perform it at least once. However, climate change has increasingly impacted the pilgrimage. A Saudi study published last month indicated that temperatures in the area where rituals are performed have been rising by 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade. On Monday, temperatures soared to 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, as reported by the Saudi national meteorology center.\n\nHeat Stress and Health Challenges\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Egypt's foreign ministry stated that Cairo was working with Saudi authorities to find Egyptians who went missing during the Hajj. While the ministry acknowledged \"a certain number of deaths,\" it did not clarify if Egyptians were among them. Saudi authorities have treated over 2,000 pilgrims for heat stress but have not updated this figure since Sunday, nor have they provided information on fatalities.\n\nLast year, 240 pilgrims died, most of them Indonesians. This year, AFP journalists in Mina, outside Mecca, observed pilgrims pouring water over their heads while volunteers distributed cold drinks and quickly melting chocolate ice cream to help them stay cool. Saudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water, and avoid the sun during the hottest parts of the day. However, many Hajj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat, require being outdoors for extended periods during the day.\n\nStruggles of Unregistered Pilgrims\n\nEach year, many pilgrims attempt the Hajj without official visas due to the high costs, putting them at significant risk as they lack access to air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities. A diplomat mentioned that the high number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims \"absolutely\" increased the death toll. An Egyptian official overseeing the country's Hajj mission stated that these irregular pilgrims caused chaos in the camps, leading to a collapse of services. Many went without food, water, or air conditioning, ultimately succumbing to the heat.\n\nEfforts to Manage the Crisis\n\nEarlier this month, Saudi officials cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca ahead of the Hajj. Other countries, including Indonesia, Iran, and Senegal, have also reported deaths during this year's pilgrimage, though most have not specified if these were heat-related.\n\nAccording to the official Saudi Press Agency, Saudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel declared on Tuesday that the Hajj health plans were effectively carried out, averting significant illness outbreaks and other public health hazards. More than 5,800 virtual consultations were given by health experts, primarily for ailments associated to heat waves, to ensure early management and avoid a spike in cases.", "source": {"uri":

this years Hajj | AVA", "body": "Afghan Voice Agency (AVA) - Monitoring: At least 323 of those who died were Egyptians, most of them succumbing to heat-related illnesses, two Arab diplomats coordinating their countries' responses told AFP.\n\n\"All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat\" except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush, one of the diplomats said, adding the total figure came from the hospital morgue in the Al-Muaisem neighborhood of Makkah.\n\nAt least 60 Jordanians also died, the diplomats said, up from an official tally of 41 given earlier on Tuesday by Amman.\n\nThe new deaths bring the total reported so far by multiple countries to 577, according to an AFP tally.\n\nThe diplomats said the total at the morgue in Al-Muaisem, one of the biggest in Makkah, was 550.\n\nThe Haj pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month that said temperatures in the area where rituals are performed were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nTemperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) at the Grand Mosque in Makkah on Monday, the Saudi national meteorology center said.\n\nHeat stress\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Egypt's foreign ministry said Cairo was collaborating with Saudi authorities on search operations for Egyptians who had gone missing during the haj.\n\nWhile a ministry statement said \"a certain number of deaths\" had occurred, it did not specify whether Egyptians were among them.\n\nSaudi authorities have reported treating more than 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress but have not updated that figure since Sunday and have not provided information on fatalities.\n\nAt least 240 pilgrims were reported dead by various countries last year, most of them Indonesians.\n\nAFP journalists in Mina, outside Makkah, on Monday saw pilgrims pouring bottles of water over their heads as volunteers handed out cold drinks and fast-melting chocolate ice cream to help them keep cool.\n\nSaudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nBut many of the haj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime.\n\nSome pilgrims described seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and ambulance services that appeared overwhelmed at times.\n\nAround 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the haj this year, 1.6m of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities.\n\nUnregistered pilgrims\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the haj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly procedures for official hajj visas.\n\nThis places these off-the-books pilgrims at risk as they cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the haj route.\n\nOne of the diplomats who spoke to AFP on Tuesday said that the Egyptian death toll was \"absolutely\" boosted by a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims.\n\n\"Irregular pilgrims caused great chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims' camps, causing the collapse of services,\" said an Egyptian official supervising the country's haj mission.\n\n\"The pilgrims went without food, water, or air conditioning for a long time.\"\n\nThey died \"from the heat because most people had no place\" to take shelter.\n\nEarlier this month, Saudi officials said they had cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Makkah ahead of the haj.\n\nOther countries to report deaths during the haj this year include Indonesia, Iran and Senegal.\n\nMost countries have not specified how many deaths were heat-related.\n\nSaudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jalajel said on Tuesday that health plans for the haj had \"been successfully carried out\", preventing major outbreaks of disease and other public health threats, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.\n\nHealth officials \"provided virtual consultations to over 5,800 pilgrims, primarily for heat-related illnesses, enabling prompt intervention and mitigating the potential for a surge in cases,\" SPA said./Dawn", "source": {"uri": "avapress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062e\u0628\u0631\u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0635\u062f\u0627\u06cc

About 1.8 million people attended the pilgrimage.\n\nMabrouka bint Salem Shushana of Tunisia, in her early 70s, has been missing since the climax of the pilgrimage on Saturday at Mount Arafat, her husband Mohammed said on Wednesday.\n\nBecause she was unregistered and did not have an official Hajj permit, she was unable to access air-conditioned facilities that allow pilgrims to cool off after hours of outdoor prayers, Mohammed said.\n\n'She's an old lady. She was tired. She was feeling so hot, and she had no place to sleep,' he said. 'I looked for her in all the hospitals. Until now I don't have a clue.'\n\nHe is far from the only one desperate for information.\n\nFacebook and other social media networks have been flooded with pictures of the missing and requests for information.\n\nThe searchers include family and friends of Ghada Mahmoud Ahmed Dawood, an Egyptian pilgrim unaccounted for since Saturday.\n\n'I received a call from her daughter in Egypt begging me to put any post on Facebook that can help track her or find her,' said one family friend based in Saudi Arabia.\n\n'The good news is that until now we did not find her on the list of the dead people, which gives us hope she is still alive.'\n\nThe Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once.\n\nIts timing is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, shifting forward each year in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nFor the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer.\n\nAccording to a Saudi study published last month, temperatures in the area are rising 0.4 degrees Celsius each decade.\n\nThe figure of 550 dead provided by diplomats on Tuesday came from the hospital morgue in Makkah's Al-Muaisem neighbourhood, one of the biggest in the city.\n\nIt includes 323 Egyptians and 60 Jordanians, said the Arab diplomats who briefed AFP on the figures, one of whom noted that nearly all the Egyptians died 'because of heat'.\n\nFatalities have also been confirmed by Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nOn Wednesday an Asian diplomat said there were 'around 68 dead' from India and that others were missing.\n\n'Some died because of natural causes and we had many old-age pilgrims. And some are due to the weather conditions, that's what we assume,' he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of 'heat exhaustion' on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year more than 200 pilgrims were reported dead, most of them from Indonesia.\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the Hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly official permits.\n\nThis has become easier since 2019 when Saudi Arabia introduced a general tourism visa, said Umer Karim, an expert on Saudi politics at the University of Birmingham.\n\n'Before, the only people who could have done that were residents of the kingdom, and they know the situation,' he said.\n\n'For these tourist visa guys, it's like being on the migrant route without any idea of what to expect.'\n\nEven pilgrims who have official permits can be vulnerable, including Houria Ahmad Abdallah Sharif, a 70-year-old Egyptian pilgrim who has been missing since Saturday.\n\nAfter praying on Mount Arafat, she told a friend she wanted to go a public bathroom to clean her abaya, but she never came back.\n\n'We've searched for her from door to door and we have not found her until now,' said the friend.\n\n'We know many who are still searching for their family members and relatives and they are not finding them, or if they are finding them they are finding them dead,' the friend added.", "source": {"uri": "newagebd.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Age | The Most Popular Outspoken English Daily in Bangladesh"}, "authors": [],

They were exhausted,\" one Arab diplomat told AFP on Thursday, referring to Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the hajj's climax.\n\nThe diplomat said the principal cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other issues.\n\nIn addition to Egypt, fatalities have also been confirmed by Malaysia, Pakistan, India, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nFriends and family members have been searching for pilgrims who are still missing.\n\nOn Wednesday they scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst during the scorching temperatures.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nbur/th/it\n\nMore from this section\n\nLuvme Hair PartingMax Glueless Wig Voted Best

Deaths have also been reported among pilgrims from Iran and Senegal.\n\nAll the Egyptians who died on the trip suffered from heat stroke, one Arab diplomat told AFP.\n\nSaudi authorities said they have made efforts to reduce the impact of the heat by setting up air conditioned tents and painting the streets between sites white to reflect more sunlight, cutting heat-related deaths by 50 per cent over the past four decades.\n\nHowever, the strength of this year's sun was too overwhelming for many. Witnesses in the city of Mecca this year described seeing motionless bodies lying on the roadside and local emergency services overwhelmed by the number of people in distress.\n\nOn Sunday, Saudi authorities reported treating more than 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress. The figure has not been updated since and they have also not provided information on fatalities.\n\nThe hajj, which ran from Friday to Wednesday, fell during one of the hottest weeks of the year, with local authorities reporting unusually high temperatures.\n\nStudies show that climate change has pushed temperatures in the Gulf desert by up to 0.4C per decade.\n\nThe situation appears to have been exacerbated by the arrival of huge numbers of unregistered visitors, who arrived at the holy site despite with no official hajj visa. This precluded them from accessing the rest stations.\n\nThe Egyptian death toll was \"absolutely\" boosted by a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims, one diplomat said.\n\n\"Irregular pilgrims caused great chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims' camps, causing the collapse of services,\" said an Egyptian official supervising the country's hajj mission.\n\n\"The pilgrims went without food, water, or air conditioning for a long time\" and died \"because they had no place\" to take shelter, he said.\n\nSaudi officials advised pilgrims to drink plenty of water, use umbrellas, and avoid exposure to the sun during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nBut many of the rituals, including prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours at a time during the hottest part of the day.\n\nAround 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the hajj this year, 1.6 million of them coming from abroad, according to Saudi authorities.\n\nThe pilgrimage to Mecca has been the occasion of repeated mass casualty incidents over the years. These have been caused by stampedes, extreme weather, construction failures and disease.\n\nIn 2015, more than 2,000 people died in a stampede near a bridge at the holy site in what is believed to be one of the deadliest hajj events. In the same year a crane collapsed into the Masjid al-Haram mosque, killing more than one hundred.\n\nIn 2023, the pilgrimage also took place in high summer temperatures. At least 240 pilgrims were reported dead by various countries, with the majority being Indonesians, many suffering dehydration and heart failure.\n\nThe final days of the annual hajj coincide with Muslims around the world celebrating the Eid al-Adha holiday.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

"Hajj pilgrim death toll passes 1,000 after brutal 50C heatwave hit world's largest gathering of Muslims in Saudi Arabia", "body": "The death toll at the hajj pilgrim has exceeded 1,000, according to reports, as a brutal heatwave has seen temperatures topping 50C at the world's biggest gathering of Muslims in Saudi Arabia.\n\nHorrifying pictures show bodies being covered and left in the street after they fell victim to the soaring temperatures, while many others suffered severe heatstroke and had to be urgently rushed inside.\n\nUnregistered pilgrims make up more than half of those who have perished, with many unable to access air-conditioned facilities and help from authorities.\n\nThe new deaths reported today include 58 from Egypt, according to an Arab diplomat who provided a breakdown showing that of 658 total dead from that country, 630 were unregistered.\n\nA British Imam described the scenes as 'harrowing' and said that it was impossible for pilgrims to walk through the streets and not to see people suffering from the heat.\n\nA man, affected by the scorching heat, is helped by a member of the Saudi security forces as Muslim pilgrims arrive to perform the symbolic 'stoning of the devil' ritual during the annual hajj pilgrimage in Mina on June 16, 2024\n\nA man, suffering from apparent heatstroke, is helped by another Muslim pilgrim earlier this week\n\nMuslim pilgrims use umbrellas to shade themselves from the sun as they arrive at the base of Mount Arafat, also known as Jabal al-Rahma or Mount of Mercy, during the hajj pilgrimage\n\n'There are so many stories from the pilgrims who are with me about what they saw in the streets, particularly last Sunday,' he told the BBC on Sunday.\n\n'As you were walking, you could not walk 20 yards except you would see someone struggling in the heat.\n\n'People were doing whatever they could to shade themselves, they were taking water from kind individuals who were giving them towels, they were taking shade in hotel receptions.\n\n'It was harrowing at times, I've never seen so many people struggle collectively.'\n\nHe went on to say that while authorities had been on hand to help, they need to learn lessons from the awful scenes caused by the extreme heat, made worse by overcrowding.\n\nAround 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the hajj this year, 1.6 million of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities.\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly procedures for official hajj visas.\n\nThis places these off-the-books pilgrims at risk as they cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the hajj route.\n\nAround 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the hajj this year, 1.6 million of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities\n\nMuslim pilgrims walk under mist dispensers, which Saudi authorities have set up to try to keep people cool\n\n'I think the Saudi authorities perhaps do need to start thinking about controlling the numbers of how many pilgrims come each and every year,' the British Imam said.\n\n'With climate change, with the fact that the pilgrimage happens in the summer months, they really need to look into this in more detail.'\n\nThe pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month that said temperatures in the area where rituals are performed were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nTemperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday, the Saudi national meteorology centre said.\n\nSaudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun, with curfews reportedly put in place at camps telling people not to leave their tents during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nBut many of the hajj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime\n\nFortunately in the coming years the Hajj, the date of which comes 11 days earlier in the Islamic calendar every year, is set to fall in the winter, when temperatures are milder.\n\nMuslim devotees walk around the Kaaba, Islam's holiest shrine, at the Grand Mosque in Saudi Arabia's holy city of Mecca on June 13, 2024\n\nPilgrim deaths are reported every year, not only due to heat but also the difficulty of the walk and the sheer amount of people who undertake it.\n\nThe deadliest incident ever recorded at the pilgrimage was in 2015, when a stampede in the Mina camp killed over 2,400 pilgrims. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede.\n\nA separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster, killed 111 people.\n\nThe second-deadliest incident at Hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Arafat", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mount Arafat"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mina,_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mina, Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mina, Saudi Arabia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mosque_of_Mecca", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Mosque of Mecca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_city", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holy city"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stampede", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stampede"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kaaba"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shrine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrim", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pilgrim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meteorology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663052", "eventUri": "eng-9663052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-06-", "textStart": 1123, "textEnd": 1130}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-06-", "textStart": 4163, "textEnd": 4170}], "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

They were exhausted,\" one Arab diplomat told AFP on Thursday, referring to Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the haj's climax.\n\nThe diplomat said the main cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other issues.\n\nBurials begin\n\nIn addition to Egypt, new fatalities were confirmed on Thursday by Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nOut of around 150,000 pilgrims, Pakistan has so far recorded 58 deaths, a diplomat briefed on the tally told AFP.\n\n\"I think given the number of people, given the weather, this is just natural,\" the diplomat said.\n\nIndonesia, which had around 240,000 pilgrims, raised its death toll to 183, according to the ministry of religious affairs, compared with 313 deaths recorded last year.\n\nDeaths have also been confirmed by Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region. In many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nMeanwhile friends and family members have been searching for pilgrims who are still missing.\n\nOn Wednesday they scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst during the scorching temperatures.\n\nTwo diplomats told AFP on Thursday that Saudi authorities had begun the burial process for dead pilgrims, which involves cleaning up the bodies, putting them in white burial cloth and taking them to be interred in individual graves.\n\n\"The burial is done by the Saudi authorities. They have their own system so we just follow that,\" said one diplomat, who pointed out that his country was working to notify loved ones of the dead as best it could.\n\nThe other diplomat said that given the number of fatalities it would be impossible to notify many families ahead of time, especially in Egypt which accounts for so many of the dead.\n\n'Extreme danger'\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nLast year various countries reported more than 300 deaths during the haj, mostly Indonesians.\n\nThe timing of the haj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.\n\nA 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for haj pilgrims will exceed the \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, \"with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses\".\n\nHosting the haj is a source of prestige for the Saudi royal family, and King Salman's official title includes the words \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in Mecca and Medina.\n\nThe haj has been the scene of a number of stampedes and fires over the years, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the \"stoning the devil\" ritual in Mina, near Mecca, killed up to 2,300 people in the event's mostly deadly disaster.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"},

She was tired. She was feeling so hot, and she had no place to sleep,\" he said. \"I looked for her in all the hospitals. Until now, I don't have a clue.\"\n\nHe is far from the only one desperate for information.\n\nFacebook and other social media networks have been flooded with pictures of the missing and requests for information.\n\nThe searchers include family and friends of Egyptian pilgrim Ghada Mahmoud Ahmed Dawood, unaccounted for since June 15.\n\n\"I received a call from her daughter in Egypt begging me to put any post on Facebook that can help track her or find her,\" said one family friend based in Saudi Arabia, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to anger the Saudi authorities.\n\n\"The good news is that until now we did not find her on the list of the dead people, which gives us hope she is still alive.\"\n\nThe haj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once.\n\nIts timing is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, shifting forward each year in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nFor the past several years, the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer.\n\nAccording to a Saudi study published in May, temperatures in the area are rising 0.4 deg C each decade.\n\nThe figure of 550 dead provided by diplomats on June 18 came from the hospital morgue in Mecca's Al-Muaisem neighbourhood, one of the biggest in the city.\n\nIt includes 323 Egyptians and 60 Jordanians, said the Arab diplomats who briefed AFP on the figures, one of whom noted that nearly all the Egyptians died \"because of heat\".\n\nFatalities have also been confirmed by Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\n\"Some (died) because of natural causes and we had many old-age pilgrims. And some are due to the weather conditions, that's what we assume,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on June 16 alone.\n\nIn 2023, more than 200 pilgrims were reported dead, most of them from Indonesia.\n\nEach year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the haj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly official permits.\n\nThis has become easier since 2019, when Saudi Arabia introduced a general tourism visa, said Mr Umer Karim, an expert on Saudi politics at the University of Birmingham.\n\n\"Before, the only people who could have done that were residents of the kingdom, and they know the situation,\" he said.\n\n\"For these tourist visa guys, it's like being on the migrant route without any idea of what to expect.\"\n\nEven pilgrims who have official permits can be vulnerable, including Egyptian pilgrim Houria Ahmad Abdallah Sharif, 70, who has been missing since June 15.\n\nAfter praying on Mount Arafat, she told a friend she wanted to go a public bathroom to clean her abaya, but she never came back.\n\n\"We've searched for her from door to door and we have not found her until now,\" said the friend, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"We know many who are still searching for their family members and relatives and they are not finding them, or if they are finding them they are finding them dead,\" the friend added. - AFP", "source": {"uri": "tnp.straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Paper"},

The figures have come via official statements or from diplomats working on their countries' responses, reported AFP.\n\nThe dates and timings of the hajj are determined by the lunar Islamic calendar, and once again, it fell during the sweltering summer of Saudi Arabia. Earlier this week, weather agencies reported a temperature of over 51 degrees Celsius in the Grand Mosque in Mecca.\n\nAccording to a Saudi study published last month, temperatures in the area are rising 0.4 degrees Celsius each decade.\n\nWhile this year the Saudi authorities cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims for hajj, it was reported that many of them still participated in the pilgrimage without proper permits. Since unregistered pilgrims did not have access to air-conditioned areas and other facilities, they were the most susceptible to the heatwave.\n\n\"People were tired after being chased by security forces before Arafat day. They were exhausted,\" one Arab diplomat told AFP on Thursday, referring to Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the hajj's climax.\n\nThe main cause of death for majority of the pilgrims was the extreme heat, which triggered complications linked to high blood pressure, cardiovascular issued and other problems.\n\nIn addition to Egypt, fatalities have also been confirmed by Malaysia, Pakistan, India, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.", "source": {"uri":

On Wednesday, the agency said burial permits had been issued for 41 Jordanian pilgrims in Mecca, but did not provide details on the causes of death.\n\nTunisia's Foreign Ministry said at least 35 Tunisians had died, the state-run Agence Tunis Afrique Presse reported Tuesday, noting the \"sharp rise in temperatures\" and \"scorching sun\" that had accompanied the hajj.\n\nAt least 13 people from India's Kerala state died performing hajj, according to Sathyapalan C., a local official, while the Russian state news agency TASS reported the deaths of four citizens from \"natural causes related to health and age.\" Three pilgrims from Senegal also died, according to a statement from the country's Foreign Ministry, without citing a cause of death.\n\nAnd Egypt's Foreign Ministry said consular staff in Saudi Arabia were working \"around the clock\" to help facilitate burials and searches for missing Egyptian pilgrims, without giving a number. Egypt's Ministry of Immigration has set up an \"operations room\" amid numerous distress calls about missing relatives, the State Information Service said in a statement. It added that officials were visiting hospitals and medical centers in Saudi Arabia to search for any missing pilgrims and to assist with repatriating the dead.\n\nSaudi ministries did not immediately respond to questions about the reports of deaths.\n\nMuslims travel to Mecca from around the world each year to perform the five-day pilgrimage, which ends Wednesday. The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam; all Muslims who are financially and physically able must perform the ritual at least once in their lives.\n\nMore than 1.8 million people made the pilgrimage this year, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics, with 1.6 million coming from abroad.\n\nThe first hajj took place in 632. The pilgrimage is now one of the world's largest Muslim gatherings. Over the years, it has been plagued by a number of calamities, including stampedes, fires and outbreaks of disease. A stampede on a bridge in 2006 killed more than 300 people and another in 2015 killed more than 2,200 people.\n\nMany pilgrims, who are often older, have also experienced heat stress in recent years, with scores dying from the heat. Saudi authorities had taken measures to reduce the risk of heat stress, including setting up hydration stations and using water mist sprays to cool the air.\n\nOn Tuesday, Saudi officials billed this year's hajj season a \"success,\" with state media reporting that the health minister, Fahd al-Jalajel, expressed \"particular satisfaction with the fact that there were no outbreaks or other public health threats despite the significant number of pilgrims and the challenges posed by high temperatures.\"\n\nThe authorities also cited \"advanced cooling systems\" and the \"consistent

And some are due to the weather conditions, that's what we assume,\" AFP reported, citing an unnamed diplomat in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe diplomat who confirmed the Indian fatalities said there were also some Indian pilgrims missing, but he declined to provide an exact number.\n\nThe news about Indian casualties came amid friends and family searching for missing pilgrims on Wednesday as the death toll at the annual rituals, which were carried out in scorching heat, surged past 900.\n\nRelatives scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst after temperatures hit 51.8\u00b0C (125\u00b0F) in Mecca, Islam's holiest city, on Monday.\n\nAbout 1.8 million people from all over the world, many old and infirm, took part in the days-long, mostly outdoor pilgrimage.\n\nAn Arab diplomat told AFP that deaths among Egyptians alone had jumped to \"at least 600\", from more than 300 a day earlier, mostly from the unforgiving heat.\n\nThat figure brought the total reported dead so far to 922, according to an AFP tally of figures released by various countries.\n\nFatalities have also been confirmed by Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nLast year more than 200 pilgrims were reported dead, most of them from Indonesia.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nFor the past several years the Hajj has fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer.\n\nAccording to a

Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede.\n\nA separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster, killed 111 people.\n\nThe second-deadliest incident at Hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diplomat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrim", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pilgrim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mosque_of_Mecca", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Mosque of Mecca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Arafat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mount Arafat"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stampede", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stampede"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mina,_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mina, Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mina, Saudi Arabia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rewrite-this-title-Hajj-pilgrim-death-toll-passes-1000-after.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663052", "eventUri": "eng-9663052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4745098039215686, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

They were exhausted,\" one Arab diplomat told AFP on Thursday, referring to Saturday's day-long outdoor prayers that marked the Haj's climax.\n\nThe diplomat said the principal cause of death among Egyptian pilgrims was the heat, which triggered complications related to high blood pressure and other issues.\n\nIn addition to Egypt, fatalities have also been confirmed by Malaysia, Pakistan, India, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, though in many cases authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nFriends and family members have been searching for pilgrims who are still missing.\n\nOn Wednesday, they scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst during the scorching temperatures.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided

One storage facility was on fire and flames crept into a boat dry dock and across fields of dry grass and olive trees, images on local TV showed.\n\nThere were no reports of deaths or injuries, a fire service official told Reuters. Civil protection and authorities evacuated two nearby villages.\n\n\"Its a very difficult day today. We have a new fire breaking out every 10 minutes,\" Fire Service spokesman Vassilis Vathrakogiannis said in a televised message.\n\nWildfires are common in the Mediterranean nation but they have become more devastating as summers have become hotter and drier, which scientists relate to climate change.\n\nOn Tuesday more than 40 fires broke out across the country, the fire service said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what caused today's blaze. Four firefighting planes, six helicopters, dozens of fire engines and more than 50 firefighters were dispatched to the scene, the fire service official said.\n\nMuch of the Athens area has had no rain for weeks, leaving large areas bone dry. Volunteers and professional firefighters dragged hoses over blackened fields in 35C heat. Smoke filled the sky and was driven sideways by strong wind gusts.\n\n\"I saved my home at the last moment. It all happened so fast,\" a resident whose face was blackened by smoke told local Skai TV channel.\n\nAfter forest fires last year forced 19,000 people to flee the island of Rhodes and killed 20 in

these off-the-books pilgrims at risk as they cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the hajj route.\n\n'I think the Saudi authorities perhaps do need to start thinking about controlling the numbers of how many pilgrims come each and every year,' the British Imam said.\n\n'With climate change, with the fact that the pilgrimage happens in the summer months, they really need to look into this in more detail.'\n\nThe pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month that said temperatures in the area where rituals are performed were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade.\n\nTemperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday, the Saudi national meteorology centre said.\n\nA Muslim pilgrim splashes water on his head to cools off at the base of Saudi Arabia's Mount Arafat\n\nMuslim pilgrims walk under mist dispensers, which

pours cold water from a bottle on her head to cool off as she waits in Saudi Arabia's holy city of Mecca on June 20, 2024\n\nSaudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun, with curfews reportedly put in place at camps telling people not to leave their tents during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nBut many of the hajj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime.\n\nSaudi authorities reported clearing hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Mecca this month, but it appears many still participated in the main rites which began last Friday.\n\nThe new deaths reported include 58 from Egypt , according to an Arab diplomat who provided a breakdown showing that of 658 total dead from that country, 630 were unregistered.\n\nOne of the diplomats who spoke to AFP earlier in the week said that the Egyptian death toll was 'absolutely' boosted by a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims.\n\nIn the coming years the Hajj, the date of which comes 11 days earlier in the Islamic calendar every year, is set to fall in the winter, when temperatures are milder.\n\nThe pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month\n\nPilgrims in Mecca have been pictured pouring

also the difficulty of the walk and the sheer amount of people who undertake it.\n\nThe deadliest incident ever recorded at the pilgrimage was in 2015, when a stampede in the Mina camp killed over 2,400 pilgrims. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede.\n\nA separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster, killed 111 people.\n\nThe second-deadliest incident at Hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The pilgrimage began on Friday.\n\nSaudi state TV said temperatures rose on Monday as high as 51.8 degrees Celsius (125.2 Fahrenheit) in the shade at the Grand Mosque in Makkah.\n\nA 2024 study by the Journal of Travel and Medicine found that rising global temperatures may outpace strategies to deal with the heat. A 2019 study by Geophysical Research Letters said that as temperatures rise in arid Saudi Arabia due to climate change, pilgrims performing hajj will face \"extreme danger\".\n\nThirty-five Tunisian citizens have died during the hajj, Tunisian news agency Tunis Afrique Presse said on Tuesday.\n\nMany of those deaths were due to extreme heat, family members said on social media, as other families continued to search for missing relatives in Saudi hospitals.\n\nThe Jordanian foreign ministry said it had issued 41 burial permits for Jordanian pilgrims on Tuesday. Earlier, the ministry said at least six Jordanian citizens died of heat stroke during the hajj.\n\nEleven Iranians have died and 24 were hospitalised during the pilgrimage, Iranian state news outlet IRINN said on Tuesday without giving the causes of death.\n\nThree Senegalese citizens also died during hajj, Agence de Presse S\u00e9n\u00e9galaise, said on Monday.\n\nOne hundred and forty-four Indonesian citizens died during the pilgrimage, Indonesian health ministry data showed on Tuesday. The data did not specify if any of the deaths were due to heat stroke.\n\nPHYSICAL EXERTION\n\nThe hajj is an annual pilgrimage that millions of Muslims make to Makkah to perform religious rites as taught by the Prophet Mohammad to his followers 14 centuries ago.\n\nA Saudi health official, speaking to Reuters on Monday, before many of the reports of deaths were issued, said that authorities had not noticed any unusual fatalities among Muslim pilgrims amid the extremely high temperatures.\n\nThe ministry had so far treated more than 2,700 pilgrims who suffered from heat-related illness, he added.\n\n\"Hajj is a difficult task, so you have to exert efforts and perform the rituals even in the conditions of heat and crowding,\" an Egyptian pilgrim told Reuters on Sunday.\n\nPilgrims used umbrellas to protect themselves from the sun, as Saudi authorities warned pilgrims to stay hydrated and avoid being outdoors during the hottest hours between 11am (0800 GMT) and 3pm.\n\nHajj, one of the largest mass gatherings in the world, is a once-in-a-lifetime duty for able-bodied Muslims who can afford it. It will end on Wednesday.\n\nMore than 1.8 million pilgrims were expected to take part this year, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com",

Hundreds of people had lined up at the Emergency Complex in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood in Mecca, trying to get information about their missing family members.\n\nSeveral countries have said some of their pilgrims died because of the heat that swept across the holy sites at Mecca, including Jordan and Tunisia.\n\nThe hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, and all Muslims with the ability to do so are required to complete it at least once. Even in the best conditions, it often comes with a high death toll.\n\nEach year, the hajj draws hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from low-income nations, \"many of whom have had little, if any, pre-hajj health care,\" an article in the April edition of the Journal of Infection and Public Health said. Communicable illnesses can spread among the gathered masses, many of whom saved their entire lives for their trips and can be older with pre-existing health conditions, the paper added.\n\nAccording to the Saudi hajj authorities, more than 1.83 million Muslims are taking part in this year's hajj, including more than 1.6 million pilgrims from 22 countries.\n\nEach year, tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj without securing the required official visa in an attempt to save money. This cost-saving measure doesn't allow them access to the air-conditioned facilities along the hajj route, making the trek that much more dangerous.\n\nA diplomat, speaking to AFP on Tuesday, said a large number of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims \"absolutely\" boosted this year's death toll. It's estimated that at least 320 Egyptian pilgrims have died on the route.\n\nClimate change could make the risk even greater for future pilgrimages. A 2019 study by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the hajj would be held in temperatures exceeding an \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086.\n\nIslam follows a lunar calendar, so the hajj falls around 11 days earlier each year. In 2030, the hajj will occur in April, and over the next several years it will fall in the winter, when weather is cooler.\n\nA 2015 stampede in Mina during the hajj killed more than 2,400 pilgrims, the deadliest incident to ever strike the pilgrimage, an Associate Press count showed. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster, killed 111 people.\n\nThe second-deadliest incident at hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Pillars_of_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Five Pillars of Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mosque_of_Mecca", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Mosque of Mecca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lunar calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stampede", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stampede"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mina,_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mina, Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mina, Saudi Arabia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2157179569.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663052", "eventUri": "eng-9663052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Those pilgrims who are unregistered have suffered the worst, being unable to access air-conditioned facilities and help from authorities.\n\nThe latest death toll includes 58 from Egypt, according to an Arab diplomat who provided a breakdown showing that of 658 total dead from that country, 630 were unregistered. A British Imam said the scene were \"harrowing\" and pilgrims walking through the streets were being confronted with those suffering from the heat. He told the BBC: \"There are so many stories from the pilgrims who are with me about what they saw in the streets, particularly last Sunday.\"\n\nAdding: \"As you were walking, you could not walk 20 yards except you would see someone struggling in the heat. People were doing whatever they could to shade themselves, they were taking water from kind individuals who were giving them towels, they were taking shade in hotel receptions.It was harrowing at times, I've never seen so many people struggle collectively.\"\n\nThe Imam blamed overcrowding, but also said authorities needed to learn lessons from what had happened. Around 1.8million pilgrims took part in the hajj this year, 1.6million of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities. Each year tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the hajj through irregular channels as they cannot afford the often costly procedures for official hajj visas.\n\nThe pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month that said temperatures in the area where rituals are performed were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade. Temperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday, the Saudi national meteorology centre said.\n\nSaudi officials had advised pilgrims to protect themselves from the sun by using umbrellas, drinking plenty of water and avoiding exposure to the sun, with curfews reportedly put in place at camps telling people not to leave their tents during the hottest hours of the day. But many of the hajj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime. In the coming years the date for Hajj, will come 11 days earlier in the Islamic calendar every year and will eventually fall in the winter, when temperatures are milder.\n\nPilgrim deaths are reported every year with the heat and overcrowding being the main concern. The deadliest incident ever recorded at the pilgrimage was in 2015, when a stampede in the Mina camp killed over 2,400 pilgrims. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque, which preceded the Mina disaster, killed 111 people.

The pilgrimage is performed mostly outdoors and takes days to complete.\n\nThe ministry says it has started to take measures to transport the bodies of the deceased back to Egypt.\n\nSocial media users shared videos from the pilgrimage, showing many people laying down on the floor after struggling to cope in the heat. The videos showed some of the people receiving medical attention.\n\nThe kingdom has implemented heat mitigation measures, including climate-controlled areas. It distributes water, and offers advice to pilgrims on protecting themselves from the sun.\n\nHowever, Saudi authorities have reported that they have treated over 2,000 pilgrims suffering from heat stress on Sunday. They are yet to provide updated information since then.\n\n'Negligence'\n\nOnline, social media users criticised Saudi authorities, accusing them of negligence of pilgrims.\n\nMany used the Arabic-language hashtag #The_Egyptian_Pilgrims to share images and videos of people struggling in the heat.\n\n\"Hundreds of Egyptian pilgrims died when throwing stones at Jamarat [the ritual stoning of a representation of the devil during the Hajj], and the Saudi government is keeping the disaster a secret. Eyewitnesses say that they saw the bodies of pilgrims dumped in the streets amid the complete absence of medical and ambulance teams,\" one social media user alleged.\n\n\"Pilgrims are not dying from overcrowding but rather from poor organisation and negligence. There have been hundreds of deaths of pilgrims of different nationalities,\" another claimed.\n\nThe New Arab cannot verify any of the allegations.\n\nOthers called it a widespread disaster and used social media platforms to advise others on what to do if they have missing family members, instructing them to have their visa and passport information ready.\n\nAt least 60 Jordanians have also died according to diplomats, an increased from the tally of 14 given on Tuesday by Amman.\n\nIranian Red Crescent chief Pirhossein Koolivand added \"five Iranian pilgrims have lost their lives so far in Mecca and Medina during the hajj this year\", without saying how they died.\n\nHajj is being increasingly affected by climate change, with the UN's intergovernmental panel on climate change warning parts of the Gulf could become uninhabitable by the end of the century.\n\nMore than 10,000 heat-related illnesses were recorded last year, 10 percent of them heat stroke, a Saudi official told AFP this week.\n\nA Saudi study said regional temperatures were rising by 0.4 C each decade, and worsening heat may be outpacing mitigation measures.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news",

The Guardian newspaper reported Thursday that more than 1,000 pilgrims from different countries had died.\n\nIn a statement announcing the formation of the crisis unit on the orders of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt's cabinet said 28 deaths had been confirmed from a group of 50,752 officially registered Egyptian pilgrims.\n\nMore: As 100 million broil under heat dome, more 'unbearable' temps on the way\n\nThe Egyptian statement gave no toll for unregistered pilgrims, saying Egypt was seeking an accurate inventory of the dead and missing and was coordinating with Saudi counterparts to arrange for the transfer of bodies.\n\nCompanies that had facilitated travel for unregistered pilgrims would be investigated and penalized, the cabinet added.\n\nDangerous heatwaves are scorching cities on four continents as the Northern Hemisphere marks the first day of summer, a sign that climate change may again bring about record-breaking heat that could surpass last summer as the warmest in 2,000 years.\n\nMore: Can you blame heat wave on climate change? Eye-popping numbers suggest so.\n\nCountries around the Mediterranean endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.\n\nA Reuters witness in Saudi Arabia said that during the pilgrimage thousands of pilgrims had lain on the streets, exposed to the sun, on the climb to Mount Arafat, one of the integral rituals of the journey.\n\nThe bodies of dead pilgrims were later covered with Ihram cloth - a simple garb worn by pilgrims - until medical vehicles arrived, the witness said.\n\nThe fifth pillar of Islam, the hajj is mandatory once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it and is the most significant manifestation of Islamic faith and unity. This year's event, which began last Friday, is expected to draw nearly 2 million pilgrims.\n\nClimate scientists have said rising temperatures pose a growing threat to the event, although heat-related

Last year's death toll was around 240.\n\nSaudi authorities have not yet released any official figure, but Egypt is said to have paid the highest price with 658 deaths from heat and heatstroke, but at least 630 were unregistered pilgrims not eligible to participate.\n\nThe religious event has also seen accidents and deaths in the past, as well as outbreaks of communicable diseases like SARS, bird flu, and meningitis.\n\nEvery year, tens of thousands of pilgrims try to perform the Hajj without registering or paying the official permit, which can be costly.\n\nSaudi authorities moved out hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Makkah earlier this month, but many appear to have eluded security checks, joining other pilgrims during the first rites last Friday.\n\nUnregistered pilgrims are more vulnerable to heat and high temperatures because, without an official permit, they cannot access air-conditioned spaces provided by organisers for the more than 1.8 million authorised pilgrims, to cool off after hours of walking and praying outdoors.\n\n\"People were tired after being chased by security forces before Arafat day. They were exhausted,\" one Arab diplomat said today, referring to the outdoor prayer that marked the culmination of the Hajj last Saturday.\n\nAs the leading cause of death, heat can trigger complications like high blood pressure and other cardiovascular problems.\n\nMalaysia, Pakistan, India, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, and Iraqi Kurdistan have all confirmed fatalities among their citizens.\n\nComplicating things is the fact that this year, Hajj fell during the scorching Saudi summer.\n\nSaudi Arabia's national meteorological centre reported a high of 51.8 degrees Celsius earlier this week at the Grand Mosque in Makkah.\n\nAccording to a Saudi study published last month, local temperatures are rising 0.4 degrees Celsius each decade with the future promising even more.\n\nThe Islamic calendar is lunar, so the pilgrimage moves back 10 days each year. Thus, while the Hajj is now moving toward winter, by the 2050s it will coincide with the peak of summer in Saudi Arabia. This could be \"fatal\" as Fahad Saeed, a climate scientist at Pakistan-based Climate Analytics, pointed out.\n\nHeat-related deaths during the major pilgrimage to Makkah are nothing new and have been recorded since the 1400s.\n\nA lack of acclimatisation to higher temperature, intense physical exertion, exposed spaces, and an older population makes pilgrims vulnerable.\n\nMore than 2,000 people suffered from heat stress last year, according to Saudi sources, and the situation will worsen as the planet warms up.\n\nAccording to a 2021 study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, if the world warms by 1.5\u00b0 Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the risk of heatstroke for pilgrims participating in the Hajj will be five times greater.\n\nThe current deaths are thus a foretaste of things to come for tens of millions of Muslims who will undertake the pilgrimage in the coming decades.\n\n\"The hajj has been conducted in a certain way for more than 1,000 years now, and it's always been a hot climate,\" said Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, a scientific advisor at German institute Climate Analytics. \"But ... the climate crisis is adding to the severity of the climate conditions.\"\n\nHence, some rites, Schleussner notes, like the climb to Mount Arafat have become \"incredibly dangerous to human health.\"", "source": {"uri": "asianews.it", "dataType": "news",

He added that this is the lowest percentage of deaths among Egyptian pilgrims in previous years.\n\nHowever, due to the lack of registered data for unregistered pilgrims with the medical mission, it has been challenging to monitor their health conditions, Madbouly affirmed.\n\nHe stressed that \"anyone who facilitated such irregular travel will be held accountable.\"\n\nMadbouly stressed that a consular task force, under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is currently conducting field visits to hospitals in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe task force aims to obtain data on Egyptian pilgrims there, whether receiving treatment or deceased, and cross-referencing it with the information provided by the families of those reported missing.\n\nThe Cabinet affirmed the presence of a significant number of Egyptian pilgrims who are not registered in the official Hajj databases.\n\nThis requires additional effort and time to search for the missing individuals and locate their families, the Cabinet added.\n\nFor this reason, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has dedicated emergency rooms that operate around the clock and can be contacted by citizens.\n\nAccording to an Arab diplomat who spoke to Agence France-Presse (AFP), this year's Hajj season has been marred by the deaths of at least 600 Egyptian pilgrims, primarily due to the extremely high temperatures.\n\nThis brings the total deaths among pilgrims this year to more than 900, according to an AFP tally.\n\nThe diplomat stated that Egyptian officials in the Kingdom has received 1,400 reports of missing pilgrims.\n\nThe Hajj pilgrimage, which took place in the year 1445 AH, attracted nearly 2 million pilgrims who endured scorching heat.\n\nOn Monday, temperatures in Makkah reached a staggering 52 degrees Celsius, as reported by Saudi Arabia's National Center for Meteorology (NCM).\n\nOne of the diplomats interviewed by AFP emphasized that the significant presence of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims this season has played a substantial role in the high death toll among Egyptians.\n\nThe influx of unregistered pilgrims has resulted in a breakdown of service provision.\n\nAn Egyptian official overseeing the country's Hajj mission stated, \"The presence of irregular pilgrims created immense chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims' camps, leading to a collapse in the services provided.\"\n\nHe further explained that the pilgrims were deprived of essential necessities such as food, water, and adequate shelter, which resulted in fatalities due to the extreme heat.", "source": {"uri": "egypttoday.com",

Saudi Arabia is heating 50% faster than the rest of the Northern Hemisphere, and by 2050, The Washington Post and Carbon Plan estimated that temperatures would rise high enough in Mecca to make it dangerous to be in the sun for 182 days a year.\n\n\"Words fail. Words fail,\" the activist group Climate Defiance wrote on social media in response to the deaths.\n\n\"Stop it with your vapid odes to incrementalism. Stop it with your 2050 pledges,\" the group added. \"Humanity is barreling to the brink. Open your eyes!\"\n\n\"For so many, religious rituals are a sacred and central part of their identities,\" the group continued. \"Now merely practicing a faith proves a literal death sentence.\"\n\nMecca is the holiest city in the Islamic religious tradition, and making the Hajj, or pilgrimage, there is one of Islam's Five Pillars. The Hajj always draws hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world, with more than 1.8 million registered pilgrims attending this year. The timing depends on the Islamic calendar, which follows a lunar cycle. In 2024, it fell between June 14 and June 19 in the Gregorian calendar, coinciding with Saudi Arabia's hotter period.\n\n\"The Hajj is considered one of the Five Pillars of Islam, along with belief in Allah, prayer, fasting, and charity. It is intended to be a sacred part of life,\" Climate Defiance wrote. \"Due to profit-driven, fossil-fueled global hearing, it is now a part of death.\"\n\nAt the close of this year's pilgrimage, a total of 1,081 people were reported dead as of Thursday, according to an Agence France-Presse tally based on official statements or diplomats' reports. The majority -- 658 -- were from Egypt, and a Saudi diplomat told AFP that the heat was the primary cause of death.\n\n\"Ambulances were moving nonstop, collecting people left and right,\" pilgrim Ahmad Bahaa, a 37-year-old Egyptian engineer who works in Saudi Arabia, told The Washington Post. \"People were sleeping on the sidewalks... I saw someone right in front of our tent who collapsed and could not even move.\"\n\nIncluding Egypt, deaths were reported from around 10 countries, according to AFP: They included 183 from Indonesia, 58 from Pakistan, as well as fatalities from Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan, and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region. Other countries including Jordan and Tunisia have said some of their citizens died because of high heat, The Associated Press reported. Saudi authorities reported more than 2,700 \"heat exhaustion\" cases on Sunday, according to AFP.\n\nDue in part to the large numbers of people who attend, the Hajj can be dangerous even under ideal climactic conditions. In 2015, more than 2,400 people died in a stampede during the \"Rami al-Jamarat,\" or stoning of the devil, ritual in Mina, near Mecca. In total, more than 9,000 people have died at mass religious gatherings in the past 119 years, and more than 5,000 of those deaths were at the Hajj. Last year, the death toll was more than 300, according to AFP.\n\nHowever, as public safety expert Milad Haghani wrote in The Conversation, \"while most Hajj fatalities have been due to crowd crushes and stampedes, a new threat has emerged: extreme climate.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia has taken steps to protect pilgrims from extreme temperatures, such as informing pilgrims about heat risks, setting up field hospitals, and installing misting systems and portable water stations.\n\n\"Yet the extreme heat proved overwhelming,\" Haghani noted, \"indicating more needs to be done.\"\n\nThere are other factors that exacerbate risk: Unregistered pilgrims, who attend unofficially to avoid paying for expensive permits, cannot enter air-conditioned areas set up for registered visitors, as AFP noted; 630 of the 658 Egyptians reported dead were unregistered, as were more than half of the overall death toll. Another factor is that many pilgrims attend the Hajj when they are older and have saved up the money to go, making them more vulnerable to heat-related complications.\n\n\"There has been a noted uptick in heat-related deaths as global warming gets worse but I have never heard of anything like what has happened over the Hajj in Saudi Arabia this year,\" journalist S\u00e9amus Malekafzali posted on social media. \"Over 1,000 people have died over the course of a week, almost all from heatstroke.\"\n\n\"There is already significant infrastructure to deal with the Gulf Arab heat around Mecca and Medina, but I don't know if there is a way to outpace the massive amounts of heat and humidity that is going to beset southwestern Saudi Arabia,\" Malekafzali continued. \"Even in December, it can get above 100\u00b0F.\"\n\nJeff Goodell, author of the book The Heat Will Kill You First, wrote on social media in response to the deaths that \"our world was built for a climate that no longer exists.\"\n\nThe situation is likely to get worse as the burning of fossil fuels continues to push global temperatures higher. The Post analysis finding that Mecca would be dangerous in the sun for more than half the year by 2050 also found it would see 54 days dangerous even in the shade.\n\n\"Let that sink in. Fossil fuels will have caused the holiest city in Islam to be virtually uninhabitable for 50% of the year,\" Climate Defiance wrote.\n\nA Saudi study published in March found that dry-bulb temperatures in Mecca had risen by 0.4\u00b0C per decade and wet-bulb (which incorporates humidity) by 2\u00b0C. A 2019 study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers concluded that, even with emissions cuts, the Hajj would take place while temperatures surpassed the \"extreme danger\" limit between 2047 and 2052 and again between 2079 and 2086.\n\n\"Climate change does not discriminate by religion, ethnicity, nationality,\" Marina Romanello, the executive director of The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change, wrote on social media. \"Hundreds died in the pilgrimage to Mecca, practicing their sacred ritual, as temperatures rise to nearly 50\u00b0C [122\u00b0F]. Unless we take urgent action, this will be just the beginning.\"\n\nClimate Defiance concluded: \"This loss of life is a tragedy and sadly it's also a harbinger of what is to come. The pilgrims who perished are there canary in the coal mine. We must mourn their deaths, but we must also ACT. It is not too late but time is running out. This is not a drill. This is a fire.\"", "source": {"uri": "therussophile.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheRussophiles"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki",

Egyptian pilgrims during this Hajj season, 1445 AH.\n\nAs per the president's directives, the crisis cell will closely monitor and manage the situation regarding the deceased pilgrims, the Egyptian Presidency said in a statement.\n\nThe Egyptian Presidency extends its deepest condolences and sympathies to the families of the victims and reaffirms the government's commitment to providing necessary support during this unfortunate event.\n\nSisi emphasized the immediate need for coordination with Saudi authorities to facilitate the repatriation of the deceased and ensure all necessary arrangements are made in this regard.\n\nScores missing, dead\n\nAround 56,000 Egyptians embarked on the Hajj pilgrimage this year, which spanned over the past week.\n\nWhile pilgrims have started returning to Egypt, a significant number of them are now reported missing, with many tragically losing their lives due to the extreme heat.\n\nTemperatures in Makkah hovered around a staggering 50 degrees Celsius, as reported by Saudi Arabia's National Center for Meteorology (NCM).\n\nAccording to an Arab diplomat who spoke to Agence France-Presse (AFP), this year's Hajj season has been marred by the deaths of at least 600 Egyptian pilgrims, primarily due to the extremely high temperatures.\n\nThis brings the total deaths among pilgrims this year to more than 900, according to an AFP tally.\n\nThe diplomat stated that Egyptian officials in the Kingdom has received 1,400 reports of missing pilgrims.\n\nOn Thursday, Cairo announced the establishment of consulate field teams to conduct visits to hospitals in Makkah and the holy sites to search for missing Egyptian pilgrims.\n\nAdditionally, a consular mission has been stationed at the East Arafat Hospital and the Muaisem medical complex around the clock, the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.\n\nUnregistered pilgrims\n\nHowever, the ministry said that unregistered Egyptian pilgrims, available in significant numbers this year, has made the mission of locating missing individuals harder.\n\nOne of the diplomats interviewed by AFP emphasized that the significant presence of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims this season has played a substantial role in the high death toll among Egyptians.\n\nThe influx of unregistered pilgrims has resulted in a breakdown of service provision.\n\nAn Egyptian official overseeing the country's Hajj mission stated, \"The presence of irregular pilgrims created immense chaos in the Egyptian pilgrims' camps, leading to a collapse in the services provided.\"\n\nHe further explained that the pilgrims were deprived of essential necessities such as food, water, and adequate shelter, which resulted in fatalities due to the extreme heat.",

More than half of those who died were unregistered pilgrims, according to the outlet. Reuters reported on Wednesday that at least 562 people have died, with 307 of the deaths coming from Egypt alone.\n\nThe Hajj is an annual pilgrimage by Muslims to Mecca, Mount Arafat and other holy sites in Saudi Arabia. Pilgrims are required to register with Saudi authorities, though some go unofficially.\n\nThis year's Hajj has taken place in extreme heat, with temperatures reportedly reaching 125 degrees Fahrenheit (52 Celsius) at Mecca's grand mosque this week. The more than 1,000 deaths is four times higher than the at least 240 who died in 2023.\n\nMany of the deaths have been linked to the heat. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that 41 citizens on the pilgrimage had died due to sunstroke.\n\nJordan's state broadcaster Al-Mamlaka reported on Wednesday that Jordanian pilgrims who were not part of the country's official delegation had to walk in the sun to reach Arafat, causing death and injury.\n\nA Kurdistan Regional Government official told the Iraqi Kurdish news outlet Rudaw on Tuesday that 15 people from the region died in relation to the heat wave during the Hajj. KRG spokesperson Karwan Stoni told AFP on Monday that heat and heart attacks were the reasons for the deaths, adding that 12 of the dead did not have official Hajj permits and therefore could not access air-conditioned areas.\n\nSaudi officials have not commented on the number of deaths, but have repeatedly urged pilgrims to follow safety precautions such as avoiding direct sun exposure, using umbrellas and staying hydrated. Saudi authorities said last Saturday that they had cleared more than 300,000 unregistered pilgrims from Mecca ahead of the Hajj, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.\n\nIran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Tuesday that 11 Iranians died during the Hajj, mostly due to heat stroke and old age.\n\nTunisia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a Tuesday statement that 35 Tunisians had died during the event. Of those who perished, 30 traveled to the kingdom on tourism or visas for the Umrah, or visits to Mecca outside of the designated Hajj period.\n\nPakistan's Ministry of Religious Affairs said on Wednesday that at least 35 Pakistanis had died during the Hajj. The ministry did not list specific causes of death, but noted the extreme heat in the area, according to reports in the country.\n\nMalaysia's Religion Minister Datuk Mohd Na'im Mokhtar said on Thursday that 14 citizens died, mostly due to heart disease, pneumonia and blood infection, Malaysian media reported.\n\nOther deaths were confirmed by the governments of India, Senegal and Sudan, according to AFP.\n\nWhy it matters: Climate change is hitting the Middle East and North Africa on a wide scale this summer. Kuwaiti authorities announced temporary power cuts on Wednesday, citing struggles to meet demand during peak hours.\n\nPeople in the region rely on power for cooling systems during the summer heat. Power supplies are relatively stable in the Gulf, but public electricity is only available for part of the day in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and other parts of the region, prompting those who can afford it to use fuel-powered generators.\n\nAlgeria has experienced protests this month over water shortages. The North African country's water supply has been diminished by intense heat and a lack of rainfall.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al-Monitor"}, "authors": [],

Saudi Arabia is heating 50% faster than the rest of the Northern Hemisphere, and by 2050, The Washington Post and Carbon Plan estimated that temperatures would rise high enough in Mecca to make it dangerous to be in the sun for 182 days a year.\n\n\"Words fail. Words fail,\" the activist group Climate Defiance wrote on social media in response to the deaths.\n\n\"Stop it with your vapid odes to incrementalism. Stop it with your 2050 pledges,\" the group added. \"Humanity is barreling to the brink. Open your eyes!\"\n\n\"For so many, religious rituals are a sacred and central part of their identities,\" the group continued. \"Now merely practicing a faith proves a literal death sentence.\"\n\nMecca is the holiest city in the Islamic religious tradition, and making the Hajj, or pilgrimage, there is one of Islam's Five Pillars. The Hajj always draws hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world, with more than 1.8 million registered pilgrims attending this year. The timing depends on the Islamic calendar, which follows a lunar cycle. In 2024, it fell between June 14 and June 19 in the Gregorian calendar, coinciding with Saudi Arabia's hotter period.\n\n\"The Hajj is considered one of the Five Pillars of Islam, along with belief in Allah, prayer, fasting, and charity. It is intended to be a sacred part of life,\" Climate Defiance wrote. \"Due to profit-driven, fossil-fueled global hearing, it is now a part of death.\"\n\nAt the close of this year's pilgrimage, a total of 1,081 people were reported dead as of Thursday, according to an Agence France-Presse tally based on official statements or diplomats' reports. The majority -- 658 -- were from Egypt, and a Saudi diplomat told AFP that the heat was the primary cause of death.\n\n\"Ambulances were moving nonstop, collecting people left and right,\" pilgrim Ahmad Bahaa, a 37-year-old Egyptian engineer who works in Saudi Arabia, told The Washington Post. \"People were sleeping on the sidewalks... I saw someone right in front of our tent who collapsed and could not even move.\"\n\nIncluding Egypt, deaths were reported from around 10 countries, according to AFP: They included 183 from Indonesia, 58 from Pakistan, as well as fatalities from Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan, and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region. Other countries including Jordan and Tunisia have said some of their citizens died because of high heat, The Associated Press reported. Saudi authorities reported more than 2,700 \"heat exhaustion\" cases on Sunday, according to AFP.\n\nDue in part to the large numbers of people who attend, the Hajj can be dangerous even under ideal climactic conditions. In 2015, more than 2,400 people died in a stampede during the \"Rami al-Jamarat,\" or stoning of the devil, ritual in Mina, near Mecca. In total, more than 9,000 people have died at mass religious gatherings in the past 119 years, and more than 5,000 of those deaths were at the Hajj. Last year, the death toll was more than 300, according to AFP.\n\nHowever, as public safety expert Milad Haghani wrote in The Conversation, \"while most Hajj fatalities have been due to crowd crushes and stampedes, a new threat has emerged: extreme climate.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia has taken steps to protect pilgrims from extreme temperatures, such as informing pilgrims about heat risks, setting up field hospitals, and installing misting systems and portable water stations.\n\n\"Yet the extreme heat proved overwhelming,\" Haghani noted, \"indicating more needs to be done.\"\n\nThere are other factors that exacerbate risk: Unregistered pilgrims, who attend unofficially to avoid paying for expensive permits, cannot enter air-conditioned areas set up for registered visitors, as AFP noted; 630 of the 658 Egyptians reported dead were unregistered, as were more than half of the overall death toll. Another factor is that many pilgrims attend the Hajj when they are older and have saved up the money to go, making them more vulnerable to heat-related complications.\n\n\"There has been a noted uptick in heat-related deaths as global warming gets worse but I have never heard of anything like what has happened over the Hajj in Saudi Arabia this year,\" journalist S\u00e9amus Malekafzali posted on social media. \"Over 1,000 people have died over the course of a week, almost all from heatstroke.\"\n\n\"There is already significant infrastructure to deal with the Gulf Arab heat around Mecca and Medina, but I don't know if there is a way to outpace the massive amounts of heat and humidity that is going to beset southwestern Saudi Arabia,\" Malekafzali continued. \"Even in December, it can get above 100\u00b0F.\"\n\nJeff Goodell, author of the book The Heat Will Kill You First, wrote on social media in response to the deaths that \"our world was built for a climate that no longer exists.\"\n\nThe situation is likely to get worse as the burning of fossil fuels continues to push global temperatures higher. The Post analysis finding that Mecca would be dangerous in the sun for more than half the year by 2050 also found it would see 54 days dangerous even in the shade.\n\n\"Let that sink in. Fossil fuels will have caused the holiest city in Islam to be virtually uninhabitable for 50% of the year,\" Climate Defiance wrote.\n\nA Saudi study published in March found that dry-bulb temperatures in Mecca had risen by 0.4\u00b0C per decade and wet-bulb (which incorporates humidity) by 2\u00b0C. A 2019 study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers concluded that, even with emissions cuts, the Hajj would take place while temperatures surpassed the \"extreme danger\" limit between 2047 and 2052 and again between 2079 and 2086.\n\n\"Climate change does not discriminate by religion, ethnicity, nationality,\" Marina Romanello, the executive director of The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change, wrote on social media. \"Hundreds died in the pilgrimage to Mecca, practicing their sacred ritual, as temperatures rise to nearly 50\u00b0C [122\u00b0F]. Unless we take urgent action, this will be just the beginning.\"\n\nClimate Defiance concluded: \"This loss of life is a tragedy and sadly it's also a harbinger of what is to come. The pilgrims who perished are there canary in the coal mine. We must mourn their deaths, but we must also ACT. It is not too late but time is running out. This is not a drill. This is a fire.\"", "source": {"uri": "truthout.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthout"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olivia_rosane@truthout.org", "name": "Olivia Rosane", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Saudi Arabia is heating 50% faster than the rest of the Northern Hemisphere, and by 2050, The Washington Post and Carbon Plan estimated that temperatures would rise high enough in Mecca to make it dangerous to be in the sun for 182 days a year.\n\n\"Words fail. Words fail,\" the activist group Climate Defiance wrote on social media in response to the deaths.\n\n\"Stop it with your vapid odes to incrementalism. Stop it with your 2050 pledges,\" the group added. \"Humanity is barreling to the brink. Open your eyes!\"\n\n\"For so many, religious rituals are a sacred and central part of their identities,\" the group continued. \"Now merely practicing a faith proves a literal death sentence.\"\n\n\"There has been a noted uptick in heat-related deaths as global warming gets worse but I have never heard of anything like what has happened over the Hajj in Saudi Arabia this year.\"\n\nMecca is the holiest city in the Islamic religious tradition, and making the Hajj, or pilgrimage, there is one of Islam's Five Pillars. The Hajj always draws hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world, with more than 1.8 million registered pilgrims attending this year. The timing depends on the Islamic calendar, which follows a lunar cycle. In 2024, it fell between June 14 and June 19 in the Gregorian calendar, coinciding with Saudi Arabia's hotter period.\n\n\"The Hajj is considered one of the Five Pillars of Islam, along with belief in Allah, prayer, fasting, and charity. It is intended to be a sacred part of life,\" Climate Defiance wrote. \"Due to profit-driven, fossil-fueled global hearing, it is now a part of death.\"\n\nAt the close of this year's pilgrimage, a total of 1,081 people were reported dead as of Thursday, according to an Agence France-Presse tally based on official statements or diplomats' reports. The majority -- 658 -- were from Egypt, and a Saudi diplomat told AFP that the heat was the primary cause of death.\n\n\"Ambulances were moving nonstop, collecting people left and right,\" pilgrim Ahmad Bahaa, a 37-year-old Egyptian engineer who works in Saudi Arabia, toldThe Washington Post. \"People were sleeping on the sidewalks... I saw someone right in front of our tent who collapsed and could not even move.\"\n\nIncluding Egypt, deaths were reported from around 10 countries, according to AFP: They included 183 from Indonesia, 58 from Pakistan, as well as fatalities from Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan, and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region. Other countries including Jordan and Tunisia have said some of their citizens died because of high heat, The Associated Press reported. Saudi authorities reported more than 2,700 \"heat exhaustion\" cases on Sunday, according to AFP.\n\nDue in part to the large numbers of people who attend, the Hajj can be dangerous even under ideal climactic conditions. In 2015, more than 2,400 people died in a stampede during the \"Rami al-Jamarat,\" or stoning of the devil, ritual in Mina, near Mecca. In total, more than 9,000 people have died at mass religious gatherings in the past 119 years, and more than 5,000 of those deaths were at the Hajj. Last year, the death toll was more than 300, according to AFP.\n\nHowever, as public safety expert Milad Haghani wrote in The Conversation, \"while most Hajj fatalities have been due to crowd crushes and stampedes, a new threat has emerged: extreme climate.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia has taken steps to protect pilgrims from extreme temperatures, such as informing pilgrims about heat risks, setting up field hospitals, and installing misting systems and portable water stations.\n\n\"Yet the extreme heat proved overwhelming,\" Haghani noted, \"indicating more needs to be done.\"\n\nThere are other factors that exacerbate risk: Unregistered pilgrims, who attend unofficially to avoid paying for expensive permits, cannot enter air-conditioned areas set up for registered visitors, as AFP noted; 630 of the 658 Egyptians reported dead were unregistered, as were more than half of the overall death toll. Another factor is that many pilgrims attend the Hajj when they are older and have saved up the money to go, making them more vulnerable to heat-related complications.\n\n\"There has been a noted uptick in heat-related deaths as global warming gets worse but I have never heard of anything like what has happened over the Hajj in Saudi Arabia this year,\" journalist S\u00e9amus Malekafzali posted on social media. \"Over 1,000 people have died over the course of a week, almost all from heatstroke.\"\n\n\"There is already significant infrastructure to deal with the Gulf Arab heat around Mecca and Medina, but I don't know if there is a way to outpace the massive amounts of heat and humidity that is going to beset southwestern Saudi Arabia,\" Malekafzali continued. \"Even in December, it can get above 100\u00b0F.\"\n\nJeff Goodell, author of the book The Heat Will Kill You First, wrote on social media in response to the deaths that \"our world was built for a climate that no longer exists.\"\n\nThe situation is likely to get worse as the burning of fossil fuels continues to push global temperatures higher. The Post analysis finding that Mecca would be dangerous in the sun for more than half the year by 2050 also found it would see 54 days dangerous even in the shade.\n\n\"Let that sink in. Fossil fuels will have caused the holiest city in Islam to be virtually uninhabitable for 50% of the year,\" Climate Defiance wrote.\n\nA Saudi study published in March found that dry-bulb temperatures in Mecca had risen by 0.4\u00b0C per decade and wet-bulb (which incorporates humidity) by 2\u00b0C. A 2019 study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers concluded that, even with emissions cuts, the Hajj would take place while temperatures surpassed the \"extreme danger\" limit between 2047 and 2052 and again between 2079 and 2086.\n\n\"Climate change does not discriminate by religion, ethnicity, nationality,\" Marina Romanello, the executive director of TheLancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change, wrote on social media. \"Hundreds died in the pilgrimage to Mecca, practicing their sacred ritual, as temperatures rise to nearly 50\u00b0C [122\u00b0F]. Unless we take urgent action, this will be just the beginning.\"\n\nClimate Defiance concluded: \"This loss of life is a tragedy and sadly it's also a harbinger of what is to come. The pilgrims who perished are there canary in the coal mine. We must mourn their deaths, but we must also ACT. It is not too late but time is running out. This is not a drill.

Meanwhile, hundreds of people have taken to social media to post about their loved ones being unaccounted for.\n\nMore than 1.8 million people are taking part in this year's Hajj, one of the world's largest religious gatherings, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics.\n\nWhile deaths among pilgrims are not uncommon (there were more than 200 last year), this year's gathering is being held amid particularly high temperatures.\n\nHajj season changes every year according to the Islamic calendar and this year it fell in June, one of the hottest months in the kingdom.\n\nOn Monday, Saudi Arabia advised pilgrims against performing the \"stoning of the devil\" ritual between certain hours after temperatures reached an extreme 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nHajj officials have asked pilgrims to carry umbrellas and stay hydrated amid the harsh conditions while the Saudi army has deployed more than 1,600 personnel with medical units specifically for heatstroke and 30 rapid response teams. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers are taking part.\n\nPerforming Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his or her life.\n\nThe pilgrimage includes numerous detailed rituals including wearing a special garment that symbolizes human equality and unity before God, a circular, counter-clockwise procession around the cube-shaped Kaaba building, and the symbolic stoning of evil.\n\nThe Hajj is a source of prestige for Saudi Arabia's king, who holds the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques as the guardian of Islam's holiest sites. But the pilgrimage is also a significant source of revenue for the Saudi economy.\n\nSoon after King Salman bin Abdulaziz took power in 2015, Saudi Arabia launched a $21 billion project to expand the Grand Mosque in Mecca to accommodate 300,000 additional worshippers. A year later, then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman identified the pilgrimage as a key component of a plan to diversify the Saudi economy by 2030.\n\nExperts say that with oil sales generating close to a billion dollars a day for the kingdom, the pilgrimage's economic benefit is marginal by comparison. But its great, untapped potential could bring significant riches to the kingdom in the long term.\n\nPilgrimage revenues were forecast to average about $30 billion a year and create 100,000 jobs for Saudis when the kingdom attracted around 21 million worshippers annually during the 10-day Hajj as well as the yearlong Umrah pilgrimage, according to official data cited by Reuters. The government is targeting 30 million pilgrims by 2030.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.

Climate change has helped propel the temperature upward and could do so dramatically over the next several decades, per CBS.\n\nThis year, temperatures at the Grand Mosque in Mecca reached 51.8 degrees Celsius, or 125 degrees Fahrenheit, the article said.\n\nConfusion in the aftermath\n\nIn the wake of this year's Hajj, friends and family of missing pilgrims are frantically searching for them. The authorities read out the names of the dead to crowds of distressed travelers, according to The Associated Press. Next of kin were permitted to see bodies in order to identify them.\n\nAn Egyptian man who heard the name of his mother started shouting over the phone at his travel agent, the article noted. \"He left her to die,\" he said about the agent while onlookers tried to assist him.\n\nOthers are taking to social media with requests for information, per France 24.\n\n\"I received a call from (a woman in Egypt) begging me to put any post on Facebook that can help track (her mother) or find her,\" said a Saudi Arabian man. \"The good news is that until now we did not find her on the list of the dead people, which gives us hope she is still alive.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrimage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pilgrimage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_climate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desert climate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mosque_of_Mecca", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Mosque of Mecca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_24", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France 24"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/deseret_news_992/568d6a3d34895062f13dc9283b1be511", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663052", "eventUri": "eng-9663052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Those who have perished come from more than two dozen countries, with most fatalities from Egypt. The BBC visited one community there which has lost more than 20 people.\n\nMany Egyptian pilgrims come from poor villages. They spend their life savings on the spiritual journey to the holiest city in Islam.\n\nEffendiya, a 70-year-old mother of five from the northern province of Menoufiya, sold her jewellery to pay for her trip, her youngest son Sayyed tells me, but died while performing her rituals.\n\n\"My mum's death has broken me,\" he says, bursting into tears. He explains that going to Hajj was his mother's biggest dream.\n\nEffendiya, a widow, went to Mecca on a tourist visa, not on an official Hajj visa.\n\nShe was among hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims who hoped to fulfil their religious obligation this year without obtaining special Hajj permits.\n\nSaudi authorities considered these unofficial visits a violation of their regulations. But the process of obtaining official Hajj permits can sometimes become costly or complicated.\n\nGetting on an official Hajj convoy in Egypt - a country in a deep economic crisis - can cost around $6,000 (\u00a34,700) per person.\n\nEffendiya's trip was organised by a local broker, who charged her half this amount but promised her five-star service, her family say.\n\nThe reality was totally different, they say.\n\nOn Arafat Day, this year falling on 15 June, pilgrims spend from sunrise to sunset congregating on Mount Arafat - around 20km [12 miles] from Mecca - for prayers and sermons.\n\n\"The bus dropped them around 12km away from Mount Arafat and left. She had to walk all the way on foot,\" says Tariq, Effendiya's eldest son.\n\n\"Whenever I video called her she was pouring water on her head. She couldn't take the baking heat.\n\n\"In our last call she looked exhausted.\"\n\nPilgrims usually stay in air-conditioned tents, have buses to drive them between holy sites and are provided with medical care.\n\nSayyed says Effendiya and other unregistered pilgrims \"had none of these facilities, they were totally abandoned\". He adds that they tried to protect themselves from the searing heat by using bedsheets to make a tent.\n\nHer family say they have been unable to contact the broker who organised her trip.\n\nHajj is one of the main pillars of Islam. Muslims are required to take part in it once in their life - if financially and physically capable - and believe they come back from the pilgrimage cleansed of their sins.\n\nIt's one of the largest annual religious gatherings in the world. Nearly two million pilgrims have travelled to Mecca this year.\n\nBut none will have set out expecting their journey to end with their demise.\n\nThe Egyptian authorities say many of the deceased pilgrims are not registered, making determining an official death toll difficult. The foreign ministry has said it will take more time and effort to identify the dead and contact their families.\n\nEgyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly has said an investigation will be opened into the activities of all tour companies, involved in sending unregistered pilgrim to Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"Without my mum, I feel scared,\" says Manal, Effendiya's eldest daughter, eyes full of grief.\n\nShe recalls that she started screaming the moment she received the news of her mother's death.\n\n\"Shortly before she died, she called my brother and told him that she felt her soul was leaving her body. I just wished I could have been with her then,\" Manal tells me, tears rolling down her cheeks.\n\nEffendiya died while lying down to catch her breath in the shade on a street corner.\n\nHer heartbroken children take some solace in the fact that she was buried in Mecca.\n\n\"She was hoping to die and be buried in the holy city,\" Manal says.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Arafat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mount Arafat"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sayyid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Arafah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Day of Arafah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sermon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrim", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pilgrim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostafa_Madbouly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mostafa Madbouly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_city", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holy city"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Egypt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Egypt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Pillars_of_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Five Pillars of Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 9}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/58519102e9ec5ef0ae692d43687ff319", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663052", "eventUri": "eng-9663052", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 1510, "textEnd": 1517}], "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

It was later revealed that Ghanaians were also among the victims of the heat wave.\n\nMore than 1,000 people have now died during the Hajj pilgrimage to the city of Mecca, according to Sky News.\n\n\"The temperature was so high -- above 41 degrees Celsius. They asked the authorities to confine us to our camps between noon and 4 p.m. Saudi time. Later, we heard that some Georgians lost their lives in town. At the time, we didn't even know that some Ghanaians were also going to lose their lives under the conditions said to be related to the heat waves that swept across Saudi Arabia on the day.\n\n\"I had the opportunity to speak with an official at the time word spread around the Ghanaian camp that 13 of our nationals had lost their lives. These people were persons who did not travel via the Hajj Board.

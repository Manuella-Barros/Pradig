According to a report in Financial Times, quoting an SEC filing, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has slashed its stake in iPhone maker Apple in half as part of a selling spree in which the billionaire investor sold $76 billion of stocks.\n\nWarren Buffet-led investment company slashed its Apple position by more than $50 billion to $84.2 billion in the second quarter, according to filings released on Saturday, August 3. The move generated a substantial $47.2bn after-tax profit, according to FT calculations.\n\nApple remains Berkshire's biggest holding\n\nBerkshire Hathaway reported that its Apple bet was worth $135.4 billion, implying around 790 million shares. This marks a decline of around 13% in the stake. Apple was still Berkshire's biggest holding by far at the end of the quarter. Buffett is said to be a big fan of Apple, and has called the company his favourite bet in the past.\n\nWhy Berkshire Hathway sold Apple shares\n\nThe reason for Berkshire Hathway cutting its stake is not known. Some speculations suggest it is for tax purposes. According to a report in CNBC, Buffett, while answering shareholder questions at Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, suggested that the sale was for tax reasons following sizable gains. He also implied the sale could be tied to him wanting to avoid a higher tax bill down the road if rates go higher to fund a ballooning U.S. fiscal deficit.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha began trimming Berkshire's Apple stake late last year, accelerating the process earlier this year. However, he maintained in May that the tech giant remained a core long-term investment alongside Coca-Cola and American Express.\n\nThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

August. 05, 2024 08:15. by Ji-Sun Choi aurinko@donga.com.\n\nAmerican holding company Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett (pictured), sold nearly half of its Apple stocks in the first half of 2024 alone. The company's cash holdings reached a record high of 276.9 billion dollars.\n\nAccording to publicly disclosed information and second quarter performance report released by Berkshire Hathaway on Aug 3(local time), the value of Berkshire Hathaway's Apple shares as of the end of June was 84.2 billion U.S. dollars, down by half from 174.3 billion dollars as of the end of last year. The Financial Times reported that the company appears to have sold about 390 million shares, or about half of the Apple shares it held. Berkshire Hathaway previously announced in its first quarter disclosure that it sold approximately 115 million shares of Apple. It continued to maintain its strategy in the second quarter.\n\nThe market is paying attention to Buffet's selling of Apple shares as Buffet is known for value investing. Buffet said at the annual general shareholders' meeting in May that the sale of Apple stock in the first quarter was \"for tax saving purposes.\" The Financial Times reported that this explanation lacked rationale as selling continued in the second quarter. Berkshire Hathaway also reduced its share of Bank of America stocks, which accounted for the second largest share in its investment portfolio after Apple, by about 8.8% during the first half of the year.\n\nWith the recent sale, Berkshire Hathaway's cash reserves reached a record high of 276.9 billion dollars. The Financial Times reported that this was because Berkshire Hathaway could not find a suitable investment source and reported that the company was actively investing in short-term government bonds. \"We won't spend it unless we think they're doing something that has minimal risk and can make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said in May.", "source": {"uri": "donga.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.donga.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holding company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Value investing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://dimg1.donga.com/ugc/CDB/ENGLISH/Article/66/b0/0b/7e/66b00b7e0957d273823e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790194", "eventUri": "eng-9790194", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 452, "textEnd": 457}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-08-", "textStart": 51, "textEnd": 61}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

This sale involved approximately 400 million shares, which occurred before the post-Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) stock peak.\n\nAs of December 2023, Berkshire Hathaway held roughly $174.3 billion in Apple stock. However, according to a recent report, the company's holdings have decreased to about $84.2 billion, excluding any additional sales in the past month. The highest price at which the shares could have been sold was $192.35 on May 21. Interestingly, Apple stock reached its highest price of the year at $234.82 on July 16, just weeks after the quarter ended. On the Friday following Apple's earnings report, which exceeded Wall Street's expectations, the stock closed at $219.86.\n\nFollowing the sale, Berkshire Hathaway now owns around 2.6 per cent of Apple, a stake valued at approximately $88 billion. This latest sale is part of a series of stake reductions. In the first quarter of 2024, the firm sold about 12.5 per cent of its Apple holdings, and it also ended 2023 with a sale of Apple stock. Despite these moves, Apple remains Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding in terms of value.\n\nThis isn't the first time Berkshire Hathaway has trimmed its Apple stake. Similar percentages of Apple shares were sold in 2020 and 2021. Reflecting on those sales, Warren Buffett later acknowledged that reducing their Apple holdings was \"probably a mistake.\"\n\nThe timing of the recent sale, missing out on the post-WWDC stock peak, raises questions about the strategic considerations behind the move. While the exact motivations are not publicly detailed, the sale could reflect a broader strategy to diversify Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio or to capitalize on favourable market conditions at the time of sale.\n\nWhile Berkshire Hathaway has significantly reduced its Apple holdings, the company still retains a substantial stake in the tech giant.

But many on Wall Street are urging investors to look past the news and stay calm.\n\nThe Warren Buffett-led conglomerate revealed Saturday that it sold almost half of its position in the tech giant during the second quarter. Its stake now stands at roughly $84 billion, down from about $140 billion at the end of March. The selling took place during a torrid run in the stock market that sent Apple shares 23 per cent higher and pushed the S&P 500 from one record to the next.\n\nSince 2016, when Warren Buffett first disclosed its stake in Apple, its shares have soared almost 900 per cent as the company cemented its grip on the industry, delivering Berkshire billions of dollars worth of unrealized profits along the way.\n\n\"Buffett's reduction of his Apple stake is merely about risk management,\" said Joe Gilbert, senior portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management. \"If there were any concerns about the longer-term viability of Apple, Buffett would have exited the entire position. Similar to Berkshire's other stock position reductions, Buffett has meaningful unrealized gains.\"\n\nBerkshire's portfolio reveal comes just days after Apple released its own quarterly results, which showed a return to revenue growth and signaled that new AI features will boost iPhone sales in the coming quarters. Apple shares were steady after the earnings report and ultimately ended the week higher despite the broader selloff.\n\nWhile the investment strategy of Buffett -- long known as the Oracle of Omaha -- is hard to ignore, Berkshire's stake in Apple had gotten so large in recent years that some investors had begun to wonder whether the firm would have to trim its position to balance out its holdings. Even after the unwind, Apple remains Berkshire's largest single position.\n\n\"If you've got this outsized position you take some profits and you reduce some of your concentration risk,\" said Cathy Seifert, a research analyst at CFRA. \"They still have a fairly concentrated portfolio,\" she added.\n\nIt's also not the first time Berkshire has cut its stake in Apple. At its annual meeting in May, the firm revealed that it had reduced its position during the first quarter of the year. At the time, Buffett hinted to investors that tax implications may have played a role in the sale.\n\nRepresentatives for Apple and Berkshire Hathaway didn't respond to requests for comment outside of regular business hours on Sunday.\n\nThe latest announcement comes amid broader concern about the potential of an economic downturn ahead. Worse-than-expected jobs data on Friday stoked fears the Federal Reserve may have waited too long to start reducing interest rates, sending the Nasdaq 100 Index into a technical correction and the Cboe Volatility Index toward 25.\n\nMegacap peers including Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. have all tumbled from record highs reached in early July. In total, Nasdaq 100 members have shed more than $3 trillion in value over that stretch with both Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. each seeing declines of more than 20 per cent. Apple, meanwhile, is down about 6 per cent from its all-time high.\n\nIt's possible that Berkshire, like an increasing number of investors, wants to see more proof that Apple's AI investments will pay off with revenue growth and isn't convinced that's happening fast enough, according to Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.\n\nApple's valuation multiple -- at 33 times future profits as of mid-July -- was 11 points higher than that of the broader S&P 500, a gap that was last seen in the aftermath of the pandemic and the financial crisis, data compiled by Bloomberg show. But despite the valuation premium, Mulberry thinks it still makes sense for investors to own Apple shares. \"They're still in a healthy balance sheet position and they're still going to grow earnings faster than the broader market,\" he said.\n\nOthers, including Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, point to Apple's brand loyalty and future growth - it's on the cusp of what he thinks is a major upgrade cycle that will drive revenue growth in 2025 and 2026.\n\n\"While some could read this as confidence worry, Apple just delivered a robust quarter with a massive AI driven super cycle ahead and we do not view this as the time to hit the exit button,\" Ives said.\n\nOf course, Apple isn't the only stake that Berkshire has trimmed lately -- it's been unloading shares of Bank of America Corp., cutting its position by 8.8% since mid-July. Some see that as a sign that Buffett doesn't see any individual problems with either company, but is instead betting that the US consumer and broader economy are set to weaken.\n\n\"Buffett may feel we're about to go into a recession, so by raising cash now he will be able to buy companies cheap later on,\" said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors. . \"He may smell an opportunity coming.\"", "source": {"uri": "businesspost.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway",

second quarter of 2024, comes on top of the 115 million shares the company sold between January and March and represents a total 55.8% reduction in Berkshire's Apple holdings since the beginning of the year.\n\nAs at June 30, Berkshire still owned 400 million Apple shares valued at an estimated $129.5 billion.\n\nThe move has sent shockwaves through the financial community, with many wondering

happened on the back of limited positive financial news.\n\nOthers suggest it shows a lack of confidence in share markets by the world's most-followed investor.\n\n\"This is a company girding itself for a weaker economic climate -- Mr Buffett may be preparing for a downturn,\" one analyst said.\n\n\"Apple's tepid growth rate and high valuation suggest the famed investor may have concluded the stock's prospects are not great,\" said another.\n\nMr Buffett has assured markets that Apple would remain Berkshire's largest stock investment but said selling made sense because the 21% US federal tax rate on capital gains was likely to grow.\n\n\"Unless something really extraordinary happens, we will own Apple and American Express and Coca-Cola when [my successor] takes over this place,\" Mr Buffett said.\n\nAlthough Apple shares have gained 18.4% this year to reach a market capitalisation of $6.77 trillion, nervy investors are expected to follow Berkshire Hathaway out of the stock.\n\nThe proceeds saw Berkshire's cash float surge to a record $425b by end June, up from the previous all-time high of $290b at end March.\n\nBerkshire reports show that its American Express stake was worth approximately $53b last quarter, while its Coca-Cola stake was worth nearly $38b.\n\nChevron and Bank of America are also in the firm's top five holdings, valued at $29.84b and $60.3b

This move comes as Berkshire posted a record quarterly operating profit but also reflects Buffett's cautious stance on the U.S. economy and stock market valuations. Analysts suggest that Berkshire is adopting a defensive strategy in response to current market conditions.\n\nThe conglomerate's decision to cut its Apple holdings and boost cash reserves highlights Buffett's concern about finding attractive investment opportunities. Berkshire's (BRK.B) cash stake rose to $276.9 billion as of June 30, from $189 billion three months earlier. Despite the reduction, Apple remains Berkshire's largest stock investment, with 400 million shares valued at $84.2 billion.\n\nMarket Overview:\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.", "source": {"uri": "nasdaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NASDAQ Stock Market"}, "authors": [{"uri": "quiver_quantitative@nasdaq.com", "name": "Quiver Quantitative", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq, Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash_Registers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash Registers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790194", "eventUri": "eng-9790194", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 674, "textEnd": 681}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

But many on Wall Street are urging investors to look past the news and stay calm.\n\nThe Warren Buffett-led conglomerate revealed Saturday that it sold almost half of its position in the tech giant during the second quarter. Its stake now stands at roughly $84 billion, down from about $140 billion at the end of March. The selling took place during a torrid run in the stock market that sent Apple shares 23% higher and pushed the S&P 500 from one record to the next.\n\nSince 2016, when Warren Buffett first disclosed its stake in Apple, its shares have soared almost 900% as the company cemented its grip on the industry, delivering Berkshire billions of dollars worth of unrealized profits along the way.\n\nAlso read: iPhone 16 Pro may beat iPhone 16 Pro Max in battery capacity jump, here's what we know so far\n\n\"Buffett's reduction of his Apple stake is merely about risk management,\" said Joe Gilbert, senior portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management. \"If there were any concerns about the longer-term viability of Apple, Buffett would have exited the entire position. Similar to Berkshire's other stock position reductions, Buffett has meaningful unrealized gains.\"\n\nBerkshire's portfolio reveal comes just days after Apple released its own quarterly results, which showed a return to revenue growth and signaled that new AI features will boost iPhone sales in the coming quarters. Apple shares were steady after the earnings report and ultimately ended the week higher despite the broader selloff.\n\nAlso read: iPhone users to get these 5 transformative Apple Intelligence features with iOS 18\n\nWhile the investment strategy of Buffett -- long known as the Oracle of Omaha -- is hard to ignore, Berkshire's stake in Apple had gotten so large in recent years that some investors had begun to wonder whether the firm would have to trim its position to balance out its holdings. Even after the unwind, Apple remains Berkshire's largest single position.\n\n\"If you've got this outsized position you take some profits and you reduce some of your concentration risk,\" said Cathy Seifert, a research analyst at CFRA. \"They still have a fairly concentrated portfolio,\" she added.\n\nIt's also not the first time Berkshire has cut its stake in Apple. At its annual meeting in May, the firm revealed that it had reduced its position during the first quarter of the year. At the time, Buffett hinted to investors that tax implications may have played a role in the sale.\n\nAlso read: Colourful Apple Watch made using plastic, designed for kids, could be in the works - What we know\n\nRepresentatives for Apple and Berkshire Hathaway didn't respond to requests for comment outside of regular business hours on Sunday.\n\nThe latest announcement comes amid broader concern about the potential of an economic downturn ahead. Worse-than-expected jobs data on Friday stoked fears the Federal Reserve may have waited too long to start reducing interest rates, sending the Nasdaq 100 Index into a technical correction and the Cboe Volatility Index toward 25.\n\nMegacap peers including Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. have all tumbled from record highs reached in early July. In total, Nasdaq 100 members have shed more than $3 trillion in value over that stretch with both Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. each seeing declines of more than 20%. Apple, meanwhile, is down about 6% from its all-time high.\n\nIt's possible that Berkshire, like an increasing number of investors, wants to see more proof that Apple's AI investments will pay off with revenue growth and isn't convinced that's happening fast enough, according to Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.\n\nApple's valuation multiple -- at 33 times future profits as of mid-July -- was 11 points higher than that of the broader S&P 500, a gap that was last seen in the aftermath of the pandemic and the financial crisis, data compiled by Bloomberg show. But despite the valuation premium, Mulberry thinks it still makes sense for investors to own Apple shares. \"They're still in a healthy balance sheet position and they're still going to grow earnings faster than the broader market,\" he said.\n\nOthers, including Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, point to Apple's brand loyalty and future growth - it's on the cusp of what he thinks is a major upgrade cycle that will drive revenue growth in 2025 and 2026.\n\n\"While some could read this as confidence worry, Apple just delivered a robust quarter with a massive AI driven super cycle ahead and we do not view this as the time to hit the exit button,\" Ives said.\n\nOf course, Apple isn't the only stake that Berkshire has trimmed lately -- it's been unloading shares of Bank of America Corp., cutting its position by 8.8% since mid-July. Some see that as a sign that Buffett doesn't see any individual problems with either company, but is instead betting that the US consumer and broader economy are set to weaken.\n\n\"Buffett may feel we're about to go into a recession, so by raising cash now he will be able to buy companies cheap later on,\" said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors. . \"He may smell an opportunity coming.\"\n\nOne more thing!

Cash is King", "body": "\"You could conclude this is another sell signal. This was a far higher level of selling activity than we were expecting\": Edward Jones Investments.\n\nQ2 was the seventh quarter in a row during which Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's investment vehicle, shed stocks on net, this time a net of $76 billion in stocks. The proceeds went into T-bills, which grew by an additional $81 billion, a blistering pace for a three-month period - to get out of Dodge? The stock market turned south in mid-July\n\nDuring Q2 through June 30, Berkshire Hathaway piled on an additional $81 billion in T-bills, according to Berkshire's Q2 earnings release on Saturday. Its T-bill holdings:\n\nIf Berkshire earned an average of 5.3% on its T-bills in Q2, that would be about $3 billion in interest income with zero risk, accounting for roughly 8% of its pre-tax net income of $38 billion.\n\nTotal cash - so T-bills, cash, and cash equivalent - jumped by $88 billion during Q2, to $277 billion, up from $189 billion in Q1 2024, having now more than doubled since Q1 2023 ($130 billion).\n\nBuffett had said at the shareholder meeting in May that it was \"a fair assumption\" that Berkshire's total cash and T-bill pile would exceed $200 billion by the end of Q2, and that he was \"quite satisfied\" with that position. And that has come to pass by a wide margin - with cash and T-bills having ballooned to $277 billion. Cash is king.\n\nClearly, Buffett took risk off the table and locked in profits, and collected 5%-plus interest on his ballooning cash.\n\nBerkshire dumped on a net basis $75 billion of stocks in Q2.\n\nApple holdings took a massive hit. Berkshire dumped nearly half (roughly 390 million shares) of its remaining Apple shares in Q2 after having dumped 13% (116 million shares) in Q1, and about 1% (10 million shares) in Q4. Berkshire's Apple holdings are now down to about 400 million shares, from 908 million shares that it had held two years ago.\n\nThis Apple trade has been huge and hugely profitable for Berkshire. It first disclosed purchasing Apple in 2016 when the shares were in the $26-range, give or take. On Friday, Apple closed at $219.86 a share.\n\nThe super-hyped event that Buffett was buying Apple in large amounts and kept buying Apple, and kept praising Apple, was in part responsible for driving up the price of Apple shares not only through the actual buying pressure from Berkshire, but also through the media hype that came with it.\n\nDitching Bank of America. In July through August 1, reported in separate filings and not included in the Q2 quarterly report, Berkshire also sold 8.8% (or about $3.8 billion) of its Bank of America holdings in a series of transactions.\n\n\"You could conclude this is another sell signal,\" Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones who covers Berkshire, told Reuters. \"This was a far higher level of selling activity than we were expecting.\"\n\nIn terms of Berkshire's overall stock holdings at the end of Q2, about 72% were concentrated in five stocks:\n\nBerkshire repurchased just $345 million of its own shares in Q2, compared to share buybacks of $2.57 billion in Q1. Perhaps Buffett doesn't deem the shares a good deal anymore, after they soared by 44% since the beginning of 2023.\n\nEarnings from the companies that Berkshire owns (operating income) rose by 15% year-over-year to $11.6 billion, even as revenue inched up only 1% to $93.6 billion. Almost half of that profit came from its insurance empire, including GEICO, whose massive increases in premiums - what consumers have been complaining about for two years - and now reduced claims caused underwriting profits to more than triple!\n\nBut investment income, which is always volatile, fell by 28% in Q2 to $18.7 billion (from $25.9 billion a year ago). So net income fell by 15% year-over-year to $30.3 billion.\n\nEnjoy reading WOLF STREET and want to support it? You can donate. I appreciate it immensely.

The iPhone maker was the first company in history to reach a $1 trillion market cap back in 2018. Today, there are six investable companies with a market cap of $1 trillion or more.\n\nTwo more companies are knocking on the door of the $1 trillion club, though, and Apple may be a big reason why they join the group in the near future. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) and chip-manufacturing giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), better known as TSMC, could each get a boost from Apple that pushes them over the milestone.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway holds an equity portfolio worth about $300 billion. Of that, about 29%, $88 billion, is invested in Apple. That's despite some significant sales from the Oracle of Omaha over the past three quarters, including about half Berkshire's stake in the second quarter.\n\nApple remains a favorite investment of Buffett's. Despite the share sales, he fully intends for Apple to remain the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio for the foreseeable future. In 2023, he called Apple \"a better business than any we own,\" referencing the portfolio of wholly owned companies that fall under the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate.\n\nAs long as Berkshire's stake in Apple remains unchanged (far from guaranteed), even a relatively small increase in Apple's share value can add billions to Berkshire's market cap. The conglomerate already has a market cap approaching $950 billion. A strong performance from Apple stock in the second half of the year could be the thing that pushes it to $1 trillion.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway stock currently sports a price-to-book ratio of 1.6 and a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 19.4. Both are fair prices to pay for a conglomerate that is full of businesses with better-than-average growth prospects. With Buffett's consistent share repurchases, massive equity, and Treasury holdings, the prices look even more attractive.\n\nA key supplier for Apple\n\nApple has moved toward designing more and more of the silicon chips in its devices since the release of the iPhone in 2007. Not only is it designing more content for the iPhone itself, but it's expanded its in-house designs to all of its growing portfolio of devices, including Macs. And the company manufacturing those chips for Apple, TSMC, is a prime beneficiary of Apple's push to design more of its own silicon.\n\nTSMC could get an additional boost this fall. Apple unveiled Apple AI at its Worldwide Developers Conference in early June. Many Apple fans and analysts are excited about the new AI features, but there are some important details to know.\n\nFirst, Apple AI is only available on the most recent iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. It'll also be available on the forthcoming lineup of iPhone 16s. That could spur a strong upgrade cycle relative to years past. Strong iPhone sales mean strong sales for TSMC. Despite recent growth stemming from its AI chip production, smartphone chips still accounted for one-third of its revenue in Q2 when smartphone sales are typically slower. A surge in demand for smartphone chips heading into the end of the year from Apple could push revenue much higher for the company.\n\nSecond, some Apple AI features rely on securely transmitting data to Apple servers to process AI prompts and queries. Apple is using its own silicon on these servers as well. While Apple's needs may be modest at the launch, they have the potential to scale quickly, especially if Apple opens the protocol to third-party developers. That could push its demand for TSMC chips even higher.\n\nIf TSMC gets a big sales bump from a successful iPhone 16 and Apple AI launch, it could push the company to a $1 trillion market cap. The stock currently touts a market cap of around $850 billion, but it recently flirted with a trillion-dollar market cap. The current pullback looks like a great buying opportunity for the stock.\n\nShould investors just buy Apple stock?\n\nWhile both of the above companies have significant ties to Apple, investors may be wondering if it makes more sense just to buy Apple shares directly. To be sure, Apple stock looks attractive at its current price despite a forward PE of 29.5 times. The stock arguably merits a premium thanks to its strong cash position and free cash flow generation, which management uses to repurchase shares. That provides a nice boost to earnings per share over time.\n\nBut Berkshire Hathaway provides investors access to Warren Buffett's entire portfolio of diverse businesses, including those wholly owned by the conglomerate. Meanwhile, TSMC is one of the smartest ways to invest in the growing demand for AI chips, as it's the largest chip manufacturer in the world, producing the most cutting-edge chip designs.\n\nAll three fit a certain need for investors, and there's nothing saying you can't buy all of them.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $657,306!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

But many on Wall Street are urging investors to look past the news and stay calm.\n\nThe Warren Buffett-led conglomerate revealed on Aug 3 that it sold almost half of its position in the tech giant during the second quarter. Its stake now stands at roughly US$84 billion (S$111 billion), down from about US$140 billion at the end of March. The selling took place during a torrid run in the stock market that sent Apple shares 23 per cent higher and pushed the S&P 500 from one record to the next.\n\nSince 2016, when Warren Buffett first disclosed its stake in Apple, its shares have soared almost 900 per cent as the company cemented its grip on the industry, delivering Berkshire billions of dollars worth of unrealised profits along the way.\n\n\"Buffett's reduction of his Apple stake is merely about risk management,\" said Joe Gilbert, senior portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management. \"If there were any concerns about the longer-term viability of Apple, Buffett would have exited the entire position. Similar to Berkshire's other stock position reductions, Buffett has meaningful unrealised gains.\"\n\nBerkshire's portfolio reveal comes just days after Apple released its own quarterly results, which showed a return to revenue growth and signalled that new AI features will boost iPhone sales in the coming quarters. Apple shares were steady after the earnings report and ultimately ended the week higher despite the broader sell-off.\n\nWhile the investment strategy of Buffett - long known as the Oracle of Omaha - is hard to ignore, Berkshire's stake in Apple had gotten so large in recent years that some investors had begun to wonder whether the firm would have to trim its position to balance out its holdings. Even after the unwind, Apple remains Berkshire's largest single position.\n\n\"If you've got this outsized position you take some profits and you reduce some of your concentration risk,\" said Cathy Seifert, a research analyst at CFRA. \"They still have a fairly concentrated portfolio,\" she added.\n\nIt's also not the first time Berkshire has cut its stake in Apple. At its annual meeting in May, the firm revealed that it had reduced its position during the first quarter of the year. At the time, Mr Buffett hinted to investors that tax implications may have played a role in the sale.\n\nThe latest announcement comes amid broader concern about the potential of an economic downturn ahead. Worse-than-expected jobs data on Aug 2 stoked fears the Federal Reserve may have waited too long to start reducing interest rates, sending the Nasdaq 100 Index into a technical correction.\n\nMegacap peers including Microsoft, Amazon.com and Google parent Alphabet have all tumbled from record highs reached in early July. In total, Nasdaq 100 members have shed more than US$3 trillion in value over that stretch with both Nvidia and Tesla each seeing declines of more than 20 per cent. Apple, meanwhile, is down about 6 per cent from its all-time high.\n\nIt's possible that Berkshire, like an increasing number of investors, wants to see more proof that Apple's AI investments will pay off with revenue growth and isn't convinced that's happening fast enough, according to Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.\n\nOf course, Apple isn't the only stake that Berkshire has trimmed lately - it's been unloading shares of Bank of America, cutting its position by 8.8 per cent since mid-July. Some see that as a sign that Mr Buffett doesn't see any individual problems with either company, but is instead betting that the US consumer and broader economy are set to weaken.\n\n\"Buffett may feel we're about to go into a recession, so by raising cash now he will be able to buy companies cheap later on,\" said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors. . \"He may smell an opportunity coming.\" BLOOMBERG", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His company, Berkshire Hathaway, reduced its Apple holdings by more than $50 billion to $84.2 billion during the second quarter, the report said.\n\nThe data indicates that Berkshire sold around 390 million Apple shares, or about half of its stake, per calculations by the FT. Selling the stocks gives Berkshire a record $277 billion in cash holdings, the report said.\n\nBuffett began scaling back Berkshire's Apple stake last year, and in May reduced it again by around 13%.

Selling Apple before the AI revolution is an error for long term investors,\" Gerber wrote\n\nWarren Buffet doesn't understand technology, thats for sure. Selling Apple before the AI revolution is an error for long term investors... $AAPL -- Ross Gerber (@GerberKawasaki) August 3, 2024\n\nWhy It Matters: The criticism from Gerber comes just days after Buffett significantly reduced Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple. According to a 10-Q report, the value of Berkshire's Apple holdings dropped by nearly 38% from the first to the second quarter of 2024. This reduction has led to a loss of substantial dividend income for Berkshire.\n\nAdditionally, both Bill Gross and Buffett have hinted at a bearish outlook for the stock market, advising investors to consider selling during recoveries rather than buying dips.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed by Elon Musk, who suggested that Buffett's actions indicate an expectation of a correction. Musk wrote, \"He is clearly expecting a correction of some kind or otherwise simply cannot see better investments than Treasury bills.\"\n\nFurthermore, Berkshire Hathaway has been actively selling other significant holdings, including shares of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), amounting to $3.8 billion since mid-July. This series of sales suggests a strategic shift in Buffett's investment approach, focusing on liquidity and potential market downturns.\n\nImage via MidJourney\n\nThis story was generated using Benzinga Neuro and edited by Kaustubh Bagalkote", "source": {"uri": "finance.sina.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_H._Gross", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill H.

The iPhone maker was the first company in history to reach a $1 trillion market cap back in 2018. Today, there are six investable companies with a market cap of $1 trillion or more.\n\nTwo more companies are knocking on the door of the $1 trillion club, though, and Apple may be a big reason why they join the group in the near future. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.86%) (BRK.B -0.80%) and chip-manufacturing giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -5.26%), better known as TSMC, could each get a boost from Apple that pushes them over the milestone.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway holds an equity portfolio worth about $300 billion. Of that, about 29%, $88 billion, is invested in Apple. That's despite some significant sales from the Oracle of Omaha over the past three quarters, including about half Berkshire's stake in the second quarter.\n\nApple remains a favorite investment of Buffett's. Despite the share sales, he fully intends for Apple to remain the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio for the foreseeable future. In 2023, he called Apple \"a better business than any we own,\" referencing the portfolio of wholly owned companies that fall under the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate.\n\nAs long as Berkshire's stake in Apple remains unchanged (far from guaranteed), even a relatively small increase in Apple's share value can add billions to Berkshire's market cap. The conglomerate already has a market cap approaching $950 billion. A strong performance from Apple stock in the second half of the year could be the thing that pushes it to $1 trillion.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway stock currently sports a price-to-book ratio of 1.6 and a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 19.4. Both are fair prices to pay for a conglomerate that is full of businesses with better-than-average growth prospects. With Buffett's consistent share repurchases, massive equity, and Treasury holdings, the prices look even more attractive.\n\nApple has moved toward designing more and more of the silicon chips in its devices since the release of the iPhone in 2007. Not only is it designing more content for the iPhone itself, but it's expanded its in-house designs to all of its growing portfolio of devices, including Macs. And the company manufacturing those chips for Apple, TSMC, is a prime beneficiary of Apple's push to design more of its own silicon.\n\nTSMC could get an additional boost this fall. Apple unveiled Apple AI at its Worldwide Developers Conference in early June. Many Apple fans and analysts are excited about the new AI features, but there are some important details to know.\n\nFirst, Apple AI is only available on the most recent iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. It'll also be available on the forthcoming lineup of iPhone 16s. That could spur a strong upgrade cycle relative to years past. Strong iPhone sales mean strong sales for TSMC. Despite recent growth stemming from its AI chip production, smartphone chips still accounted for one-third of its revenue in Q2 when smartphone sales are typically slower. A surge in demand for smartphone chips heading into the end of the year from Apple could push revenue much higher for the company.\n\nSecond, some Apple AI features rely on securely transmitting data to Apple servers to process AI prompts and queries. Apple is using its own silicon on these servers as well. While Apple's needs may be modest at the launch, they have the potential to scale quickly, especially if Apple opens the protocol to third-party developers. That could push its demand for TSMC chips even higher.\n\nIf TSMC gets a big sales bump from a successful iPhone 16 and Apple AI launch, it could push the company to a $1 trillion market cap. The stock currently touts a market cap of around $850 billion, but it recently flirted with a trillion-dollar market cap. The current pullback looks like a great buying opportunity for the stock.\n\nWhile both of the above companies have significant ties to Apple, investors may be wondering if it makes more sense just to buy Apple shares directly. To be sure, Apple stock looks attractive at its current price despite a forward PE of 29.5 times. The stock arguably merits a premium thanks to its strong cash position and free cash flow generation, which management uses to repurchase shares. That provides a nice boost to earnings per share over time.\n\nBut Berkshire Hathaway provides investors access to Warren Buffett's entire portfolio of diverse businesses, including those wholly owned by the conglomerate. Meanwhile, TSMC is one of the smartest ways to invest in the growing demand for AI chips, as it's the largest chip manufacturer in the world, producing the most cutting-edge chip designs.\n\nAll three fit a certain need for investors, and there's nothing saying you can't buy all of them.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_levy@fool.com", "name": "Adam Levy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P/B_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "B ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Retailers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/785375/getty-images-iphone-apple.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790194", "eventUri": "eng-9790194", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

"body": "New York: Warren Buffett appears to have soured on stocks, letting cash at Berkshire Hathaway soar to nearly US$277bil and selling about half its stake in Apple , even as the conglomerate posted a record quarterly operating profit.\n\nBerkshire's results released last Saturday suggest the 93-year-old Buffett, one of the world's most revered investors, is growing wary about the broader US economy, or stock market valuations that have gotten too high.\n\nThe results followed a stock market sell-off that pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory, and a weak jobs report that sparked worries about US economic activity and whether the US Federal Reserve waited too long to cut interest rates.\n\n\"If you look at the entire Berkshire picture and the macroeconomic data, a safe conclusion is that Berkshire is getting defensive,\" said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire a \"buy\".\n\nBerkshire's cash stake grew to US$276.9bil as of June 30 from a then-record US$189bil three months earlier, largely because Berkshire sold a net US$75.5bil of stocks.\n\nIt sold about 390 million Apple shares in the second quarter, on top of 115 million sold from January to March, as the iPhone maker's stock price rose 23%.\n\nBerkshire still owned about 400 million shares worth US$84.2bil as of June 30.\n\nThe second quarter was the seventh straight quarter that Berkshire sold more stocks than it bought.\n\nBerkshire also repurchased just US$345mil of its own stock, down from US$2.57bil in the first quarter, and none in the first three weeks of July.\n\n\"Buffett doesn't seem to think there are attractive opportunities in publicly traded stocks, including his own,\" said Jim Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst with a \"hold\" rating on Berkshire. \"It makes me worry what he thinks about markets and the economy.\"\n\nGeico boosts results\n\nSecond-quarter profit from Berkshire's dozens of businesses rose 15% to US$11.6bil or about US$8,073 per Class A share, from US$10.04bil a year earlier.\n\nNearly half of that profit came from Berkshire's insurance businesses including Geico car insurance, where underwriting profit more than tripled as premiums rose and claims fell.\n\nBut revenue rose just 1% to US$93.65bil with little change in major businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and a 12% drop at the Pilot truck-stop chain.\n\nConsumers also showed signs of cutting back, causing revenue to decline at Berkshire's more than 80 auto dealerships because they spent less per vehicle on new cars, trucks and SUVs.\n\nBerkshire's returns from short-term Treasuries should decline once rate cuts begin.\n\nShanahan said that and revenue headwinds \"may make it tough for Berkshire to deliver earnings growth in 2025\".\n\nThe Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns many industrial and manufacturing companies, a big real estate brokerage, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom.\n\nQuarterly net income fell 15% to US$30.34bil from US$35.91bil a year earlier, as rising stock prices in both periods boosted the value of Berkshire's stock investments.\n\nBuffett has long urged shareholders to ignore Berkshire's quarterly investment gains and losses, which often lead to outsized net profits or net losses.\n\nBuffett wants to spend, but doesn't\n\nBerkshire pledges to keep a minimum US$30bil of cash, but often lets it build up when it can't find whole businesses or individual stocks to buy at fair prices.\n\nSince mid-July, Berkshire has also sold more than US$3.8bil of shares in Bank of America, its second-largest stock holding.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said at Berkshire's May 4 annual meeting, referring to Berkshire's cash.\n\nBuffett said he expected Apple to remain Berkshire's largest stock investment, but selling made sense because the 21% federal tax rate on the gains would likely grow.\n\nThe sales came only two years after Buffett labelled Apple one of Berkshire's \"four giants\", along with its insurance businesses, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.\n\nBerkshire and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment last Saturday.\n\nProfit at BNSF fell 3% as the railroad set aside more money for lawsuits, offsetting lower operating costs and greater shipping of consumer and agricultural products.\n\nLawsuits against the PacifiCorp utility unit also weighed on Berkshire Hathaway Energy, where profit fell 17%.\n\nMany homeowners and businesses blame PacifiCorp for causing Oregon wildfires in 2020. The utility set aside US$2.7bil for wildfire losses as of June 30, up from US$2.4bil three months earlier, and said losses could grow significantly.\n\nBerkshire's Class A shares closed last Friday at US$641,435. They are up 18% this year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 is up 12%.\n\nBuffett has led Berkshire since 1965. Vice-chairman Greg Abel, 62, is expected to succeed him as chief executive. -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Is it time to run?", "body": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) released its second-quarter results over the weekend. The big news was the company's ongoing sale of its Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares, but that's not the only stock the Oracle of Omaha has been decreasing its holdings in.\n\nLast Thursday (US time), in another filing to the US regulatory body, Berkshire reported that it sold more shares of Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) from 30 July to 1 August. As the disposal continues, Berkshire's holding in the bank has reduced to 12.15%.\n\nWarren Buffett keeps his lips tight and there could be many reasons why he's selling his banking shares.\n\nOne reason many pundits suspect is that he wants to keep his holding in Bank of America shares under 10%. As an owner of more than 10%, Berkshire has to report any transactions within two business days.\n\nWhile this may be a reason, it doesn't explain Berkshire's sale of other banking shares, including Wells Fargo and JP Morgan. As highlighted above, the company is also selling Apple shares, piling up cash.\n\nAt the end of June 2024, Berkshire holds US$277 billion in cash, representing nearly 30% of its current market capitalisation of US$938 billion. This is a lot of cash.\n\nThis raises the question of whether Warren Buffett sees the outlook for the stock market and economy as gloomy. He famously said, \"Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.\" Is he implying that the market is too greedy now?\n\nWhile he doesn't own ASX banking shares directly, this might be a good time for a reality check.\n\nSurely, ASX banking shares had a fantastic run over the past year. Let's first look at their valuations. Based on S&P Capital IQ earnings estimates for FY25:\n\nThese valuation levels are generally at the high end of their historical trading ranges, which has led to debates among experts on whether it is time to take profits on leading ASX banking shares such as CBA.\n\nWhile the banking sector and the broader ASX index are trading lower this morning, Macquarie sees a 'tactical buying opportunity' in ANZ shares.

For context, Berkshire sold 'just' $26 billion worth of equity securities in the same period in 2023.\n\nBut it also suggests that little has changed in Buffet's mind over the past 12 months.\n\nThis time last year, Buffett said he will continue to grow Berkshire's T-bills holdings for lack of attractive investment opportunities.\n\nThe suggestion was, it's better to hold cash than buy businesses just for the hell of it, thus implying that there was nothing decent to buy at the time.\n\nGiven Buffett's persistent Scrooge McDuck approach to holding cash, it's safe to say little has changed.\n\nSome of this cash has gone to share repurchases- roughly $345 million the second quarter and $2.3 billion in the first quarter, per Berkshire's 10Q filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nBut the real question is, when will the floodgates open once again?

"US-based multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway has significantly reduced its stake in tech giant Apple, selling nearly half of its shares as part of a substantial selling spree.\n\nThe conglomerate, based in Omaha, Nebraska, reported net stock sales totalling $75.5bn during the second quarter.\n\nBerkshire's decision to cut its Apple investment comes despite Warren Buffett's previous praise for the technology giant and its business model.\n\nSince first reporting its Apple stake in 2016, Berkshire Hathaway has seen substantial gains from the investment, according to Bloomberg.\n\nInitially spending $31.1bn for 908 million shares, the company's remaining 400 million shares were valued at $84.2bn at the end of June.\n\nIn a note, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Matthew Palazola and Eric Bedell said that Berkshire's stock sales \"are likely aimed at avoiding higher capital gains taxes, and profit harvesting may continue in some long-term positions.\"\n\nAt the May shareholder meeting, Buffett stated that Apple is an \"even better\" business compared to American Express and Coca-Cola, two other companies in which Berkshire holds shares.\n\nHe mentioned that Apple is expected to continue being its leading investment.\n\nThe news of Berkshire's reduced stake in Apple coincides with Apple's latest financial results.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company reported a decline in sales to China, down 6.5% to $14.7bn, falling short of Wall Street's $15.3bn projection for the third quarter.\n\nDespite this, Apple's net income rose to $21.4bn in the quarter that ended 29 June 2024, up from $19.88bn in the same period last year.\n\nFor the quarter ending 29 June, Apple posted total net sales of $85.77bn, an increase from the $81.79bn reported in the previous year's quarter.\n\nThis growth was propelled by an increase in service revenues, which climbed to $24.21bn from $21.21bn, and a modest rise in product sales from $60.58bn to $61.56bn.\n\nApple's board of directors has announced a cash dividend of $0.25 per share for the company's common stock.\n\nThis dividend will be distributed on 15 August 2024, to shareholders who are on record as of the end of business on 12 August 2024.", "source": {"uri": "verdict.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Verdict"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shivam_mishra@verdict.co.uk", "name": "Shivam

Grogen | CNBC\n\nWarren Buffett sent shockwaves through the investing world over the weekend by slashing his big Apple stake by half, causing the tech stock to crater on Monday amid the intensifying global sell-off.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway disclosed in its earnings filing that its Apple holding was valued at $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, indicating that the Oracle of Omaha dumped a little more than 49% of the tech stake.\n\nShares of Apple dropped more than 7% in premarket trading Monday. Global stock markets are on the brink of a major correction, triggered by concerns of an economic slowdown.\n\nThe 93-year-old legendary investor has been on a massive selling spree, offloading more than $75 billion in equities in the second quarter and raising Berkshire's cash pile to a whopping $277 billion, an all-time high for the conglomerate. Buffett also started selling his second-biggest holding Bank of America in July.\n\nBuffett had already sold 13% of his Apple stake in the first quarter and he indicated previously that it was a tax-saving move as he expected the U.S. government to raise the rate to fund a burgeoning fiscal deficit. However, the magnitude of the second-quarter sale could mean tax was not the only motivating factor.\n\nBerkshire began buying the stock in 2016 under the influence of Buffett's investing lieutenants Ted Weschler and Todd Combs. Over the years, Buffett grew so fond of Apple that he increased the stake drastically to make it Berkshire's biggest and called the tech giant the second-most important business after his cluster of insurers.\n\nBerkshire's Apple holding grew so big that it once took up half its equity portfolio, so the selling could also be out of portfolio management concerns.\n\nShares of Apple climbed 23% to a record high in the second quarter amid renewed optimism surrounding its artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nDon't miss these insights from CNBC PRO\n\nREAD SOURCE", "source": {"uri": "businesstelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Weschler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Weschler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.businesstelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Apple-shares-drop-7-after-Warren-Buffett039s-Berkshire-Hathaway-slashes.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790194", "eventUri": "eng-9790194", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 460560172, "relevance": 2}

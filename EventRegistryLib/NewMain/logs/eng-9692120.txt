Y. Chandrachud and others during regional conference of the National Judicial Academy, in Kolkata, Saturday, June 29, 2024.(IANS)\n\nKolkata, June 29 (IANS) The Chief Justice of India (CJI), DY Chandrachud, on Saturday, observed that the trend of equating judges with God is dangerous since the task of judges is to serve public interest.\n\n\"Too very often, we are addressed as Honour or as Lordship or as Ladyship. There is a very grave danger when people say that the court is a temple of justice. There is a grave danger that we perceive ourselves as the deities in those temples,\" CJI Chandrachud said while addressing the Regional Conference of National Judicial Academy here on Saturday morning.\n\nThe CJI said that he feels reticent when he is told that the court is the temple of justice because the temple postulates that the judges are in the position of a deity.\n\n\"I would rather recast the role of the judge as a server of the people. And when you regard yourselves as people who are there to serve others, then you bring in the notion of compassion, of empathy, of judging but not being judgmental about others,\" the CJI said.\n\nHe said that even while sentencing anyone in a criminal case, the judges do that with a sense of compassion, since at the end, a human being is being sentenced.\n\n\"So these concepts of constitutional morality, which I think, are the key, not just for the judges of the Supreme Court or the High Court but also for the district judiciary itself, because the engagement of the common citizens begins first and foremost with the district judiciary,\" CJI Chandrachud said.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, he strongly stressed on the relevance of technology in the functioning of the judiciary.\n\nAccording to CJI Chandrachud, language is the central barrier to accessing and understanding verdicts by common people.\n\n\"Technology can provide us with some answers. Most judgments are written in English. Technology has enabled us to translate them. We are translating 51,000 judgments in other languages,\" CJI Chandrachud said.\n\nThe judicial system of the country should be politically unbiased, honest and pure, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Saturday.\n\n\"We have 88 fast-track courts in West Bengal, out of which 55 are for women only. We have 99 human rights courts in the state. My only plea is that the judicial system of the country should be totally unbiased, pure and honest. Secrecy should be maintained,\" Banerjee said while addressing the Regional Conference of the National Judicial Academy here on Saturday morning.\n\nChief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud and Calcutta High Court Chief Justice T.S.

I am still a member of the bar association.

The common people believe that only the judicial system can relieve them of their problems. Justice Chandrachud has undoubtedly helped in improving the judicial system of the country.

We are translating 51,000 judgments in other languages.\n\nThe Chief Justice of India (CJI), DY Chandrachud, today (June 29), observed that the trend of equating judges with God in India is dangerous since the task of the judges is to serve the public interest. CJI said that he feels reticent when he is told that the court is the temple of justice because the temple postulates that the judges are in the position of a deity.\n\n\"Too very often, we are addressed as Honour or as Lordship or as Ladyship. There is a very grave danger when people say that the court is a temple of justice. There is a grave danger that we perceive ourselves as the deities in those temples,\" CJI Chandrachud said while addressing the Regional Conference of National Judicial Academy in Kolkata on Saturday morning.\n\n\"I would rather recast the role of the judge as a server of the people. And when you regard yourselves as people who are there to serve others, then you bring in the notion of compassion, of empathy, of judging but not being judgmental about others,\" the CJI said.\n\nHe said that even while sentencing anyone in a criminal case, the judges do that with a sense of compassion, since at the end, a human being is being sentenced.\n\nWhile addressing a conference on Contemporary Judicial Developments in Kolkata, Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud said, \"The word 'contemporary' is very important because it does not speak about the work which we do in the abstract, but in the context of contemporary societal challenges which we as judges face in the work we do. We, therefore, look at the law and its intersection of technology from the perspective of the societal conditions in which those whom we serve exist in our societies.\"\n\n\"So these concepts of constitutional morality, which I think, are the key, not just for the judges of the Supreme Court or the High Court but also for the district judiciary itself, because the engagement of the common citizens begins first and foremost with the district judiciary,\" CJI Chandrachud said.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, he strongly stressed on the relevance of technology in the functioning of the judiciary.\n\nAccording to CJI Chandrachud, language is the central barrier to accessing and understanding verdicts by common people. \"Technology can provide us with some answers. Most judgments are written in English. Technology has enabled us to translate them.

Addressing a conference on Contemporary Judicial Developments in Kolkata CJI Chandrachud said that \"constitutional morality\" reflects an institution's commitment of the Court system.\n\n\"Too very often, when we are addressed as Honour or as Lordship or as Ladyship. There is a very grave danger when people say that the court is a temple of justice. There is a grave danger that we perceive ourselves as the deities in those temples,\" Chandrachud said. The CJI said that \"he feels reticent when he is told that the court is the temple of justice because the temple postulates that the judges are in the position of a deity.\"\n\n\"I would rather recast the role of the judge as a server of the people. And when you regard yourselves as people who are there to serve others, then you bring in the notion of compassion, of empathy, of judging but not being judgmental about others,\" the CJI said. He further emphasized on the word 'contemporary' and said that the word itself speaks about in the context of contemporary societal challenges which the judges face in the work they do.\n\n\"This conference speaks on Contemporary Judicial Developments and strengthening justice through law and technology. The word 'contemporary' is very important because it does not speak about the work which we do in the abstract, but in the context of contemporary societal challenges which we as judges face in the work we do. We, therefore, look at the law and its intersection of technology from the perspective of the societal conditions in which those whom we serve exist in our societies because the true merit of our work lies in addressing challenges faced by those at whose feet we are intended to serve the common citizens of India,\" he said. He further said that the people exist in a federal structure that is marked by a great deal of diversity.\n\n\"I was born in Mumbai, belong to a small village located 60-70 kilometers away from Pune. The work as judges we do in Delhi is to realize the importance of preserving the diversity of India. So how do we then dwell on the constitutional of morality? At one level constitutional morality is founded in the permeable values. The values which the Constitution, Preamble sets out,\" he added. The CJI said that C onstitutional morality addresses itself in every component of society.\n\n\"The Consitution is not merely a dialogue between the states and its citizens, or Union or the states, or States and States. It is a dialogue within and between the societies. The Consitution Morality itself addresses to every component of society,\" he said. He said that even while sentencing anyone in a criminal case, the judges do that with a sense of compassion, since at the end, a human being is being sentenced.\n\n\"So these concepts of constitutional morality, which I think, are the key, not just for the judges of the Supreme Court or the High Court but also for the district judiciary itself, because the engagement of the common citizens begins first and foremost with the district judiciary,\" CJI Chandrachud said. He further stressed on the relevance of technology in the functioning of the judiciary and said that the language is the central barrier to accessing and understanding verdicts by common people.\n\n\"Technology can provide us with some answers. Most judgments are written in English. Technology has enabled us to translate them. We are translating 51,000 judgments in other languages,\" CJI said.

There is a very grave danger when people say that the court is a temple of justice. There is a grave danger that we perceive ourselves as the deities in those temples,\" Chandrachud said.\n\nThe CJI said that \"he feels reticent when he is told that the court is the temple of justice because the temple postulates that the judges are in the position of a deity.\"\n\n\"I would rather recast the role of the judge as a server of the people. And when you regard yourselves as people who are there to serve others, then you bring in the notion of compassion, of empathy, of judging but not being judgmental about others,\" the CJI said.\n\nHe further emphasized on the word 'contemporary' and said that the word itself speaks about in the context of contemporary societal challenges which the judges face in the work they do.\n\n\"This conference speaks on Contemporary Judicial Developments and strengthening justice through law and technology. The word 'contemporary' is very important because it does not speak about the work which we do in the abstract, but in the context of contemporary societal challenges which we as judges face in the work we do. We, therefore, look at the law and its intersection of technology from the perspective of the societal conditions in which those whom we serve exist in our societies because the true merit of our work lies in addressing challenges faced by those at whose feet we are intended to serve the common citizens of India,\" he said.\n\nHe further said that the people exist in a federal structure that is marked by a great deal of diversity.\n\n\"I was born in Mumbai, belong to a small village located 60-70 kilometers away from Pune. The work as judges we do in Delhi is to realize the importance of preserving the diversity of India. So how do we then dwell on the constitutional of morality? At one level constitutional morality is founded in the permeable values. The values which the Constitution, Preamble sets out,\" he added.\n\nThe CJI said that C onstitutional morality addresses itself in every component of society.\n\n\"The Consitution is not merely a dialogue between the states and its citizens, or Union or the states, or States and States. It is a dialogue within and between the societies. The Consitution Morality itself addresses to every component of society,\" he said.\n\nHe said that even while sentencing anyone in a criminal case, the judges do that with a sense of compassion, since at the end, a human being is being sentenced.\n\n\"So these concepts of constitutional morality, which I think, are the key, not just for the judges of the Supreme Court or the High Court but also for the district judiciary itself, because the engagement of the common citizens begins first and foremost with the district judiciary,\" CJI Chandrachud said.\n\nHe further stressed on the relevance of technology in the functioning of the judiciary and said that the language is the central barrier to accessing and understanding verdicts by common people.\n\n\"Technology can provide us with some answers. Most judgments are written in English. Technology has enabled us to translate them. We are translating 51,000 judgments in other languages,\" CJI said.

Because that would mean the judges are deities which they are not. They are instead servers of the people, who deliver justice with compassion and empathy,\" CJI Chandrachud said at the conference titled 'Contemporary Judicial Developments and Strengthening Justice Through Law and Technology'.\n\nCalling judges \"servants and not masters of the Constitution\", the CJI warned the judiciary of the pitfalls of personal values and belief systems of judges interfering with judgments that are opposed to values enshrined in the Constitution.\n\n\"We could be masters of Constitutional interpretation, but a just society is established with the court's vision of Constitutional Morality,\" he said.\n\nWhile speaking on the need for technological assistance in ensuring the effective delivery of justice to citizens, the CJI said, \"The idea is to not modernise for the sake of modernisation. It is a step to aid something else we want to achieve.\" CJI Chandrachud spoke of AI-assisted software aiding the work-in-progress to translate the 37,000-odd Supreme Court judgments delivered since Independence from English into all Constitution-recognised regional languages.\n\nMaking available digitised formats of Supreme Court judgments free for all, decentralised access to courts to provide travel relief to litigants, using technology to create awareness of court procedures and categorisation of cases are also some of the technology-driven measures in aiding effective justice which the CJI spoke about.\n\nDelivering a special address at the programme, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee appealed to members of the judiciary to ensure that political bias should not interfere with the justice delivery system.\n\n\"Judiciary should be pure, honest and sacred. I believe that the judiciary is of, by and for the people. If the judiciary cannot deliver justice to people, who can? It's the ultimate frontier for getting justice and the last recourse to save our country's democracy and our Constitution,\" Banerjee said.\n\nChief Justice of Calcutta High Court TS Sivagnanam was also present at the programme which was organised in collaboration with the Calcutta High Court and West Bengal Judicial Academy.

Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud backed her views and said judges should refrain from allowing their personal beliefs to influence their rulings.\n\nSpeaking at a conference on contemporary judicial developments in Kolkata, Banerjee described the judiciary as an \"important temple\" for citizens, and it serves as the last frontier for getting justice and upholding constitutional rights.\n\n\"It is not my intention to humiliate anyone, but my kind submission is that please see that there is no political bias in the judiciary. The judiciary must be absolutely pure, honest and sacred,\" she said.\n\n\"The judiciary is an important temple for us. It is just like 'mandir (temple), masjid (mosque), gurdwara and girjaghar (church)'. It is our supreme authority to deliver justice to the people. I believe this judiciary is of the people, for the people, by the people,\" she said.\n\nThe Chief Minister said the people have hopes in the judiciary as they believe they will get justice from the courts.\n\n\"If the judiciary cannot help common people, where will they get justice? When they face any problem or anything atrocious, they only hope with greater interest that the judiciary can solve their problems. It is the last frontier for getting justice and upholding constitutional rights,\" she said.\n\n\"The judiciary is a big pillar and serves as the foundation of our country to save democracy, Constitution and people's interests,\" she added.\n\nBanerjee underlined that the West Bengal government gave Rs 1,000 crore for the development of the judiciary and provided land for constructing a new High Court in Kolkata's Rajarhat area.\n\n\"We have 88 fast-track courts. Earlier, the government should have given us assistance for setting up fast-track courts. They withdrew facilities seven to eight years ago. But now, we are the only state having 88 fast-track courts of which 55 are women's fast-track courts,\" she said.\n\nOn his part, CJI Chandrachud laid emphasis on how judgments should be based on constitutional morality and not a judge's concept of morality.\n\n\"Increasingly, we see judges writing on their ideologies. For example, a judge stating that he won't give protection to a couple who are staying together, as they are in a consensual relationship outside marriage. The law protects relationships which are in the nature of marriage, yet we find judges writing that they cannot give protection,\" he said.\n\n\"Even if there is a risk of honour killing of the couple, is this the true nature of a judge? Or are they giving effect to their own personal ideas on what is moral and what is immoral, rather than upholding constitutional morality?\" he added.\n\nThe Chief Justice cited specific examples to illustrate his point. He mentioned cases where judges denied protecting couples in interfaith marriages because they had not obtained parental consent.\n\n\"Is the judge giving their personal view on how society has to live? We are servants of the Constitution, not masters,\" he argued, emphasising that personal prejudices and societal norms should not cloud judicial decisions.\n\nHe said the role of the judges is to serve the people and cautioned against the perceived notion of them being viewed as deities.\n\n\"I am a little reticent when I am told that this is the temple of justice. There is a grave perception that we are perceived as deities in the temple. I am recasting the role of judges as the servers of the people. By doing that, you bring in the notion of compassion, empathy of judging others but not being judgmental about others,\" he added.\n\nHe also said the Supreme Court is the court of \"last resort\" and the district courts across the country are the \"first resort\" for people seeking justice.\n\nTalking about women empowerment, CJI Chandrachud said, \"It should be encouraged in the judiciary. Amenities for women are lacking. Women have multiple things to do. I, as CJI, started an initiative where meals for Rs 25 can be served,\" he said.\n\n\"I urge our legal community to work on them and strengthen such measures. We must support and mentor young women who come into this profession so that they can take charge,\" he added.\n\nHe said citizens believe that adjournment in cases is a routine process, which leads to delays in justice, and thereby causes a distrust in the system.\n\n\"We must open up access to the Supreme Court for everyone. A citizen does not know the procedures. E-filling allows citizens to access procedures. Our duty is to see that orders are implemented through technology,\" the Chief Justice further said.\n\nThe Chief Justice was in Kolkata for the bicentenary celebration of Calcutta High Court's Bar Library Club.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamata_Banerjee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mamata Banerjee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhananjaya_Y._Chandrachud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhananjaya Y.

He further urged the legal community to strengthen such measures and support young women entering the profession so that they can take charge.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajarhat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajarhat"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfaith_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interfaith marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/29035221719652358.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692120", "eventUri": "eng-9692120", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

He explained that constitutional morality, distinct from general morality, imposes obligations on the state to construct a society as outlined by the Constitution.\n\nChandrachud described constitutional morality as a comprehensive principle emerging from the Constitution's values, which grants every citizen the freedom to think, speak, worship, and marry as they choose. He urged judges to view themselves as servants of the people, promoting compassion and empathy in the judicial process.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Judicial_Academy_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Judicial Academy (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehsil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tehsil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Morality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Morality", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/20_04_2024_14_03_50_25068.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692120", "eventUri": "eng-9692120", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Zidane spoke in an interview with Telefoot, where he claimed that Mbappe would 'surpass everyone' and leave a lasting legacy at the club. Real Madrid announced the signing of the former Paris Saint-Germain superstar on a free transfer on June 3. He joins the club upon the expiration of his PSG contract. \"Mbappe is here now. He will make history at the club and I think he\u2019ll surpass everyone.\" Mbappe has broken several records in his senior career so far, bagging goals for fun at club and international level. In his seven years at PSG, he racked up 256 goals and 108 assists in 308 games across all competitions. He is the Parisians all-time top scorer. He is the French national team's third-highest goalscorer of all time with 47 strikes in 78 games. Mbappe was a key member of the France squad that won the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and scored a hat trick in the final of the 2022 edition, but fell short to Argentina and Lionel Messi on penalties. He is also the captain of the national side, having taken over from Hugo Lloris after his retirement at the conclusion of the 2022 World Cup.", "summary": "<img width=\"1320\" height=\"743\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zidane.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zidane.jpg 1320w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zidane-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Zidane-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1320px) 100vw, 1320px\" /><p>Former Real Madrid midfielder and manager, Zinedine Zidane has made a bold prediction about the club&#8217;s new signing, Kylian Mbappe&#8217;s future.

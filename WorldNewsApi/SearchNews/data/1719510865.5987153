United clinched their first FA Cup crown in seven years with a 2-1 victory in the capital. Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo scored in the first half to put the Reds in charge against their cross-city rivals by the half-time interval. Jeremy Doku, who was introduced from the substitutes bench, pulled a goal back for City in the closing stages to set up a tense finale, but United held firm to get the job done. It marked a second trophy in as many seasons under manager Erik ten Hag.

Ten Hag nailed his tactical approach, limiting City to very few clear sightings of United's goal, particularly in the first half. And while Dalot accepted Ten Hag's tactical approach was vitally important, he felt the mentality of the whole group was just as significant. Dalot told MUTV: \"More than the game plan, it was the mentality, you could smell it. \"In the dressing room before the game, we were connected with each other and we were ready like I had never seen this season and pretty much last year. We really enjoyed it, 100 per cent, and today we showed that if we have this mentality we can beat anyone.\" Martinez, who made his second consecutive start after an injury-plagued campaign, echoed Dalot's assessment, insisting there was a feeling of unity and togetherness inside the dressing room ahead of kick-off. \"It demands a lot of energy and concentration,\" admitted Martinez. \"But when everyone is involved... for example, today, before the game, we looked in the eyes of everyone and everyone was here. \"We were connected all together by the energy, positivity and we did it. We deserve it as well.\"", "summary": "Man United beat rivals Manchester City in the FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday, winning 2-1.", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/diogo-dalot-lisandro-martinez-agree-29241384", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29241394.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screenshot-2024-05-26-at-094856.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:14:40", "author": "George Smith", "authors": ["George Smith"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.043}

She\u2019s always filling up expensive bottles of things with stuff from a cheaper brand. She\u2019s done it for years. It\u2019s usually with the bottles of hand soaps in our downstairs bathroom, but she\u2019s also done it with diffusers and shampoos. I\u2019m always teasing her and saying \u201cthis isn\u2019t the real thing, is it?\u201d But one time I did it in front of her sister and Marian got really annoyed. She said I\u2019d shown her up, but I just think it\u2019s amusing. For years now Marian has been filling up luxury hand soap bottles with soap we buy at Lidl. What\u2019s funny is that she doesn\u2019t do it in our private bathroom \u2013 because other people won\u2019t see it there \u2013 but she will everywhere else. The expensive bottles are starting to wear a bit now, but she won\u2019t throw them out because they\u2019ve got a prestigious label on them. Marian also does it with diffusers. She loves Jo Malone diffuser sets and bought a few for our house years ago. But when they started to lose their smell, she filled up the bottles with diffusers from Aldi. It is quite genius to be fair, and I did approve at first because I thought the originals were far too costly. But I don\u2019t like what it represents. I grew up on a farm in rural England, in a family of eight, and we were a very \u201cwhat you see is what you get\u201d family. My dad was a bit rough around the edges and my brothers and sisters don\u2019t have any airs and graces about them. If I mentioned to them that Marian is so bothered about what people think of her that she\u2019s keeping branded bottles around our house to make herself look posh, they\u2019d all rip the piss out of her. But I can\u2019t do that because Marian is embarrassed by it. We\u2019ve been married 15 years and she\u2019s always been quite glam, but I do think this is ridiculous. If you\u2019re going to be cheap, just own it, that\u2019s what I say. Ironically, it\u2019s the well off, middle classes who seem most preoccupied with looking as if they\u2019ve got more than they do. The defence: Marian I just think: do you want nice interiors on a budget price, or not? Like many women, I am responsible for making sure our shared house is not a stinky man cave, so of course I buy things like diffusers and nice soaps. Ted likes these, but gets shocked about how much they actually cost. So once they\u2019ve run out, I don\u2019t always fill them up with the original brand. This has been at his encouragement, but then he tells me that I\u2019m obsessed with class and money for doing so. I just think: do you want nice interiors on a budget price, or not? Aldi does a great range of refills which smell like the originals, but I also don\u2019t want to throw away my expensive Jo Malone bottle and replace it with something that is obviously not designer. It makes far more sense to keep the nice bottle \u2013 I reject the idea that this means I\u2019m obsessed with \u201ckeeping up appearances\u201d. It\u2019s just common sense. It\u2019s the same with the soaps. I guess because I only do this in our guest bathroom, it\u2019s a little harder to defend. I like the idea of making my guests feel special, and part of that involves having fancier products on display for them to use. I know they aren\u2019t actually using them, it\u2019s just the idea of the thing \u2013 I\u2019m trying to create an aesthetic. If anything, it\u2019s an act of generosity. I\u2019m letting people think they are stepping into a house of luxury even if they are really using the cheap stuff. Ted grew up in a working-class household in Yorkshire, whereas my parents were \u201ccity folk\u201d, as he calls them. My mum was a lawyer before she retired and my dad worked in insurance. I think they cared a lot about what people thought of them. We always rolled out the good biscuits and the best china when guests came over, and my dad took great pride in making sure our garden was the best-kept on our street. I\u2019ve retained that house pride, but times are tough so I am trying to do it on a budget. Ted should be grateful he\u2019s got such a savvy wife and not out me in front of people like my sister when they visit. I\u2019ll continue to do this as long as I like. The jury of Guardian readers Should Marian stop putting cheap soap in posh bottles? I understand Marian\u2019s aesthetic reasoning for reusing the bottles, but I find it strange she\u2019s been doing it for years, feigning a life she cannot afford. Presumably her guests like her for her, and not the luxury items she displays. Manon, 31 I would caution Marian against being so image-conscious in other aspects of her life. But using refills is a smart option \u2013 it makes sense to keep the nicer bottles and refill them with a cheaper alternative. She should consider buying larger containers in bulk to cut down on plastic waste and save money.Oliver, 24 Marian only does this in guest areas so is clearly doing it for show \u2013 she sounds like a right Hyacinth Bucket! True friends don\u2019t care what soap is in your bathroom. If the supermarket ones are more affordable and smell great, use them.Louise, 41 As Marian points out, it\u2019s usually a woman\u2019s job to keep the house looking nice, and Ted should be grateful. Of course, true friends don\u2019t care about which soap you use, but it\u2019s not only true friends who enter your home. Second-tier friends and neighbours do, too. Who can blame Marian for wanting to keep up appearances?Zoe, 67 Marian shouldn\u2019t be so concerned by what others think \u2013 particularly her own sister. But Ted is in the wrong here, too: maybe he should take charge of making the house smell nice \u2013 I bet he\u2019d be refilling bottles within two months.Alan, 45 Now you be the judge In our online poll, tell us: should Marian stop refilling posh bottles with cheap soap?

{"id": 225058584, "title": "Morning Bid: Fed in a bind as consumers stay upbeat", "text": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan World markets wobbled on Tuesday, with benchmark bond yields and volatility gauges jumping to their highest in almost four weeks, as more evidence of the stoic U.S. consumer alongside runaway tech stocks leaves the Federal Reserve with a conundrum. Also agitated by Tuesday's whopping $297 billion sale of Treasury notes and bills and a tepid investor response, 10-year benchmark yields hit their highest level since May 3.

The question for the Fed in all of this is whether the rising stock market is undermining its credit market tightening, despite benchmark borrowing and long-term mortgage rates being at their highest in a decade.

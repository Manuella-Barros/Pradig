We do not support it. We don't believe that they have the jurisdiction. And I'm just going to leave it there for now,\" the Hill reported White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre to have said last week.\n\nIn 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials for war crimes committed in the invasion of Ukraine. At the time, the Biden administration pledged to help the ICC in its efforts.\n\nThe ICC can prosecute individuals for alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Currently, Israel is facing genocide accusations brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which has imposed provisional measures in Israel's Gaza offensive.\n\nSince 7 October, Israeli forces have killed more than 34,600 people in Gaza -- a death toll that could surge if Israel moves ahead with its planned ground invasion of Rafah. Women and children account for up to 70 per cent of those killed by Israel's military thus far.\n\nIsrael commenced the attack on Gaza following the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas which led to the death of about 1,200 people.", "source": {"uri": "premiumtimesng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Premium Times Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kabir_yusuf@premiumtimesng.com", "name": "Kabir

The court shot back against the lawmakers' threats, though they did not name the US specifically.\"Target Israel and we will target you,\" the senators said in a letter to ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan. The US lawmakers added that if the ICC does so, they will \"sanction your employees and associates, and bar you and your families from the US.\" \"You have been warned,\" they ominously added. The US lawmakers indirectly threatened to invoke the American Service-Members' Protection Act (ASPA) in response to any arrest warrants. The act was signed into law in 2002 as a way for the US to protect itself against any accountability the ICC may seek and allows the US president to prevent Americans and other allies from being detained by the court. The legislation has been condemned by human rights organizations.The ICC has reportedly considered a warrant for Netanyahu for some time as they have been investigating since 2021 possible war crimes committed by Israeli forces and Palestinian militants that date back to the 2014 Israel-Hamas war. That investigation then extended to the October 7, 2023 attack and the ongoing war.Israel has made claims to the US that the Palestinian Authority officials are coercing the ICC prosecutor to issue arrest warrants against Israeli leaders. They then warned the Biden administration that if the ICC does issue arrest warrants against Israeli leaders they will ensure the Palestinian Authority's collapse, a recent report detailed.In response, the court said they seek to \"engage constructively with all stakeholders\".\"That independence and impartiality are undermined, however, when individuals threaten to retaliate against the Court or against Court personnel should the Office, in fulfillment of its mandate, make decisions about investigations or cases falling within its jurisdiction,\" the statement continues.The Biden administration has not commented on whether they will pursue actions against the ICC if they issue arrest warrants for Israeli officials, thought they have said that they do not support it.\"We've been really clear about the ICC investigation.

Here is why.\n\nEstablished in 2002, the ICC is an international court that has the ability to prosecute individuals accused of criminal conduct including genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression.\n\nUnlike the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which is also based at The Hague and adjudicates the responsibility of states, the ICC does not indict a state or a people. In his video statement last week, Netanyahu said the ICC arrest warrants would \"put Israel in the dock.\" This view is wrong. ICC prosecutions are limited to questions of accountability of individuals for their own conduct alleged as crimes. The ICC will not indict the state of Israel or its citizenry.\n\nThe ICC can prosecute nationals of a state that is party to the Rome Statute. It can also prosecute crimes committed on the territory of a state that is party to the treaty whether or not the defendant's state is party to the Rome Statute.\n\nEven though Israel is not a party to the treaty, Palestine is a member state. Thus, the ICC can prosecute Israeli officials for complicity in crimes that Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers allegedly committed on Palestinian territory. Conversely, the court has jurisdiction over individual members of Hamas (as Palestinian nationals) for the international crimes they allegedly committed in Israel as well.\n\nThe same legal principle has been used in the case of Russia, which is not a party to the Rome Statue. In 2022, a group of 39 countries, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, called on the ICC to investigate the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This resulted in the ICC issuing an arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin for committing war crimes on Ukrainian territory -- a move that was applauded by U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nThus, it would be contradictory for any of these states to accept the ICC's jurisdiction over Russian nationals but not those of Israel.\n\nOn the eve of his appointment as the United States' chief prosecutor for the Nuremberg trials, Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson said, \"We cannot successfully cooperate with the rest of the world in establishing a reign of law unless we are prepared to have that law sometimes operate against what would be our national advantage.\" This is a rule of good faith that must guide attitudes toward the world's top courts.\n\nIn inquiring into a charge, the ICC singularly focuses on whether the defendant is guilty of the crime as charged according to international law. That inquiry is devoid of politics -- or political interference.\n\nIt is regrettable that some states have been unwilling to support the court -- notably in the execution of arrest warrants -- when their friends and allies are concerned. For example, many African and Middle Eastern governments, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Malawi, Nigeria, and South Africa, failed to arrest former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir when he traveled to their countries.\n\nThis has left many of the court's arrests warrants unexecuted. In some instances, member states such as Canada, Germany, Nigeria, and the U.K. have made public statements in support of their political allies in situations before the court, notwithstanding that such statements are purely political and tend to undermine the global perception of the court.\n\nThough it remains unconfirmed, it is likely that any ICC arrest warrant against Israeli officials would include the charge of the use of starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza, given the utterances of Israeli officials themselves and the obstruction of food and aid that have been widely decried by many.\n\nHowever, arrest warrants and indictments do not mean that the persons charged are guilty of the crimes. While an ICC inquiry is ongoing, the defendant will enjoy the presumption of innocence throughout and will be afforded every opportunity to defend themselves.\n\nAt the end of the trial, the three judges will decide -- by majority -- whether the evidence the prosecutor marshaled against the defendant satisfied the required standard of proof for conviction. And that bar is very high.\n\nWhile there have been many cases at the ICC where the judges convicted the defendants because that high standard of proof was met, there have also been cases in which ICC judges have acquitted defendants at the end of their trials or appeals. Notable examples include former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo and one of his ministers, Charles Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9, who were acquitted at their trial. The conviction of Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former Congolese senator and vice president, was overturned on appeal.\n\nUltimately, the question turns to what arrest warrants would mean, in the meantime, for Israeli officials. Based on the ICC's previous experience, it would not mean an immediate arrest and trial. Bashir has still not been arrested or tried, even though his arrest warrant was issued in 2009. For a long time, before he was deposed, he kept traveling to friendly states that did not arrest him. Their argument was that customary international law recognized immunity for him as a head of state. But finally in 2019, the ICC Appeals Chamber stated clearly that no such immunity existed in relation to cases before international tribunals, especially the ICC.\n\nThus, the immediate problem for Israeli officials under any ICC arrest warrant would be that the court's 124 member states would be under a legal obligation to arrest such officials if they traveled to any of those 124 countries. That obligation should not be underestimated -- just last year, Putin canceled his plans to attend the BRICS summit in South Africa, in the apparent light of Pretoria's obligation to arrest him.", "source": {"uri": "foreignpolicy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Foreign Policy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rome Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War of aggression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crimes against humanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuremberg trials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert H.

Those under suspicion could include Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, members of his cabinet and generals in the Israel Defense Forces. The ICC has not said it is considering such a move. Yet Mr Netanyahu felt the threat serious enough to state on April 30th that any warrant \"would be an outrage of historic proportions\". The ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, warned that threats to \"retaliate\" against the court could undermine its impartiality. On what grounds would the ICC issue such warrants, and what would be the consequences?\n\nSeveral accusations of war crimes have been made against Israel during the war. The International Court of Justice, for instance, which is not connected to the ICC, has conducted inconclusive hearings on whether Israel is carrying out a genocide in Gaza. Unlike that court, the ICC deals with individuals rather than countries.\n\nThe list of those it has charged in its two-decade history is a 54-name-long litany of infamy. It includes Muammar Qaddafi, the Libyan tyrant for whom an arrest warrant was issued on charges of crimes against humanity five months before his death in November 2011; Omar al-Bashir, a former dictator of Sudan, indicted in 2009, but still \"at large\", as the ICC website puts it; and Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, for whom the ICC issued an arrest warrant in March 2023, for the illegal deportation of children from Ukraine.\n\nThe US senators that threatened ICC\n\nIt is not a list that Mr Netanyahu would want to join, even -- or perhaps especially -- if the ICC also indicts senior Hamas leaders, as seems likely. The perception of moral equivalence with Israel's foes would be hard for him to stomach.\n\nAs for the alleged crimes, Israeli legal officials suspect the ICC is investigating the obstruction of humanitarian supplies into Gaza, which international aid organizations claim has brought parts of the enclave to famine. The ICC could be considering an indictment on intentional starvation, a war crime. It might be partly based on the statements of some Israeli ministers, which suggested that Israel should impose a siege on Gaza and block all supplies to it in the wake of the October 7th attack.\n\nIsrael is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which gives the ICC its powers. The country would be unlikely to hand over its officials to stand trial. Still, the arrest warrants would \"make Israel an international pariah\", says one Israeli official. It would also make it very difficult for the individuals named to engage with their foreign counterparts. They would be liable for arrest when traveling abroad to the 124 countries that recognize the ICC's jurisdiction. Even America, which is not a signatory, would be reluctant to host them.\n\nSimply the threat of indictment can be powerful. Israeli officials privately link recent attempts to increase aid deliveries to Gaza to the fear of ICC warrants. That is also one reason Israel delayed for weeks the next phase of its ground attacks against the remaining Hamas stronghold in the city of Rafah. Still, on May 7th Israeli forces said they had taken control of the Rafah border crossing, a crucial route for aid into Gaza, as they continue the offensive.\n\nSome of Israel's supporters argue that an international court's intervention is unwarranted because the country has its own independent judiciary to hold the government to account. A petition from five human-rights organizations is currently being heard in Israel's high court, demanding that the government do more to allow supplies into Gaza. On May 3rd petitioners argued that the government was not fulfilling the aid commitments that it made in a previous hearing. If the government cannot abide by what it says in an Israeli court, its leaders may find themselves soon having to answer an international one.", "source": {"uri": "yalibnan.com", "dataType": "news",

Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson called for the Biden administration to \"immediately and unequivocally demand that the ICC stand down.\" Johnson went on to say that Congress would \"use every available tool to prevent such an abomination.\" Members of Congress from both parties said that warrants would be met with a strong response, and a letter from 12 Republican senators threatened Khan, promising that the US would \"sanction your employees and associates, and bar you and your families from the United States.\" \"You have been warned,\" the letter concluded ominously.\n\nAs the pressure mounted, the ICC prosecutor, British barrister Karim Khan, took to social media to issue his own warning. Threats of retaliation, he said, undermine the court's \"independence and impartiality.\" And, he noted, those who issue them could be charged by the ICC with the crime of obstructing justice.\n\nWhile the ICC has not confirmed the reports of impending charges -- which would almost certainly be coupled with warrants against top Hamas officials -- the furious diplomatic maneuverings are reflective of the unprecedented nature of any such event. The ICC has never, in over 21 years of existence, indicted a Western official. Indeed, no international tribunal since Nuremberg has done so. Up until now, the instruments of international justice have been used almost exclusively to address crimes by defeated adversaries, powerless outcasts, or opponents of the West such as Vladimir Putin or Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107.\n\nFor 15 years, since the Palestinian Authority submitted a declaration accepting the ICC's jurisdiction in January 2009, following Israel's Cast Lead operation, which killed more than 1,400 Gazans, Palestinian efforts to invoke the ICC have gotten the slow walk from three successive ICC prosecutors. Indeed, even after the indiscriminate and disproportionate Israeli response to the horrific Hamas attacks of October 7, many ICC-watchers believed that the savvy Khan was reluctant to cross a historic US red line with an indictment of Israeli officials, despite his increasingly strong warnings to both Hamas and Israel.\n\nIf that was in fact Khan's concern, it may have yielded to the relentless Israeli assault and the growing international consensus around the criminal nature of Israel's response, bolstered by the decision by the other court in The Hague, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which in response to a complaint by South Africa found that Israeli actions created a \"plausible\" risk of genocide. In March, Khan named Britain's former chief prosecutor, a Conservative Party member, to oversee his probe. Reporting by The New York Times suggests that an indictment would focus on Israel's obstruction of humanitarian aid, which Khan has emphasized in his public warnings and which would be relatively easy to demonstrate even without the ability to conduct an in-depth on-the-ground investigation. This would also be in line with the ICJ's emergency orders to Israel to facilitate such aid and an April statement by the UN's human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk that Israel's policies may \"amount to the use of starvation as a method of war, which is a war crime.\"\n\nIn response to the reports of possible warrants, the White House and State Department have insisted that the ICC has no jurisdiction over Israeli nationals because Israel is not state party to the ICC's governing Rome Statute (Palestine is a party). That pretension was roundly rejected in the 1998 Rome negotiations, however, which determined that the ICC could investigate and prosecute crimes committed by nationals of states party to the statute or on the territory of states that gave their consent. The Clinton administration, thus deprived of an iron-clad guarantee that no American (or Israeli) could ever be charged by the court, cast one of only seven votes against the Rome Statute.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, Washington imposed sanctions on previous prosecutor Fatou Bensouda for her timid investigations into Palestine and alleged US crimes in Afghanistan. Even in 2021, when the Biden administration lifted those sanctions, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, \"We maintain our longstanding objection to the Court's efforts to assert jurisdiction over personnel of non-States Parties such as the United States and Israel.\"\n\nThen, however, came the Russian invasion of Ukraine, massive Russian war crimes, the largest ICC investigation in history, and an arrest warrant against Putin. All of a sudden, the US did not care that the ICC was investigating nationals of a state not party to the statute (Russia). President Biden said the charges were justified, and Blinken urged ICC members to arrest Putin and his co-indictee Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia's commissioner for children's rights, who is accused of abducting thousands of Ukrainian kids, and turn them over to The Hague. Bipartisan legislation permitted Washington to support the ICC's Ukraine investigation. Now the United States may be hoist with its own petard -- something the Pentagon feared when it objected to providing the ICC with evidence against Russia.\n\nAn ICC warrant would make Netanyahu a wanted man, in the same category as Putin and Sudan's Omar al-Bashir. While it's unlikely that Netanyahu and the other indicted officials would be in handcuffs anytime soon, these crimes have no statute of limitations, meaning that once indicted, their world would be much smaller. And following on the heels of the ruling by the International Court of Justice, and the ICJ's decision in a later case brought by Nicaragua against Germany which reminded \"all States of their international obligations relating to the transfer of arms to parties to an armed conflict,\" to avoid such arms' being used to violate the Geneva and genocide Conventions, indictments of Netanyahu or other Israeli officials would make it untenable for the United States to claim that arming the Israeli military does not render it complicit in atrocities.", "source": {"uri": "thenation.com",

It warns against any attempts to intimidate or obstruct the court's proceedings, emphasizing the potential legal consequences for those who threaten or impede the administration of justice.\n\nThis stern rebuke from the ICC comes amid mounting tensions and escalating rhetoric from both sides.\n\nWithin Israel, there is a palpable sense of unease as the specter of ICC arrest warrants casts a shadow over domestic politics. (Related: ICC prosecutors interview hospital staff in Gaza to gather evidence of Israeli war crimes.)\n\nReports suggest that Netanyahu and other officials are feeling the strain of this unprecedented challenge to their authority. Netanyahu himself has personally condemned the ICC, claiming that it is an antisemitic organization. He has also appealed to world leaders and directly lobbied for President Joe Biden to intervene.\n\nThe Israeli government is keenly aware of the reputational damage and diplomatic fallout that could result from ICC action, particularly allegations of human rights violations, war crimes and genocide against members of the Israeli Defense Forces in Gaza.\n\nWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

Netanyahu recently spoke with Biden regarding the situation, and Israel is currently reviewing Hamas' acceptance of the brokered terms for a ceasefire.\n\nThe possibility of arrest warrants poses significant implications, as neither Israel nor the United States recognizes the ICC's jurisdiction. However, Israeli officials could face arrest in other countries, particularly in Europe, if warrants are issued.\n\nSuch warrants would also serve as a symbolic statement regarding Israel's actions in Gaza and could potentially embarrass Netanyahu on the international stage, aligning him with leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, who have faced similar ICC actions.\n\nIn response to these developments, Netanyahu has reiterated Israel's stance on self-defense, emphasizing that the country will not accept any attempts by the ICC to undermine its inherent right of self-defense.\n\nThe Israeli Foreign Ministry has also taken proactive measures by informing Israeli missions of the potential arrest warrants, expressing concerns that such actions could boost the morale of militant

Our country demonstrated in the American Service-Members' Protection Act the lengths to which we will go to protect that sovereignty.\"\n\nCalling such actions illegitimate and lacking legal basis, the senators wrote that Israel's ongoing assault on Gaza were part of \"legitimate actions of self-defense against their Iranian-backed aggressors. In fact, in your own words, you witnessed \"scenes of calculated cruelty\" conducted by Hamas in Israel following the October 7 attacks. These arrest warrants would align the ICC with the largest state sponsor of terrorism and its proxy. To be clear, there is no moral equivalence between Hamas's terrorism and Israel's justified response.\"\n\nFollowing Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, which left almost 1200 Israelis dead, Israel has been conducting an invasion of Gaza and the Israeli Defense Force has so far killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry.\n\n\"Issuing arrest warrants for the leaders of Israel would not only be unjustified, it would expose your organisation's hypocrisy and double standards. Your office has not issued arrest warrants for Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei or any other Iranian official, Syrian President Bashar al Assad or any other Syrian official, or Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh or any other Hamas official. Nor have you issued an arrest warrant for the genocidal General Secretary of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping, or any other Chinese official.\"\n\nThe letter also said that neither Israel nor the US are members of the ICC and are therefore outside its \"supposed jurisdiction\".\n\n\"The United States will not tolerate politicized attacks by the ICC on our allies.

It won't be put on the floor unless we have to,\" McCaul reportedly added.\n\nLast week, a bipartisan group of senators also held an online meeting with ICC officials to voice their concerns about the arrest warrants, as reported by Axios' Barak Ravid and Stephen Neukam.\n\nOn the other side, Khan responded last Friday calling for an end to the \"intimidation of its staff\", saying such threats could constitute an offense against the world's permanent war crimes court.\n\nIn the statement posted on social media platform X, the ICC prosecutor's office said all attempts to impede, intimidate or improperly influence its officials must cease immediately.\n\n\"The Office of the Prosecutor is aware that there is significant public interest in its investigations,\" the statement read, adding that \"the Office seeks to engage constructively with all stakeholders whenever such dialogue is consistent with its mandate under the Rome Statute to act independently and impartially\".\n\n'Unnaturally Afraid' - Netanyahu Worried ICC Could Issue Arrest Warrants\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed deep concern over the possibility of the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuing an arrest warrant for him and other high-ranking officials, according to Israeli media.\n\nThis comes amid Israeli media reports of the potential issuance of arrest warrants by the ICC against Netanyahu and other Israeli political and military leaders - such as Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Chief of Staff Herzl Halevi - for alleged violations of international law in the ongoing assault of the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Israeli newspaper Maariv cited unnamed sources as saying that Netanyahu is \"unnaturally afraid and worried\" about the prospect of facing an ICC arrest warrant in The Hague.\n\n'Absurd Position' - Russia Slams US Hypocrisy over ICC, Israel\n\nIn recent days, according to the report, Netanyahu has reached out to various international leaders and officials, including US President Joe Biden, in an effort to prevent the issuance of such a warrant.\n\nOn Friday, Netanyahu said any decisions made by the ICC will not affect Israel's actions, but would however \"set a dangerous precedent.\"\n\n\"Under my leadership, Israel will never accept any attempt by the ICC to undermine its inherent right of self-defense,\" he wrote on X.\n\nGaza Genocide\n\nCurrently on trial before the International Court of Justice for genocide against Palestinians, Israel has been waging a devastating war on Gaza since October 7.\n\nAccording to Gaza's Ministry of Health, 34,844 Palestinians have been killed, and 78,404 wounded in Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza starting on October 7.\n\nMoreover, at least 7,000 people are unaccounted for, presumed dead under the rubble of their homes throughout the Strip.\n\nPalestinian and international organizations say that the majority of those killed and wounded are women and children.\n\nThe Israeli war has resulted in an acute famine, mostly in northern Gaza, resulting in the death of many Palestinians, mostly children.\n\nThe Israeli aggression has also resulted in the forceful displacement of nearly two million people from all over the Gaza Strip, with the vast majority of the displaced forced into the densely crowded southern city of Rafah near the border with Egypt - in what has become Palestine's largest mass exodus since the 1948 Nakba.", "source": {"uri": "palestinechronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Palestine Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

In the Book of Samuel, God orders King Saul, \"Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys\".\n\nThe UN's top legal body, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled this January that Israel could be investigated on \"plausible\" charges of violating the Genocide Convention. (The ICJ and ICC are separate institutions, although both are located at the Hague.)\n\nAmnesty International and Human Rights Watch have stated that Israel is violating this ICJ ruling that demands that it abide by the Genocide Convention.\n\nTop UN experts have publicly warned that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.\n\nIn addition to bombing civilian areas and killing tens of thousands of innocent men, women, and children, Israel has used hunger as a weapon, starving Palestinian civilians.\n\nThe US director of the UN World Food Program warned that Gaza is now suffering from a \"full-blown famine\", after seven months of a suffocating Israeli blockade.\n\nThe US government has provided the vast majority of the weapons that Israel is using to bomb civilian areas in Gaza. If Israeli officials face charges over their war crimes, Washington would be complicit.\n\nOn April 24, a dozen Republican senators sent a threatening letter to the ICC prosecutor. The media outlet Zeteo obtained the document.\n\nThe missive was signed by major GOP leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Tom Cotton.\n\nIn the aggressively worded letter, the senators pledged to \"sanction your employees and associates, and bar you and your families from the United States\" if Israeli officials face charges over their war crimes in Gaza.\n\n\"Target Israel and we will target you\", they threatened.\n\nIssuing an arrest warrant for Netanyahu or other top officials would be seen \"not only as a threat to Israel's sovereignty but to the sovereignty of the United States\", the US politicians wrote, making it clear that they see Israel as a key part of the US empire.\n\n\"Our country demonstrated in the American Service-Members' Protection Act the lengths to which we will go to protect that sovereignty\", they added.\n\nThe American Service-Members' Protection Act is popularly known as the \"Hague Invasion Act\". The legislation was signed into law in 2002 by President George W. Bush.\n\nHuman Rights Watch explained that this law \"authorizes the use of military force to liberate any American or citizen of a U.S.-allied country being held by the court\".\n\nBy invoking the Hague Invasion Act in their 2024 letter to the ICC prosecutor, the Republican senators made it clear that the two-decade-old legislation is still valid: hawks in Washington are willing to invade the Hague to save Israeli officials if they are prosecuted.\n\nIt is not just Republicans who are threatening the ICC. This is bipartisan in Washington.\n\nThe Israeli press reported that, behind the scenes, the Joe Biden administration is also aggressively pressuring the ICC not to issue arrest warrants for Israeli officials.\n\nIn 2020, when Donald Trump was in the White House, the ICC opened an investigation into war crimes committed in the war in Afghanistan. The US and NATO forces were included in this inquiry.\n\nIn anger, the US government imposed sanctions on the Hague. Trump administration officials even threatened family members of ICC staff.\n\nWhen Biden came into power in 2021, he sought to differentiate himself from his Republican predecessor. Secretary of State Antony Blinken publicly announced the end of the Trump-era sanctions and visa restrictions against ICC personnel.\n\nHowever, despite the Democratic administration's claims to support the so-called \"rules-based international order\", the Biden White House is now also intimidating ICC staff - if only a bit more quietly and less extravagantly than Trump and the Republicans have done.\n\nThe Biden administration furiously opposes any efforts to hold Israeli officials responsible for the war crimes they have committed in Gaza, with US weapons and political support.\n\nThis demonstrates Washington's glaring double standards, as Biden himself had praised the ICC for issuing an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2023.\n\nSecretary of State Blinken urged ICC member states to arrest Putin if he entered their territory. But a year later, he is aggressively pressuring the ICC to stop it from charging Israeli officials.\n\nIronically, it was the US and Israel who had lobbied for the election of Karim Khan as ICC prosecutor.\n\nThis is despite the fact that the US and Israel are not state parties to the Rome Statute, and therefore are not members of the ICC.\n\nUS and Israeli lobbying paid off. In 2021, Khan entered office as ICC prosecutor, and immediately dropped the investigation into war crimes committed by US and NATO forces in Afghanistan.\n\nBut today, seven months into Israel's brutal war on Gaza, the ICC is facing global condemnation for its inaction in the face of what UN experts say is clearly a genocide.\n\nGlobal South leaders have long denounced the ICC as a colonial institution. Until 2016, only Africans had been tried for the worst crimes at the Court.\n\nKhan is being forced to act, if he hopes to save face and salvage the legitimacy of the ICC. But his former sponsors in the US and Israel have turned against him.\n\nIt is not just justice for the Palestinian people, but the reputation of the International Criminal Court itself that is at stake.", "source": {"uri": "scheerpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "scheerpost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalek", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., in February 2023.\n\nThis legislation, brought by Reps. Brian Mast, R-Fla., Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., would \"sanction any individual working to investigate, arrest, detain or prosecute American citizens or an official from an allied U.S. country, including Israel.\"\n\n\"Our legislation sends a clear message to the International Criminal Court,\" Mast said in a press release. \"We may not recognize you, but you sure as hell will recognize what happens when you target America or its allies.\"\n\nThe bill comes days after the ICC pushed back on \"threats\" it perceived coming from the U.S. and Israel. It also comes after reports that a bipartisan group of senators met with senior ICC officials over its investigation into Israel. It also comes a day after the revelation that a dozen GOP senators sent a letter to ICC top prosecutor Karim Khan on April 24.\n\n\"These arrest warrants would align the ICC with the largest state sponsor of terrorism and its proxy. To be clear, there is no moral equivalence between Hamas's terrorism and Israel's justified response,\" the senators wrote, concluding, \"You have been warned.\"\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, framed Tuesday's legislation as \"sort of a precaution\" in the event the ICC moves forward with international arrest warrants.\n\n\"We want to emphasize to him that going down this road of arrest warrants is a really bad idea and it's going to blow up the relationship,\" McCaul told Axios.\n\nKhan said he opened an investigation in March 2021 regarding war crimes committed by Israel and terrorists in the 2014 Israel-Hamas war. The ICC said its probe extended \"to the escalation of hostilities and violence\" in the aftermath of Oct. 7, when Hamas terrorists slaughtered more than 1,200 Israeli citizens, including women, children, and infants.\n\nIsrael has told the United States that the Palestinian Authority (PA) is pressing the ICC to bring arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Israel Defense Forces chief of staff Herzi Halevi.\n\n\"The International Criminal Court's threats to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and other Israeli Defense officials expose a campaign to undermine the only democracy in the Middle East, while turning a blind eye to the numerous human right atrocities committed by Hamas,\" Stefanik said in the release. \"The ICC is on notice; if they move forward with these illegitimate warrants, the international bureaucrats involved will face consequences.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden has publicly declared he opposes the ICC's

Said investigation has been extended to the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and the war that has been raging in Gaza since then, according to the prosecutor's office.\n\nTwo Israeli officials reportedly said that Israel recently told the U.S. that it has information suggesting Palestinian Authority officials are pressing the ICC prosecutor to issue arrest warrants against Israeli leaders, namely Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Israel Defense Forces chief of staff Herzi Halevi. Israel expressed that it will consider the Palestinian Authority (PA) responsible and retaliate with strong action that could lead to its collapse.\n\nThe sources, meanwhile, told Axios that the Biden administration has told ICC officials in private that \"arrest warrants against Israeli leaders would be a mistake. White House assured them that the U.S. doesn't support the action.\"\n\n\"We are quietly encouraging the ICC not to do it. It will blow up everything. Israel will retaliate against the Palestinian Authority,\" a U.S. official said. One such action that Israel warned about is freezing the transfer of tax revenues Israel collects for the PA. Without these funds, the PA would be bankrupt.\n\nWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

Every purchase at HealthRangerStore.com helps fund our efforts to build and share more tools for empowering humanity with knowledge and abundance.\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli media has reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is \"frightened and unusually stressed\" by the prospect of being issued with an arrest warrant. He was reported to have been acting like \"an elephant in a China shop,\" hammering the phones and seeking to put pressure on the ICC by any means necessary.\n\nIn a televised speech for the opening ceremony of Holocaust Remembrance Day on Sunday, the prime minister said the ICC was \"founded as a consequence of the Holocaust\" and should not attempt to undermine Israel's fundamental right to self-defense. Any arrests would restrict Israel's ability to defend itself, calling it a \"distortion of justice and history,\" he argued. \"Even if Israel is forced to stand alone, we will stand alone, and we will continue to strike our enemies powerfully until victory. Even if we have to stand alone, we will continue to fight human evil,\" Netanyahu added.\n\nIsrael is not a member of the ICC and rejects the court's jurisdiction. That has not previously stopped the court from investigating its actions in the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nAmid its probe into war crimes being committed in Gaza, the prosecutor's office at the ICC has revealed it was experiencing threats. And so it appealed for an end to what it calls intimidation of its staff, saying such threats could constitute an offense against the \"administration of justice\" by the world's permanent war crimes court.\n\nThe Hague-based office of ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan did not mention Israel but the office's statement was issued after Israeli and U.S. officials warned of consequences against the ICC if it issues arrest warrants over Israel's war on Gaza. \"The Office seeks to engage constructively with all stakeholders whenever such dialogue is consistent with its mandate under the Rome Statute to act independently and impartially,\" it said. \"That independence and impartiality is undermined, however, when individuals threaten to retaliate against the Court or against Court personnel should the Office, in fulfillment of its mandate, make decisions about investigations or cases falling within its jurisdiction.\" It added that the Rome Statute, which outlines the ICC's structure and areas of jurisdiction, prohibits threats against the court and its officials.\n\nThe international court is empowered to prosecute individuals for alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Since the Israeli military has killed nearly 35,000 people in Gaza and destroyed large parts of the territory since the start of the war on Oct. 7, the ICC proceeded to try the case.\n\nMeanwhile, White House spokesman John Kirby was asked during a briefing about threats by Republican lawmakers to pass legislation against the ICC. According to Kirby, the U.S. is opposed to an ICC investigation against Israel but stressed it is also opposed to threats and intimidations against the court's judges. This alarmed Israeli officials and they asked the White House whether it represents a change in the U.S. position. The White House said there has been no change, Axios reported.

The issue is potentially problematic for the Biden administration, which backed the ICC's decision last year to serve an arrest warrant to Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine despite neither Washington nor Moscow being formally affiliated with the international body.\n\n\"On Russia, there was a total consensus against Russian aggression and when you read the speech by the Americans at the Security Council, they were furious with [Russia] blocking the consensus to protect the law,\" Luis Moreno-Ocampo, who served as the first prosecutor to the ICC, told Newsweek.\n\n\"Now it's the U.S. which is blocking the consensus to apply the law,\" he added, \"and that is a problem.\"\n\nMoreno-Ocampo, who successfully prosecuted three heads of state during his nine-year tenure, said that he had evaluated opening cases on Israel but was twice asked by U.S. officials to halt the effort. And while he noted that the ICC should also move forward with investigations into reports of Hamas committing atrocities during the October 7 attack that sparked the conflict, he argued that any efforts to pressure international courts served as an impediment to global justice.\n\n\"We should not accept that the government says you cannot prosecute this individual because he is my friend. That is not what the world needs. No, I think it's a problem,\" Moreno-Ocampo said. \"I think it is a serious problem because the U.S. policy is to protect its friends.\"\n\nComplex Relationship\n\nWashington's relationship with the ICC is complicated and has undergone several phases.\n\nThe U.S. was one of only seven countries -- along with China, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Qatar and Yemen -- to vote against the United Nations Security Council resolution to establish an international criminal court in 1998. Then-President Bill Clinton signed on to the Rome Statute that would serve as the basis for the ICC mandate in 2000, but the signature was never ratified and, his successor, former President George W. Bush, informed the U.N. that the U.S. had no intentions of joining the court.\n\nTies improved later in the Bush administration and throughout the tenure of former President Barack Obama, who sought active engagement with the ICC, even as he officially opposed the Palestinian National Authority's decision to join the Rome Statute given that the U.S. does not recognize Palestinian statehood in its current form.\n\n\"President Obama officially said the U.S. strategy is to support the ICC cases that the U.S. likes,\" Moreno-Ocampo said. \"So, the U.S. is not believing in impartiality. The U.S. believes in justice against my enemies. That's it.\"\n\n\"The U.S. Congress applauded when the Security Council sent the Libya case to the ICC or in Darfur, in Uganda, so it depends on the case,\" he added. \"Of course, when you do cases against enemies, the U.S. will be happy. But that's why the prosecutor is independent.\"\n\nThe White House's wrath was on full display under the former President Donald Trump, whose administration pursued punitive measures against ICC personnel, including visa withdrawals and sanctions, after a case was opened over potential U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan. The case was eventually dropped in 2021 and sanctions were lifted by President Joe Biden.\n\nThough the Biden administration remained openly opposed to any efforts to prosecute Israel, the current U.S. leader ultimately supported the ICC investigation into Putin after attempting to set up a separate domestic court to oversee the proceedings in Ukraine. The Biden administration later made the historic decision last year to collaborate actively in providing evidence to the ICC on the issue.\n\nNow, however, the U.S. policy toward the ICC, which currently counts 124 Rome Statute parties, has once again been put to the test as Netanyahu faces potential prosecution over the war in Gaza.\n\nWarnings to the Court\n\nFrictions have emerged between the U.S. and Israel over the White House's repeated calls for Netanyahu to do more to avoid civilian casualties and expand humanitarian assistance, but U.S. officials have asserted that they were against Israel being put before the ICC.\n\n\"The crux of this for the United States is that we do not believe that the ICC has jurisdiction on this,\" State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters last week. \"That being said, we work closely with the ICC on a number of key areas. We think that they do important work -- important work as it relates to Ukraine, Darfur, Sudan. But again, in this particular instance, I'm sorry, they just do not have jurisdiction.\"\n\nState Department spokesperson Matthew Miller reiterated the point on Monday, saying, \"We have made clear that we do not believe the ICC has jurisdiction in this case and oppose their investigation.\"\n\nConservative members of Congress have weighed in as well. A letter from a group of Republican lawmakers, led by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, sent to ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan last month asserted that \"such actions are illegitimate and lack legal basis, and if carried out will result in severe sanctions against you and your institution.\" It warned, \"Target Israel and we will target you.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also expressed U.S. opposition to the ICC investigation into Israel during a press briefing last week. At the same time, she said the Biden administration has been \"very clear about opposing any type of a threats or attempts to intimidate\" public officials, \"including ICC officials.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the ICC and the White House for comment.\n\nIn his latest comments on the ICC, Netanyahu argued in a video address delivered Monday on Holocaust Remembrance Day that it would be an \"indelible stain\" for a court \"founded as a consequence of the Holocaust\" to pursue charges against Israeli leadership amid the ongoing conflict with Hamas. In earlier remarks issued last week, he argued that such an investigation would amount to a \"historic scandal\" and an \"unprecedented anti-Semitic hate crime.\"\n\n\"Branding Israel's leaders and soldiers as war criminals will pour jet fuel on the fires of anti-Semitism, those fires that are already raging on America's campuses and in capitals all around the world,\" Netanyahu said at the time. \"It will also be the first time that a democratic country fighting for its life according to the rules of war is itself accused of war crimes.\"\n\n\"The Israeli army, the IDF, is one of the most moral militaries in the world, it takes endless measures to prevent civilian casualties, measures no other army takes,\" the Israeli leader added. \"It does so while fighting a terrorist enemy which uses its own civilians as human shields.\"\n\nReached for comment on the ICC investigation and potential U.S. actions to obstruct it, a spokesperson for Netanyahu's office told Newsweek: \"We expect all necessary measures applicable to the law be taken to prevent this absurdity.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the ICC told Newsweek that \"the ICC Office of the Prosecutor has a current and ongoing investigation in relation to the Situation in the State of Palestine\" and noted that Khan \"has addressed the situation in various public remarks and also in official statements at the ICC Assembly of States Parties.\"\n\nAt the same time, the spokesperson said that Khan \"has also underlined that the Office does not give a running commentary in relation to ongoing investigations, nor does the Office respond to speculation in media reports.\"\n\nWhile the ICC has not formally responded to any comments regarding the reported investigation into Israel, Khan's office issued a statement on Saturday emphasizing the duty of the court \"to act independently and impartially\" and warning that such values \"are undermined, however, when individuals threaten to retaliate against the Court or against Court personnel should the Office, in fulfilment of its mandate, make decisions about investigations or cases falling within its jurisdiction.\"\n\n\"The Office insists that all attempts to impede, intimidate or improperly influence its officials cease immediately,\" the statement said.\n\nOvercoming Accusations of Bias\n\nIt's not the first time the ICC has been accused of undue bias. The vast majority of individuals indicted by the court have been from Africa and critics have long argued that the ICC remained too focused on one continent while not putting sufficient resources to prosecuting alleged war crimes taking place elsewhere in the world.\n\nNoting both Netanyahu's line of argument and those put forth by others subject to ICC scrutiny, Chile Eboe-Osuji, a former president of the ICC, told Newsweek that \"it has become routine for persons subjected to scrutiny at the ICC to throw such straws at the ICC in desperation.\"\n\nHe recalled arguments by past targets from African countries such as Kenyan officials and former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, all of whom Eboe-Osuji said engaged in \"a sustained campaign calling the Court 'racist' and a 'neo-colonialist' tool that Western powers were using to harass African leaders.\"\n\n\"As an African, I disagreed with such characterizations, and I defended the Court. The Court proceeded with its processes undeterred by those allegations,\" Eboe-Osuji said. \"We see the same thing happening here. I disagree with the 'antisemite' allegation.\"\n\n\"Antisemitism is an abhorrent conduct that the whole world must stand on guard against. It has done real harm to our shared humanity,\" he added. \"But we want that allegation to have meaning. Using it reflexively at every turn to deflect criticism of the conduct of the individuals who exercise political power in Israel comes with an unfortunate danger of wearing thin the treads to that serious misanthropy that needs to be confronted whenever there is a real incident of it.\"\n\nAs to concerns that the ICC may be unfairly targeting Israel over Hamas, Eboe-Osuji said he expected that the Palestinian movement would also be subject to investigation.\n\n\"The trouble of course is that the Israeli government has vowed to kill all the Hamas militants implicated in that attack,\" the former ICC president said. \"The thing with that is this: it may mean that the IDF might leave Karim Khan no Hamas operatives to prosecute at the ICC.\"\n\n\"Even so,\" he added, \"the present allegation of antisemitism against the ICC cannot be taken seriously by anyone except those who chose to make it in the vain hope that it might stop any ICC process in its tracks.\"\n\nWhat Case Could Look Like\n\nWhile it remains uncertain exactly how the ICC may pursue its investigations into Israel, Moreno-Ocampo offered some potential hints in Khan's language that point to four areas of investigation.\n\nThe first two pertain directly to the IDF's actions in Gaza. They include allegations of putting the densely populated Palestinian territory under siege, which would amount to a war crime if Israel was found to be deliberately denying crucial goods such as food and medicine to residents, and intentionally bombing protected sites, such as mosques and hospitals, which the IDF has alleged are used by Hamas to store weapons and conduct attacks.\n\nThe third area involves Hamas' role in planning and conducting the October 7 attacks, during which Israeli officials have argued that the group, alongside other Palestinian factions, specifically targeted civilians to murder, sexually assault and kidnap. Moreno-Ocampo noted that the ICC's capacity to investigate such acts committed on Israeli soil is limited due to Israel's lack of cooperation with the court, but the ICC could go after Hamas' financial networks abroad.\n\nFinally, a fourth area of potential investigation would be the Israeli government's policy toward settlers that have been accused of attacking Palestinians in the West Bank throughout the course of the conflict in Gaza.\n\n\"These are the four investigations probably open,\" Moreno-Ocampo said. \"Where they are depends on the evidence connected.\"\n\nAs for how the case proceeds, Moreno-Ocampo said the next step would be to provide evidence to the pre-trial chamber whose judges would decide whether there was sufficient material to bring about a case. This could either directly result in a warrant being issued, or, as Moreno-Ocampo noted, the prosecutor could invite the concerned parties -- Israeli and Hamas leaders -- to appear at The Hague to discuss the case.\n\n'Nobody Is Above the Law'\n\nShould a decision be made by the ICC to issue an arrest warrant, Eboe-Osuji emphasized that such a move \"would have come only at the end of what is already a very long rope.\"\n\n\"It will be recalled that right at the beginning of the war, Karim Khan had put both sides on notice that he would be investigating how the war is being fought,\" Eboe-Osuji said. \"Right from the beginning, every high official in the UN system, from the Secretary-General down, was decrying the indiscriminate nature of the bombings that were killing civilians in record numbers in modern history, accompanied by dangerous rhetoric openly indicating intent to starve the population.\"\n\nHe also noted statements of concern issued by the leaders of Western nations, including Canada, France and Ireland, and even Biden.\n\n\"Even he has repeatedly been on record chastising the Israeli military operation in Gaza -- describing the operation as entailing 'indiscriminate' killing of Palestinians,\" Eboe-Osuji said. \"And Prime Minister Netanyahu has been keen to strike a public pose that pushes away Biden's concerns, demanding only that Biden give him weapons to use as he sees fit.\"\n\n\"It is truly difficult to imagine anyone else who for so long would have escaped the ICC spotlight in light of evidence of similar conduct as we've seen in Gaza,\" he added. \"Not even U.S. operatives were able to escape it for far less serious allegations in Afghanistan.\"\n\nNow, with Netanyahu declaring that a planned offensive into Rafah would move forward despite the Biden administration's protests, the former ICC president argued that the international court's current prosecutor may have little choice but to take the case public and that the U.S. leader's options to respond may be limited as well.\n\n\"I would expect that an onslaught on Rafah which results in further eyesore of more bloodshed of civilian life and destruction of civilian infrastructure -- a prospect which Biden has drawn a 'red line' against -- will immediately force Karim Khan's hand,\" Eboe-Osuji said.\n\n\"In light of the foregoing, and given that Biden had communicated his agreement with the ICC arrest warrant issued against President Putin,\" he added, \"it would be difficult to see any justifiable legal basis on which Biden would disagree with subjecting Israeli leadership to the assessment of their conduct in Gaza against the yardstick of international law assessed by impartial judges.\"\n\nEboe-Osuji also cited the words of another Western leader, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who, after the ICC arrest warrant for Putin was issued last year, declared that \"nobody is above the law.\"\n\n\"The Chancellor is correct,\" Eboe-Osuji said. \"The question in every case must be whether these arrest warrants are based on principles of law against which the conduct of people can be measured for correctness. If, yes, then then no one should be above having his or her conduct measured against those principles of law. It is as simple as that.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_o_connor@newsweek.com", "name": "Tom O'Connor", "type": "author",

The Biden administration is also pressuring the ICC not to charge Israeli officials over their war crimes in Gaza.\n\nUS government officials have threatened the International Criminal Court (ICC) at the Hague, telling its Prosecutor Karim Khan that if he issues arrest warrants against Israeli officials over their war crimes in Gaza, the US government could impose sanctions on him, other ICC personnel, and their family members.\n\nUS senators even threatened to invade the Hague if it tries to prosecute Israeli officials.\n\nUN experts: Israel is committing genocide in Gaza\n\nThis April, Israel's extreme-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a prominent member of the state security cabinet, called for \"total annihilation\" of Gaza.\n\nSmotrich cited the Biblical nation of Amalek - a genocidal reference also made by far-right Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThese invocations of Amalek are clear calls for genocide. In the Book of Samuel, God orders King Saul, \"Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys\".\n\nThe UN's top legal body, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled this January that Israel could be investigated on \"plausible\" charges of violating the Genocide Convention. (The ICJ and ICC are separate institutions, although both are located at the Hague.)\n\nAmnesty International and Human Rights Watch have stated that Israel is violating this ICJ ruling that demands that it abide by the Genocide Convention.\n\nTop UN experts have publicly warned that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.\n\nIn addition to bombing civilian areas and killing tens of thousands of innocent men, women, and children, Israel has used hunger as a weapon, starving Palestinian civilians.\n\nThe US director of the UN World Food Program warned that Gaza is now suffering from a \"full-blown famine\", after seven months of a suffocating Israeli blockade.\n\nThe US government has provided the vast majority of the weapons that Israel is using to bomb civilian areas in Gaza. If Israeli officials face charges over their war crimes, Washington would be complicit.\n\nInternational Criminal Court Prosecutors Interview Gaza Hospital Staff Over Israeli War Crimes\n\nUS senators threaten to sanction and invade the ICC\n\nOn April 24, a dozen Republican senators sent a threatening letter to the ICC prosecutor. The media outlet Zeteo obtained the document.\n\nThe missive was signed by major GOP leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Tom Cotton.\n\nIn the aggressively worded letter, the senators pledged to \"sanction your employees and associates, and bar you and your families from the United States\" if Israeli officials face charges over their war crimes in Gaza.\n\n\"Target Israel and we will target you\", they threatened.\n\nIssuing an arrest warrant for Netanyahu or other top officials would be seen \"not only as a threat to Israel's sovereignty but to the sovereignty of the United States\", the US politicians wrote, making it clear that they see Israel as a key part of the US empire.\n\n\"Our country demonstrated in the American Service-Members' Protection Act the lengths to which we will go to protect that sovereignty\", they added.\n\nThe American Service-Members' Protection Act is popularly known as the \"Hague Invasion Act\". The legislation was signed into law in 2002 by President George W. Bush.\n\nHuman Rights Watch explained that this law \"authorizes the use of military force to liberate any American or citizen of a U.S.-allied country being held by the court\".\n\nBy invoking the Hague Invasion Act in their 2024 letter to the ICC prosecutor, the Republican senators made it clear that the two-decade-old legislation is still valid: hawks in Washington are willing to invade the Hague to save Israeli officials if they are prosecuted.\n\nBiden administration double standards on the ICC\n\nIt is not just Republicans who are threatening the ICC. This is bipartisan in Washington.\n\nThe Israeli press reported that, behind the scenes, the Joe Biden administration is also aggressively pressuring the ICC not to issue arrest warrants for Israeli officials.\n\nIn 2020, when Donald Trump was in the White House, the ICC opened an investigation into war crimes committed in the war in Afghanistan. The US and NATO forces were included in this inquiry.\n\nIn anger, the US government imposed sanctions on the Hague. Trump administration officials even threatened family members of ICC staff.\n\nWhen Biden came into power in 2021, he sought to differentiate himself from his Republican predecessor. Secretary of State Antony Blinken publicly announced the end of the Trump-era sanctions and visa restrictions against ICC personnel.\n\nHowever, despite the Democratic administration's claims to support the so-called \"rules-based international order\", the Biden White House is now also intimidating ICC staff - if only a bit more quietly and less extravagantly than Trump and the Republicans have done.\n\nThe Biden administration furiously opposes any efforts to hold Israeli officials responsible for the war crimes they have committed in Gaza, with US weapons and political support.\n\nThis demonstrates Washington's glaring double standards, as Biden himself had praised the ICC for issuing an arrest warrant for RussianPresident Vladimir Putin in 2023.\n\nSecretary of State Blinken urged ICC member states to arrest Putin if he entered their territory. But a year later, he is aggressively pressuring the ICC to stop it from charging Israeli officials.\n\nUS and Israel supported Karim Khan as ICC prosecutor\n\nIronically, it was the US and Israel who had lobbied for the election of Karim Khan as ICC prosecutor.\n\nThis is despite the fact that the US and Israel are not state parties to the Rome Statute, and therefore are not members of the ICC.\n\nUS and Israeli lobbying paid off. In 2021, Khan entered office as ICC prosecutor, and immediately dropped the investigation into war crimes committed by US and NATO forces in Afghanistan.\n\nBut today, seven months into Israel's brutal war on Gaza, the ICC is facing global condemnation for its inaction in the face of what UN experts say is clearly a genocide.\n\nGlobal South leaders have long denounced the ICC as a colonial institution. Until 2016, only Africans had been tried for the worst crimes at the Court.\n\nKhan is being forced to act, if he hopes to save face and salvage the legitimacy of the ICC. But his former sponsors in the US and Israel have turned against him.\n\nIt is not just justice for the Palestinian people, but the reputation of the International Criminal Court itself that is at stake.\n\n(Geopolitical Economy Report)\n\nfrom https://orinocotribune.com/us-politicians-threaten-to-invade-intl-criminal-court-if-israel-faces-war-crimes-charges/", "source": {"uri":

This would be a violation of the Rome Statute, the treaty that governs the ICC, and it would represent an immediate threat to U.S. officials and service members. Washington's response should be harsh and swift.\n\nThe U.S. and Israel, two liberal democracies with strong legal mechanisms to hold their governments and militaries accountable, aren't ICC members. The Rome Statute is quite clear: Investigating either country is out of bounds. The ICC has an open investigation of the U.S. military, which the court placed on hold in 2021. If the ICC is allowed to indict Israeli officials, Americans will be next.\n\nICC members that legitimize such investigations or honor illegitimate arrest warrants are conducting lawfare against democracies. The ICC as an institution and collaborating member states must be held accountable.\n\nIn 2021 President Biden rescinded his predecessor's executive order that threatened sanctions against anyone involved in an ICC investigation, arrest, detention or prosecution of an American or a nonconsenting ally like Israel. Mr. Biden thought an olive branch would keep the court within its jurisdictional bounds. He was wrong.\n\nIf the ICC issues a warrant for an American or Israeli, these sanctions must return with even greater scope -- seizing assets and denying visas for ICC officials involved, and mandating financial sanctions against any bank that processes a transaction for the ICC.

Tom Cotton (R-AR) that would sanction the International Criminal Court if it issues arrest warrants against Israel officials over Israel's war effort against Hamas.\n\nAccording to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul (R-TX), the House is preparing a companion bill. The Biden administration revoked a Trump administration executive order that would have held the ICC accountable for such behavior.\n\nOn April 29, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) released a statement in which he said:\n\nIt is disgraceful that the International Criminal Court (ICC) is reportedly planning to issue baseless and illegitimate arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials. Such a lawless action by the ICC would directly undermine U.S. national security interests. If unchallenged by the Biden administration, the ICC could create and assume unprecedented power to issue arrest warrants against American political leaders, American diplomats, and American military personnel, thereby endangering our country's sovereign authority. Instead of wrongly targeting Israel, the ICC should pursue charges against Iran and its terror proxies, including Hamas, for engaging in horrific war crimes. The Biden Administration must immediately and unequivocally demand that the ICC stand down and the U.S. should use every available tool to prevent such an abomination.\n\nIn early February, Cotton introduced a bill with Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) to sanction officials and associates of the International Criminal Court (ICC) who investigate or prosecute U.S. troops and officials and allies who do not recognize the authority of the ICC, such as Israel.\n\nOn April 24, Cotton and 10 other GOP senators sent a letter to the ICC warning them that if they issued international arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials, \"We will move to end all American support for the ICC, sanction your employees and associates, and bar you and your families from the United States.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nThe letter noted, \"Issuing arrest warrants for the leaders of Israel would not only be unjustified, it would expose your organization's hypocrisy and double standards.

It won't be put on the floor unless we have to,\" he added.\n\nMcCaul emphasized the new package would come as a \"companion\" to legislation introduced last February in the Senate that seeks to sanction ICC officials \"involved in probes of US allies who are not ICC members, such as Israel.\"\n\nThe report by Axios comes on the heels of a harshly worded letter sent by a group of Republican senators to Khan, warning him against prosecuting Israeli officials for alleged genocide in Gaza.\n\n\"Target Israel and we will target you,\" the senators tell Khan, adding that they will \"sanction your employees and associates, and bar you and your families from the United States.\"\n\nThe letter, a copy of which was obtained by the Zeteo website, concludes: \"You have been warned.\" It contains the signatures of 12 Republican senators, including Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz.\n\nNeither Washington nor Tel Aviv are among the 124 states that remain signatories of the ICC Rome Statute of 1998. Nevertheless, the occupied Palestinian territories were admitted to the court with the status of a member state in April 2015.\n\nUS officials have been scrambling to protect Israeli authorities from war crimes prosecution ever since reports revealed the ICC was looking into the atrocities committed in Gaza.\n\nLast week, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers threatened the ICC with \"retaliation\" following a virtual meeting in which they expressed their \"concerns\" to court officials.

Various elements have gone into its creation. As with any international institution which draws its legitimacy from nation states and the like, its detractors are many, the invective against it frequent. Some 124 countries have signed the Rome Charter of 1998 that gives the body its authority and jurisdictional force, but no one is foolish enough to think that its reach can ever be anything but tempered by political consideration and self-interest.\n\nBe it issuing a problematic arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, attempting to investigate alleged US war crimes in Afghanistan, or busying itself with some nasty examples of African despotism, the scope of the body is potentially extensive. At present, ICC prosecutor Karim Khan is sniffing out the prospect of issuing arrest warrants against senior Israeli officials in the context of the war in Gaza. The sniff, however, has come with a rebuking blast from Israel, joined by various politicians in the United States champing at the bit to take a swipe at the body.\n\nSuch attacks have only been emboldened by the American Service-Members' Protection Act, an instrument from 2002 that prohibits federal, state and local governments from furnishing the ICC with assistance in any way while authorising the US president \"to use all means necessary and appropriate to bring about the release\" of any \"US person\" or \"allied persons\" detained or imprisoned by, on behalf of, or at the request,\" of the ICC.\n\nIn what is expedient and legally anomalous, Washington has chosen not only to avoid signing the Rome Statute but reject ICC jurisdiction over the Palestinian territories. The ICC begs to differ, noting the acceptance of the court's jurisdiction on the part of \"the Government of Palestine\" and its accession to the Rome Statute in January 2015.\n\nIn late October 2023, Israel announced that it would not be permitting Khan to enter Israel, signalling its intention to frustrate, as far as possible, his investigative functions. In April this year, Axios revealed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had requested US President Joe Biden to prevent the ICC from issuing arrest warrants against senior Israeli officials. A broader lobbying effort of the US Congress by the Netanyahu government is also taking place.\n\nOn May 1, a bipartisan group of US senators held a virtual meeting with members of seniority from the ICC, worried about the prospect that arrest warrants for top Israel might issue from the prosecutorial pipeline. In a threatening letter to Khan from a dozen Republican senators led by Tom Cotton, the promise for retaliation was unequivocal:\n\n\"Target Israel, and we will target you.\"\n\nIssuing such warrants would be \"illegitimate and lack legal basis, and, if carried out, will result in severe actions against you and your institution.\" They would \"not only be a threat to Israel's sovereignty but to the sovereignty of the United States.\"\n\nThis was hardly novel and was unlikely to have phased Khan or his staff. In June 2020, President Donald Trump implemented an executive order directed at the ICC. The order authorised the blocking of assets and imposed family entry bans into the US in response to the court's efforts to investigate the alleged commission of war crimes in Afghanistan by US personnel. In September that year, pursuant to the executive order, targeted sanctions were imposed on then ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and senior prosecution official Phakiso Mochochoko.\n\nSince 2021, the ICC has been vested in examining alleged war crimes committed by both the Israeli Defense Forces and Palestinian militants stretching back to the 2014 Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Upon the commencement of my mandate in June 2021,\" Khan states, \"I put in place for the first time a dedicated team to advance the investigation in relation to the Situation in the State of Palestine.\"\n\nIts mission is to collect, preserve and analyse \"information and communications from key stakeholders in relation to relevant incidents.\"\n\nIn November 2023, the office of the prosecutor received a referral from South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros and Djibouti to investigate \"the Situation in the State of Palestine.\" The referral requests the prosecutor \"to vigorously investigate crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court allegedly committed\" on various grounds, including, among others, the unlawful appropriation and destruction of private and public properties, the forcible transfer of Palestinians, the unlawful transfer of Israel's population into Occupied Palestinian Territory and a discriminatory system amounting to apartheid.\n\nThe spectacularly brutal Israeli campaign in Gaza following the October 7 attacks by Hamas also enlivened interest in using the ICC's jurisdiction to investigate allegations of genocide, crimes against humanity and relevant war crimes. But the notable catch, and bound to be threatening to its intended targets, was the request that culprits be found, and perpetrators be outed and held accountable. South Africa, more specifically, requested that the prosecutor \"investigate the Situation for the purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of such crimes.\"\n\nOn May 3, officials from the ICC openly reproached efforts to tamper and modify any opinions on the part of the body regarding its activities. The ICC welcomed, according to Khan, \"open communication\" with government officials and non-governmental entities, and would only engage in discussions so long as they were \"consistent with its mandate under the Rome Statute to act independently and impartially\".\n\nAs he continued to explain in his statement, Khan argued\n\n\"That independence and impartiality are undermined ... when individuals threaten to retaliate ... should the office, in fulfilment of its mandate, make decisions about investigations or cases falling within its jurisdiction\". He demanded that \"all attempts to impede, intimidate or improperly influence its officials cease immediately.\"\n\nNetanyahu had previously promised that, under his leadership, \"Israel will never accept any attempt by the ICC to undermine its inherent right of self-defense.\" He regarded any \"threat to seize the soldiers and officials of the Middle East's only democracy and the world's only Jewish state\" as \"outrageous.\" Going heavy on the forces of light battling those of darkness - a favourite theme of his - the Israeli PM went on to claim that such actions \"would set a dangerous precedent that threatens the soldiers and officials of all democracies fighting savage terrorism and wanton aggression\".\n\nFar from threatening democracies of whatever flavour, the actions of the ICC can serve the opposite purpose, holding individuals in high office accountable for egregious crimes in international law. In doing so, it can contribute, in no small part, to efforts in defeating impunity and rebutting brutal and often callous assertions of self-defence.\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.

Israel Axios", "body": "Some Republicans are reportedly hoping to dissuade the international court from issuing arrest warrants for the Israeli leadership\n\nA group of Republican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives is devising sanctions against the International Criminal Court (ICC) in a bid to protect Israeli leaders, Axios has reported.\n\nThe measures are aimed at deterring the international body from issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and several other senior officials over the ongoing military campaign against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nLaunched following the incursion by the militant group on October 7, which claimed the lives of around 1,200 Israelis, the offensive has resulted in the deaths of nearly 35,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to Hamas-controlled health authorities.\n\nThe campaign has widely been regarded as a disproportionate and heavy-handed response by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), and has attracted increasing criticism in recent months, including from countries that traditionally back Israel, such as the US and some Western European nations.\n\nIn January, the United Nations International Court of Justice (ICJ) said in a ruling that it was \"plausible\" that the Israeli military had committed genocide in the densely populated Palestinian enclave.\n\nOver the past few weeks, several media outlets have claimed that the ICC could charge the Israeli leadership with war crimes.\n\nIn an article on Tuesday, Axios quoted House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul as saying that he and his colleagues had been in contact with ICC prosecutor Karim Khan.\n\n\"We're not sure if the arrest warrants are imminent, but it's sort of a precaution to let them know that, if they do, we have this legislation ready to go,\" he revealed.\n\nLate last month, Republican and Democrat US representatives issued a statement warning the ICC of \"consequences\" in the event that it pursued the Israeli prime minister and other officials.\n\nTheir colleagues in the US Senate held a virtual meeting with ICC representatives last week to convey their concerns, Axios reported.\n\nKhan said in a statement released last Friday that threats to \"retaliate against the court or against court personnel\" undermine the international body's independence and impartiality.\n\n\"The Office insists that all attempts to impede, intimidate or improperly influence its officials cease immediately,\" he wrote.\n\nNetanyahu has accused the judicial body of seeking to \"paralyze Israel's very ability to defend itself,\" while fanning the \"fires of anti-Semitism.\"\n\nIn late April, Axios, citing two anonymous Israeli officials, claimed that the Israeli prime minister had asked US President Joe Biden to stop the ICC from issuing arrest warrants.", "source": {"uri": "polandsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Poland Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

For several weeks, rumors have swirled that the ICC is preparing to issue arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, the country's defense minister and the chief of its armed forces. The word is they will be charged with war crimes. The ICC is also reportedly preparing arrest warrants for the leaders of Hamas.\n\nThe rumors follow more than seven months of nonstop carnage that began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups launched a coordinated attack on Israel, killing 1,149 people, including 766 civilians, and abducting another 247 as hostages, including women, children, grandparents and people with disabilities. There have also been allegations of gang rape and sexual mutilation leveled against Hamas and its collaborators.\n\nPalestinian casualties have been far greater. More than 34,000 Palestinians have died as a result of Israel's military response, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry; more than 70,000 have been wounded. According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNWRA), an estimated 1.7 million Gazans have been displaced. Equally alarming, the head of the United Nations World Food Program has declared that conditions in northern Gaza have deteriorated into a \"full-blown famine.\"\n\nNetanyahu, as expected, has denounced the ICC. In a speech delivered on May 5, the first day of the annual weeklong commemoration of the Holocaust, he claimed that any arrest warrants would leave an \"indelible stain\" on international law and constitute an \"unprecedented antisemitic hate crime\" that would fuel antisemitism around the world.\"\n\nWhat's happening on college campuses across the U.S., he added, is \"reminiscent of things that happened in German universities in the 1930s. Yes, they smashed windows there, too, only this time it's happening in America in 2024.\" Portraying himself as the savior of the Jewish people, he pledged to continue the fight against Hamas, even if \"Israel has to stand alone.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, Netanyahu has been pleading for help from the U.S., urging the Biden administration and congressional leaders from both major parties to pressure the ICC to drop its investigation. Thus far, his pleas appear to be well received. On April 29, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that President Biden has \"been very clear\" that he objects to the ICC's investigation.\n\nBiden, whose relationship with Netanyahu has often been described as \"strained,\" echoed the prime minister's concerns in the keynote address he gave on May 6 at the official U.S. Holocaust memorial service in Washington, D.C., remarking:\n\nI understand people have strong beliefs and deep convictions about the world. In America, we respect and protect the fundamental right to free speech, to debate and disagree. I understand. That's America. But there is no place on any [college] campus in America or any place in America for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.\n\nRepublican leaders have been more outspoken in their support for Netanyahu and condemnation of the ICC. In an April 24 letter sent to ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan (which was recently published by Zeteo, a new media organization founded by investigative journalist Mehdi Hasan), 12 Republican senators -- including Tom Cotton, Tim Scott, Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rick Scott -- warned Khan that any arrest warrants for Israeli officials would be interpreted \"not only as a threat to Israel's sovereignty but to the sovereignty of the United States.\"\n\n\"Target Israel and we will target you,\" the letter concluded, \"and bar you and your families from the United States. You have been warned.\"\n\nThis is not the first time U.S. leaders have bullied the ICC. In 2020, after the court opened an investigation into possible war crimes committed by both the Taliban and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, the Trump administration revoked the visas of the court's lead and assistant prosecutors and froze their U.S. assets. The Biden administration lifted the sanctions, but continues to oppose the probe, which is moving forward slowly.\n\nTrump may have taken ICC antipathy to new heights, but the U.S. has never endorsed the court's mission. Founded after a 1998 conference attended by 160 nations in Rome, the ICC was established as the first treaty-based international criminal court with the power to investigate and try governmental and nonstate actors accused of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and wars of aggression.\n\nThe Rome Statute authorizes the court to impose heavy jail sentences up to life imprisonment. The court has its own detention facilities, but orders convicted defendants to serve their time in prisons run by nearby member states. In the 31 cases the ICC has opened since its inception, some involving more than one suspect, there have been 10 convictions and four acquittals.\n\nSome 124 countries have signed the Rome Statute. Palestine, under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority, became a member state in 2015. However, neither the United States nor Israel have joined the court over fears that it could one day charge their citizens with international crimes.\n\nAlthough the ICC has been criticized in the past for targeting African human rights violators, the court's image as a pawn of the great powers began to change with the opening of probes into U.S. actions in Afghanistan and, in 2021, possible Israeli war crimes in the occupied West Bank.\n\nIn March 2023, the court took another historic step by issuing arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the commissioner for children's rights in the Office of the President of the Russian Federation. The warrants charge Putin and Lvova-Belova with war crimes for the deportation of Ukrainian children from occupied areas to Russia.\n\nWhat concerns Netanyahu and his ultra-right government most is the court's decision, announced late last year, that it was broadening its West Bank inquiry to include the conduct of the war in Gaza. Israel may not be a member of the court, but Palestine is, and the court has jurisdiction to investigate the war. Under the Rome Statute, the court's jurisdiction encompasses crimes committed by anyone within the territory of a member state.\n\nThe ICC has no police or arrest powers of its own, but once an arrest warrant is issued, member states are obligated to take suspects into custody. Last summer, the threat of arrest deterred Putin from traveling to South Africa (a member state) to attend a summit of developing nations. Russia responded to Putin's indictment with retaliatory arrest warrants of its own, calling for the apprehension of Khan and several ICC judges.\n\nIf indicted by the ICC, Netanyahu would face a similar risk of arrest if he traveled to a member state. Nearly all European countries would be off-limits.\n\nEven if the Biden administration isn't prepared to endorse U.S. membership, it must step aside and let the court do the critical work it was designed to accomplish. The ICC's Gaza probe offers an historic opportunity to demonstrate U.S. commitment to international law -- one the administration cannot afford to miss.", "source": {"uri": "truthdig.com", "dataType":

Nitsana Darshan Leitner, president of the Shurat Hadin-Israel Law Center, specifically called for the invocation of the American Service-Members' Protection Act (ASPA), which establishes that American allies should be defended against international prosecution.\n\n\"There might already be a decision to arrest certain Israeli leaders and senior IDF officers, however, as a result of the intervention of several western states, the prosecutor's office has not pulled the trigger yet,\" Leitner told JNS on Monday.\n\n\"Right now it could still go either way, and no one should be surprised if [ICC prosecutor Karim] Khan issues warrants against both Israel and Hamas,\" she continued.\n\n\"At the same time, several close E.U. countries, as well as the United States, have sent The Hague a clear message not to act now as it could jeopardize any hostage deal and a ceasefire. It's really uncertain what Khan will do or when, but it's a snake in the grass waiting to strike,\" she added.\n\nLast week, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) called the prospective warrants \"disgraceful\" and \"lawless,\" and noted that they could set a dangerous precedent.\n\n\"If unchallenged by the Biden administration, the ICC could create and assume unprecedented power to issue arrest warrants against American political leaders, American diplomats and American military personnel,\" he said.\n\n\"Instead of wrongly targeting Israel, the ICC should pursue charges against Iran and its terror proxies, including Hamas, for engaging in horrific war crimes,\" he added.\n\nJohnson called on the Biden administration to \"immediately and unequivocally demand that the ICC stand down\" and \"use every available tool to prevent such an abomination.\"\n\nIsrael believes that the ICC could issue arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi.\n\nThe warrants would likely be issued against the backdrop of the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, where the IDF is fighting Hamas, as well as accusations that Israel breached the Fourth Geneva Convention related to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.\n\n\"If the ICC moves to arrest Israelis, those named could fear being arrested in any of the member countries,\" said Leitner.\n\n\"There is an obligation under the Rome Treaty to detain anyone ordered to be arrested by the Chief Prosecutor's office. It would be really dangerous for senior Israelis and IDF officers to travel to any of the member states,\" she added.\n\nLeitner further explained that even while traveling on a diplomatic passport and after receiving assurances from the host country, Israeli officials would be at risk of being placed under arrest through local court orders.\n\nShe added that the failure of Israel to turn over requested persons could result in all kinds of economic sanctions. El Al planes could even be barred from landing in certain countries.\n\n\"Member states that are allied with Israel would be placed between a rock and a hard place,\" she said.\n\n\"This is why Israel and the United States must fight these potential warrants. Biden and the U.S. Senate need to straight-out threaten the ICC with retaliation, blacklists and fierce sanctions of their own. They need to let Khan know that arresting Israelis will be the end of the court,\" she added.\n\nLast week, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said that if the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli political and military leaders over the war against Hamas, it would constitute an \"unprecedented antisemitic hate crime\" and a \"scandal of historical magnitude.\"\n\nHe went on to state that, \"Eighty years after the Holocaust, the international bodies established with the goal of preventing another Holocaust are considering denying the Jewish state its right to defend itself.\"\n\nNetanyahu noted that this marks the first time that a democratic country committed to international law is defending itself from accusations of war crimes while at the same time facing existential threats.\n\nLeitner reiterated that while there are many precedents of the ICC going after world leaders, those have to date not include democratic leaders.\n\n\"Most prominently, they issued arrest warrants for Russia's Vladimir Putin and Russian Commissioner for Children's Rights Maria Lvova Belova for kidnapping Ukrainian children during the war.

They warned of dire repercussions if the court decides to issue any arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or any senior officials of the Zionist entity.\n\nAccording to Palinfo, the letter, which was leaked and published by neutral media on Tuesday, addressed Karim Khan: \"We are writing to you regarding reports that the ICC may consider issuing international arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Zionist officials. These actions are illegitimate, lack legal basis and, if implemented, will result in severe penalties against you and your organization.\" According to the text of the letter.\n\nIn their letter, the U.S. senators stressed that \"issuing arrest warrants to the leaders of the Zionist entity would not only be unjustified, but would expose your ICC to hypocrisy and double standards. \"Your office has not issued arrest warrants against Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, or any other Iranian official, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad or any other Syrian official.\"\n\nIn their letter, they revealed that they would seek severe sanctions on the ICC president and members, saying: \"The United States will not tolerate politicized attacks by the ICC against our allies. Target Israel and we will target you. If you take the actions outlined in the report, we will end all U.S. support for the ICC, impose sanctions on your staff and colleagues, and bar you and your family from entering the United States.\"\n\nThe U.S. senators who signed the letter concluded by saying, \"You have been warned.\"\n\nE.M", "source": {"uri": "saba.ye", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0633\u0628\u0623\u0646\u062a - \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0633\u0628\u0623"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_entity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zionist entity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol_notice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interpol notice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ali Khamenei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Syria"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bashar al-Assad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.saba.ye/storage/larage/0852ab2d2ed75bfd2940e93155b776d3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545985", "eventUri": "eng-9545985", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1, "textEnd": 7, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

It can also prosecute crimes committed on the territory of a state that is party to the treaty whether or not the defendant's state is party to the Rome Statute.\n\nEven though Israel is not a party to the treaty, Palestine is a member state. Thus, the ICC can prosecute Israeli officials for complicity in crimes that Israel Defence Forces soldiers allegedly committed on Palestinian territory. Conversely, the court has jurisdiction over individual members of Hamas (as Palestinian nationals) for the international crimes they allegedly committed in Israel.\n\nThe same legal principle has been used in the case of Russia, which is not a party to the Rome Statute. In 2022, a group of 39 countries, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, called on the ICC to investigate the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This resulted in the ICC issuing an arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin for committing war crimes on Ukrainian territory - a move applauded by US President Joe Biden.\n\nIt would be contradictory for any of these states to accept the ICC's jurisdiction over Russian nationals but not those of Israel.\n\nOn the eve of his appointment as the US' chief prosecutor for the Nuremberg trials, Supreme Court justice Robert Jackson said: \"We cannot successfully co-operate with the rest of the world in establishing a reign of law unless we are prepared to have that law sometimes operate against what would be our national advantage.\" This is a rule of good faith that must guide attitudes towards the world's top courts.\n\nIn inquiring into a charge, the ICC singularly focuses on whether the defendant is guilty of the crime as charged according to international law. That inquiry is devoid of politics - or political interference.\n\nIt is regrettable that some states have been unwilling to support the court - notably in the execution of arrest warrants - when their friends and allies are concerned. For example, many African and Middle Eastern governments failed to arrest former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir when he travelled to their countries.This has left many of the court's arrests warrants unexecuted. In some instances, member states such as Canada, Germany, Nigeria and the UK have made public statements supporting their political allies in situations before the court, notwithstanding that such statements are purely political and tend to undermine the global perception of the court.\n\nThough it remains unconfirmed, it is likely that any ICC arrest warrant against Israeli officials would include the charge of the use of starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza, given the utterances of Israeli officials themselves and the obstruction of food and aid that have been widely decried by many.\n\nHowever, arrest warrants and indictments do not mean that the people charged are guilty of the crimes. While an ICC inquiry is ongoing, the defendant will enjoy the presumption of innocence throughout and will be afforded every opportunity to defend themselves.\n\nAt the end of the trial, the three judges will decide - by majority - whether the evidence the prosecutor marshalled against the defendant satisfied the required standard of proof for conviction. And that bar is very high.\n\nThere have been many cases at the ICC where the judges convicted the defendants because that high standard of proof was met. But there have also been cases in which ICC judges have acquitted defendants at the end of their trials or appeals. Notable examples include former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo and one of his ministers, Charles Ble Goude, who were acquitted at their trial. The conviction of Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former Congolese senator and vice president, was overturned on appeal.\n\nUltimately, the question turns to what arrest warrants would mean, in the meantime, for Israeli officials. Based on the ICC's previous experience, it would not mean an immediate arrest and trial. Bashir has still not been arrested or tried, even though his arrest warrant was issued in 2009. For a long time, before he was deposed, he kept travelling to friendly states that did not arrest him. Their argument was that customary international law recognised immunity for him as a head of state. But finally in 2019, the ICC Appeals Chamber stated clearly that no such immunity existed in relation to cases before international tribunals, especially the ICC.\n\nThe immediate problem for Israeli officials under any ICC arrest warrant would be that the court's 124 member states would be under a legal obligation to arrest such officials if they travelled to any of those 124 countries. That obligation should not be underestimated - just last year, Vladimir Putin cancelled his plans to attend the BRICS summit in South Africa, in the apparent light of Pretoria's obligation to arrest him.", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Statute", "type": "wiki",

They contended that the ICC would be aligned with the \"largest state sponsor of terrorism\" if such warrants were issued.\n\nThe signatories cautioned that the US' and Israel's sovereignty would be in danger if such warrants were issued. They declared, \"Target Israel and we will target you,\" threatening retaliatory action. They also promised to stop US backing for the ICC and to ban Khan and his family from entering the country. In closing, the letter said, \"You have been warned.\"\n\nThe ICC Prosecutor's Office acknowledged the substantial public interest in ongoing investigations in a statement released in response to the letter, and it encouraged discussion. Nevertheless, it issued a warning against anyone intending to take legal retribution against the court, citing Article 70 of the Rome Statute that forbids such measures.\n\nEven though the ICC has asserted jurisdiction over Palestinian territory, the US does not recognise this jurisdiction and is not a signatory to the Rome Statute. In addition, the letter made mention of the American Service-Members' Protection Act, which forbids funding to the International Criminal Court and gives the US president the authority to take the required actions to ensure the release of any jailed US citizen or ally.\n\nAfter the letter was made public, Bob Rae, Canada's Permanent Representative to the UN, underlined how important it is for the ICC to function without fear. In an additional correspondence, Senator Cotton's staff affirmed the letter's legitimacy to JURIST.\n\nThe ICC has the authority to prosecute individuals for alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Presently, Israel faces genocide accusations brought by South Africa in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which has imposed provisional measures in response to Israel's Gaza offensive.",

Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Brian Mast, R-Fla., are pressuring the Biden administration to threaten sanctions against International Criminal Court (ICC) officials if the body goes after the U.S. or U.S. allies that do not fall under its jurisdiction.\n\nIt comes amid reports that the ICC is preparing warrants against top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, over their handling of humanitarian aid in Gaza during the Middle Eastern nation's war on terror group Hamas.\n\nThey're leading a new bill to force President Biden's hand called The Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act, along with 15 House GOP co-sponsors, including House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Republican Study Committee Chair Kevin Hern, R-Okla.\n\nCALIFORNIA STATE OFFICIALS CONDEMN VIOLENT ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS AT UCLA\n\nAccording to legislative text obtained by Fox News Digital, it would force Biden to sanction an ICC-related entity or person \"no later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act, if the International Criminal Court is engaging in any attempt to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute any protected person.\"\n\n\"The ICC is an illegitimate court that represents a massive threat to U.S. sovereignty. The Trump administration was right to impose sanctions on the associates of the ICC if they dare go after U.S. citizens, service members, or our allies,\" Roy told Fox News Digital. \"Biden's decision to reverse that policy was weak, embarrassing, and wrong.\"\n\nISRAEL URGES PALESTINIANS TO EVACUATE RAFAH AHEAD OF EXPECTED GROUND OPERATION IN HAMAS STRONGHOLD\n\nRoy said of reports that the ICC may target Israel, \"If the ICC goes after our allies, there will be consequences.\"\n\nIsrael is not under the ICC's jurisdiction. The Palestinian territories, however, were admitted in 2015.\n\nMast said their bill sent a \"clear message\" to the ICC, adding, \"We may not recognize you, but you sure as hell will recognize what happens when you target America or its allies.\"\n\nMast is a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where the bill will have to advance before a possible House-wide vote. A U.S. Army veteran, he also previously served with the Israeli Defense Force (IDF).\n\nStefanik, the No. 3 House Republican, accused the ICC of \"a campaign to undermine the only democracy in the Middle East, while turning a blind eye to the numerous human rights atrocities committed by Hamas.\"\n\n\"This double standard is an abuse of power by the ICC and exposes their irrelevance,\" she said.\n\nState Department deputy spokesman Vidant Patel would not confirm or deny whether the U.S. was aware of the ICC's reported plans during a press briefing early last week, but he told reporters, \"On this investigation, our position is clear. We continue to believe that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over the Palestinian situation.\"\n\nISRAELI TROOPS GAIN OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF GAZAN SIDE OF RAFAH CROSSING, IDF SAYS\n\nIsraeli officials are concerned that the ICC is preparing arrest warrants over Israel's response to the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by the terrorist group Hamas, the New York Times reported last Monday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIsrael has been accused of blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza while waging a ground invasion and airstrike campaign in order to get Israeli hostages being held by Hamas back to their homes. But there's been mounting criticism of Israel on the world stage over the severity of its response.\n\nNetanyahu said on X last week in response to the report, \"Under my leadership, Israel will never accept any attempt by the ICC to undermine its inherent right of self-defense.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"body": "A group of Republican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives is devising sanctions against the International Criminal Court (ICC) in a bid to protect Israeli leaders, Axios has reported.\n\nThe measures are aimed at deterring the international body from issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and several other senior officials over the ongoing military campaign against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nLaunched following the incursion by the militant group on October 7, which claimed the lives of around 1,200 Israelis, the offensive has resulted in the deaths of nearly 35,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to Hamas-controlled health authorities.\n\nThe campaign has widely been regarded as a disproportionate and heavy-handed response by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), and has attracted increasing criticism in recent months, including from countries that traditionally back Israel, such as the US and some Western European nations.\n\nIn January, the United Nations International Court of Justice (ICJ) said in a ruling that it was \"plausible\" that the Israeli military had committed genocide in the densely populated Palestinian enclave.\n\nOver the past few weeks, several media outlets have claimed that the ICC could charge the Israeli leadership with war crimes.\n\nIn an article on Tuesday, Axios quoted House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul as saying that he and his colleagues had been in contact with ICC prosecutor Karim Khan.\n\n\"We're not sure if the arrest warrants are imminent, but it's sort of a precaution to let them know that, if they do, we have this legislation ready to go,\" he revealed.\n\nLate last month, Republican and Democrat US representatives issued a statement warning the ICC of \"consequences\" in the event that it pursued the Israeli prime minister and other officials.\n\nTheir colleagues in the US Senate held a virtual meeting with ICC representatives last week to convey their concerns, Axios reported.\n\nKhan said in a statement released last Friday that threats to \"retaliate against the court or against court personnel\" undermine the international body's independence and impartiality.\n\n\"The Office insists that all attempts to impede, intimidate or improperly influence its officials cease immediately,\" he wrote.\n\nNetanyahu has accused the judicial body of seeking to \"paralyze Israel's very ability to defend itself,\" while fanning the \"fires of anti-Semitism.\"\n\nIn late April, Axios, citing two anonymous Israeli officials, claimed that the Israeli prime minister had asked US President Joe Biden to stop the ICC from issuing arrest warrants.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"},

A group of American senators are making it rather literal.\n\nA threatening letter to Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) was obtained by the news site Zeteo.\n\nSigned by 12 Republican senators, the letter has to be read to be believed.\n\nThe expos\u00e9 came as Israel launched operations in Rafah, the last refuge in southern Gaza for more than a million Palestinians.\n\nDiplomatic protocol or official etiquette requires that threats made on record should at least be worded with finesse. Even gangsters are not supposed to directly threaten to burn down your house with your family inside. They usually finesse it: \u201cYou have a nice house and family. Shame if anything happened to them.\u201d\n\nBut not these tough guys from the US Congress who seem to have taken to heart the horse\u2019s head scene in The Godfather film.\n\nThey are angry that the ICC is reportedly preparing international arrest warrants for top Israeli leaders including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for alleged war crimes.\n\nIn addition to threatening sanctions against ICC prosecutors, their staff and families, these Deplorable Twelve also cite a US \u201cwar on terror\u201d law that could justify literally an invasion of The Hague. \u201cTarget Israel and we will target you,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cIf you issue a warrant for the arrest of the Israeli leadership, we will interpret this not only as a threat to Israel\u2019s sovereignty but [also] to the sovereignty of the United States.\u201d\n\nGo figure. The two countries have been acting practically as one. Many people are starting to think President Joe Biden and his cabinet answer to Netanyahu and not the other way around.\n\nThe letter continues, \u201cThe United States will not tolerate politicised attacks by the ICC on our allies \u2026 If you move forward with the measures \u2026 we will \u2026 sanction your employers and associates, and bar you and your families from the United States. You have been warned.\u201d\n\nBut the crux of the matter is really the American Service-Members\u2019 Protection Act (ASPA), which the letter said \u201cdemonstrated \u2026 the lengths to which we will go to protect that [US and Israeli?] sovereignty\u201d.\n\nSigned into law by George W. Bush in 2002 at the start of \u201cthe war on terror\u201d, ASPA anticipated the possibility that US personnel or foreigners working for them could face charges of war crime and crimes against humanity.\n\nIt is derisively known in diplomatic and legal circles as \u201cThe Hague Invasion Act\u201d because it authorises the US president \u201cto use all means necessary and appropriate\u201d to bring about the release not only of US citizens but also allies who are imprisoned or detained by the ICC.\n\nSo what\u2019s next? Deploy Mossad assassins and Delta Force operatives to the ICC headquarters, or try a surgical bomb strike at it?\n\nWhen asked for a comment, Katie Britt, one of the letter\u2019s signatories, told Zeteo that it was \u201cnot a threat \u2013 a promise.\u201d\n\nThe White House refused to comment on the letter, but has said previously that it opposes the ICC probe.\n\nZeteo is a new media outfit set up by respected broadcaster Mehdi Hasan, who was reportedly forced to resign as a current affairs host on MSNBC following his tough questioning, live on TV, of an Israeli spokesman about the war in Gaza.\n\nOf course, this is not the first time the United States has threatened the ICC.\n\nKhan\u2019s predecessor, Fatou Bensouda \u2013 along with her immediate family and financial assets \u2013 and her deputy Phakiso Mochochoko, were sanctioned by the Donald Trump administration after she launched an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by the US military in Afghanistan.\n\nThe sanctions were lifted by Biden after Khan put the probe on the back burner, essentially burying it.\n\nThe senators no doubt think he will play ball again with a little push.\n\nBut this is too obvious. If Khan backs down now, you might as well fold the ICC and say bye-bye to international law.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War on terror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol_notice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interpol notice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Britt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Britt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phakiso_Mochochoko", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phakiso Mochochoko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatou_Bensouda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatou Bensouda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehdi_Hasan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mehdi Hasan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delta Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mossad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crimes against humanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Washington is reportedly trying to dissuade ICC chief Prosecutor Karim Khan from filing charges, but its arguments, both legal and practical, are weak.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fears that the International Criminal Court (ICC) will soon charge him for alleged war crimes in Gaza and has appealed to the Biden administration for help. Washington is reportedly trying to dissuade ICC chief Prosecutor Karim Khan from filing charges, but its arguments, both legal and practical, are weak.\n\nKhan has not said what he is planning, but the most likely charges will be for obstructing access to food and other humanitarian aid. Khan has already warned the Netanyahu government that this reported obstruction could lead to ICC action, and given Israel's refusal to allow the court's investigators into Gaza, the proof of obstruction -- in the form of widely acknowledged famine conditions -- is more readily available than evidence concerning Israel's indiscriminate and disproportionate bombing of Palestinian civilians. Senior officials in Hamas's military chain of command are also likely to face charges for the atrocities that the group committed on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nThe Israeli government claims that it has not restricted the flow of aid, but this denial of Netanyahu's starvation strategy is not credible, given the extensive reporting on the needless obstacles that Israeli officials have erected to humanitarian aid entering Gaza. Instead, the Netanyahu government has responded to the possibility of ICC charges with threats, saying it would retaliate against the Palestinian Authority, potentially leading to its collapse.\n\nThat threat has a shoot-yourself-in-the-foot quality, given the PA's service to Israel in helping to keep the lid on an endlessly occupied population in the West Bank. But it also shows Israel's unwillingness to seriously grapple with the charges. If there were a conscientious domestic prosecutorial effort to hold those obstructing aid accountable, the ICC would be required to defer to it under its principle of complementarity.\n\nThe Biden administration's response has been no better. Rather than recognize that the ICC represents an independent effort to uphold the international rule of law in the much-touted \"rules-based order,\" a spokesperson for the administration claimed that the court did not have jurisdiction. That is an allusion to the long-standing U.S. opposition to the ICC exercising jurisdiction over the nationals of governments that have not joined the court, even if their alleged crimes were committed on the territory of a government that is a court member.\n\nBut Washington's objections to such territorial jurisdiction were overruled by the governments that created the court in Rome more than two decades ago. And the U.S. government effectively abandoned that argument as well after the ICC used territorial jurisdiction in March 2023 to charge Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes in Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden said those charges were \"justified,\" and the U.S. Senate unanimously agreed. That makes sense, because it is an essential attribute of sovereignty to address crimes on a nation's territory regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator. Palestine, as a recognized U.N. observer state, has conferred jurisdiction to the ICC, and the court's judges have approved Khan's investigation.\n\nGiven the weakness of the jurisdictional argument, the administration is reportedly falling back on supposedly pragmatic appeals. \"We are quietly encouraging the ICC not to do it. It will blow up everything,\" a U.S. official told Axios.\n\nThis is the latest variation of the old argument that justice impedes peace -- which implies that a leader facing criminal charges is more likely to keep fighting than to accept the need for a settlement. But history shows that charges for war crimes often facilitate peace efforts by marginalizing an abusive leader.\n\nFor example, in his book To End a War, the former U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke made clear that the Dayton Peace Agreement resolving the Bosnian conflict of the 1990s was possible only because the International Criminal Tribunal for the former nation of Yugoslavia had already charged the Bosnian Serb military and political leaders, Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, precluding their travel to Dayton without risking arrest. Holbrooke made his remarkable deal with the Serbian president, Slobodan Milosevic, who had not yet been charged.\n\nCharges against former Liberian President Charles Taylor, issued by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, led to his rapid loss of power and paved the way for the brutal Liberian conflict to end and a strong democracy to emerge. ICC charges against the leaders of the Uganda-based Lord's Resistance Army, which was notorious for kidnapping children and making them become soldiers, forced the leaders into hiding, the organization to splinter, and its military presence to weaken substantially.\n\nICC charges against Netanyahu could have a similar salutary effect. Today, Netanyahu is a major obstacle to a lasting cease-fire in Gaza. He has been taking extreme positions because he is beholden to two far-right ministers, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, if he hopes to stay in power and avoid possible prison time on corruption charges that predate the current conflict.\n\nAs a result, Netanyahu has undermined a key incentive for Hamas to agree to a cease-fire deal by saying that he would invade Rafah, the southern Gaza city where 1.4 million Palestinian civilians are sheltering, \"with or without a deal.\"\n\nTaking that threat a step further, his government has ordered Palestinians to evacuate eastern Rafah, and Israeli troops have taken control of the city's border crossing with Egypt. Similarly, Netanyahu has ruled out the establishment a Palestinian state, let alone equal rights within the existing \"one-state reality\" between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, leaving Palestinians with the unpalatable options of ongoing apartheid or mass expulsion.\n\nThere is no way to know how the Israeli public will respond to potential ICC charges against Netanyahu, but they are likely to underscore that his prioritization of his own power and future has become a profound liability for Israel. That would make it more likely for Israelis to usher in a government that is more open to the kinds of difficult compromises needed to free the hostages, end the bloodshed in Gaza, and remove the perennial threat of armed conflict that has so destabilized the region.\n\nAs it did for the alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine, the Biden administration should stand aside and let the ICC process run its course.", "source": {"uri": "foreignpolicy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Foreign Policy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden",

One of the most critical theaters of the current war, however, has increasingly been not Lebanon or Gaza, but The Hague.\n\nIncreasingly, anti-Israel activists have been investing in lawfare as one of the most effective weapons with which to weaken and delegitimize Israel. According to recent reports, the International Criminal Court is now considering issuing arrest warrants against various high-ranking Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi.\n\nThis move is being egged on by a series of countries in the anti-Israel coalition including, most notably, South Africa and Turkey.\n\n\"This is a case that has nothing to do with international law and everything to do with political interests,\" Avraham Shalev, an expert in public law for the Kohelet Policy Forum, told JNS.\n\nThe ICC has never issued an arrest warrant against the leader of a democratic country, and if it follows through, Netanyahu would find himself in the undesirable company of Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir, former Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the only national leaders with arrest warrants from the ICC.\n\nThere is currently no concrete statement from the ICC regarding the legal details surrounding a potential indictment of Israeli officials. In 2021, then-chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda opened an investigation into \"possible crimes committed in the West Bank and Gaza\" by Israel. Notably, Bensouda decided to set the chronological limit of the investigation at June 13, exactly one day after Palestinian terrorists kidnapped and murdered three Israeli teenagers, thereby launching \"Operation Brother's Keeper\" and \"Operation Protective Edge.\"\n\nIn this way, the ICC probe initially sought to \"probe Israeli attacks on civilian populations and violations of international law during Operation Protective Edge\" without the context of the terrorist activity that sparked the 2014 Gaza war. \"In the very setup of the case you can see an inbuilt bias against Israel,\" said Shalev.\n\nThe current case against Israeli officials is quite broad and will likely look at \"Israeli settlement activity, and use of disproportionate force during Protective Edge,\" with alleged transgressions from the ongoing conflict likely being tagged onto the already existing case, he explained.\n\nThe ICC's prosecutor, Karim Khan, has made statements regarding Israel's provision of humanitarian aid and targeting of civilian infrastructure, implying that both might play a role in a future criminal prosecution. In a speech on Oct. 30 Khan said, \" I want to underline clearly to Israel that supplies must get to the civilians of Gaza without delay,\" and cautioned Israel to \"demonstrate the proper application of the principles of distinction, precaution and of proportionality.\"\n\nAccording to the laws of war, countries are required to allow humanitarian aid into affected areas under the condition that the aid reaches the civilian population and is not being seized by enemy forces.\n\n\"There is absolute documentation of Hamas taking over humanitarian convoys and preventing the aid from getting to civilians. This removes the legal necessity for Israel to participate or allow humanitarian aid,\" Shalev told JNS.\n\nFurthermore, even if Israel were to enforce a full siege of Gaza, this could still be a legal method of warfare under international law, he said. According to the Geneva Convention and International Humanitarian Law (IHL), \"The prohibition of starvation as a method of warfare does not prohibit siege warfare as long as the purpose is to achieve a military objective and not to starve a civilian population.\"\n\nIsrael's rejection of ICC jurisdiction, including the territory of Gaza, Judea and Samaria, presents a further legal hurdle, he explained.\n\nThe ICC's jurisdiction extends over crimes committed \"on the territory of a State Party [to the Rome Statute] or by one of its nationals,\" which does not include Israel but according to the ICC does include \"Palestine,\" as the Palestinian Authority did sign on to the Rome Statute in its capacity as a U.N. observer state.\n\nThe ICC has sought to legitimize its shaky claims of jurisdiction by passively going after Palestinian terror groups in tandem with its case against Israeli officials. Following a visit to Israel in December 2023, Khan said that the ICC was investigating the crimes against Israeli civilians as \"some of the most serious international crimes that shock the conscience of humanity.\"\n\nA source close to the ICC prosecutor's office told JNS that \"any arrest warrant against Israeli officials will likely come together with warrants against members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad to give the court a balanced image.\"\n\nHowever, the impact of an indictment will likely be far greater on Israel than on Hamas.\n\n\"The effect on Israel's reputation as a democratic country will be much worse than for a fundamentalist terror group like Hamas,\" said Shalev.\n\nThe case before the ICC is also legally problematic due to the issue of complementarity. The principle of complementarity indicates that \"a case is inadmissible before the ICC if it is currently under investigation by a state with jurisdiction over it,\" as stated in the Rome Statute.\n\nMultiple cases of alleged international law violations are being tried in Israeli military courts. Khan himself has previously recognized that \"Israel has a professional and well-trained military with military advocate generals and a system that is intended to ensure their compliance with international humanitarian law, and lawyers advising on targeting decisions.\" Therefore, any case brought against Israeli nationals would first have to prove that the Israeli legal system is incapable of or unwilling to probe the alleged violation fairly.\n\nAccording to experts, the recent displays of anti-Israel bias at the ICC are not a bug but a feature.\n\n\"From the very beginning, the Rome Statute was designed to go after Israel,\" Shalev explained. When the statute was being formulated, most of the clauses were taken almost verbatim from the Geneva Convention, with the exception of the section involving the laws regarding population transfer.\n\nArticle 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention specifically forbids the forced transfer of populations to or from an occupied territory. However, at the request of various Arab states at the Rome conference, this definition was expanded to \"the transfer, directly or indirectly, by the Occupying Power of parts of its civilian population into the territory it occupies.\" Though this expanded definition could have been applied in several cases, including Turkey's settlement policy in Cyprus and Russia's transfer of population into Ukraine, this clause has only been used to go after Israeli communities in Judea and Samaria.\n\n\"The very formulation of the Rome Statute was designed to criminalize the presence of Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria. Under these terms, building roads, allowing Jews to own property and many other things can be called 'indirect population transfer,'\" said Shalev. \"This clause has Israel's name on it,\" he added.\n\nThough ICC arrest warrants would certainly negatively affect Israel's international standing, it is important not to overstate the legal implications. In its 22 years, the ICC has never had a single successful conviction and arrest without cooperation from the defendant's host nation. While technically signatories to the Rome Statute, including most European countries, would have an obligation to carry out such warrants, there is a long-standing precedent for diplomatic arrangements being made to skirt ICC rulings.\n\nIn other words, even if a warrant is issued, \"There won't be police on the tarmac in Europe if Netanyahu goes abroad,\" Shalev explained. \"There is a lot of leeway in reality,\" he added.\n\nThe current conflict with the ICC has led to various methodologies being advanced to counter the growing threat of lawfare. Former deputy attorney-general Roy Schondorf, who led Israel's efforts to defend itself against war crimes accusations and the ICC for about 13 years until mid-2022, has strongly advocated leaning on complementarity as a legal shield.\n\nIsrael can protect itself by \"opening an external, independent Israeli state inquiry, to be led by a former judge,\" he said. This model was successfully used in 2008-9 by the Turkel Commission, which Israel used to block investigations by the ICC and the U.N. Goldstone Commission Inquiry. Other experts have proposed a more aggressive approach to dealing with the ICC.\n\n\"We shouldn't fall into the trap of thinking that if we cooperate and we show the world we are playing by the rules then sooner or later they will see our perspective,\" said Shalev. \"Ultimately this is not a question of law; by every metric the legal arguments are flawed. There is a clear political angle and our best bet is to stonewall. Don't talk to them, don't release documents and don't engage,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "thejewishvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Voice"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Israel's plan to claim every inch of it is stated unequivocally in the Likud Party Platform of 1977. It reads, \"between the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty.\"\n\nFor challenging Israel's brutal settler-colonial project and genocide in Gaza, pro-Palestinian demonstrators have felt the wrath of Israel's supporters in government, education and corporate media.\n\nAdministrators at distinguished universities like Columbia, Emory and the University of California, Los Angeles have resorted to force to suppress demonstrators calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and for their universities to divest from companies with ties to Israel. And at UCLA, administrators and law enforcement failed to act as counterprotestors violently attacked pro-Palestinian encampments.\n\nStudents have experienced firsthand the repressive nature of the state when it wants to quash a message. They have learned how practiced in domination the United States and Israel are.\n\nThe Palestinian solidarity encampments have unnerved those who wield power because they are a symbol of unity and resistance against oppression. It is interesting to note that the white nationalist \"Unite the Right\" rally of 2017, as vile as it was, did not evoke the same heavy-handed response from administrators and police.\n\nOn August 11 of that year, hundreds of white supremacists marched through the University of Virginia campus chanting Nazi and antisemitic slogans. Although aware of the unsanctioned march, university officials and law enforcement took minimal action to prevent disorder and violence. Very few arrests were made and just a handful of far-right protestors and counter-protestors were subsequently convicted on charges of assault or disorderly conduct.\n\nIn contrast, more than 2,400 protestors on US campuses have been arrested since the police crackdown at Columbia University on April 18 sparked a wave of student activism. Ironically, some of the students arrested, who pay $67,264 a year in undergraduate tuition, were charged with \"trespassing.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden's response to the student protests is predictable. America's self-professed Zionist president has been more critical of US students for protesting against genocide in Gaza than he has been of the perpetrator. In his May 2 address on campus unrest, Biden never mentioned Gaza nor did he comment on Israel's scorched earth campaign, the source of the \"unrest.\" When asked if the protests have forced him to reconsider his policies, Biden brusquely stated \"no.\"\n\nIsraeli bombs have killed 13,000 Palestinian children and orphaned 19,000. Biden has been silent in the face of these atrocities. He was not so mute after the October 7 Palestinian incursion into Israel. Within a week he was on his way to Tel Aviv to hug Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and reaffirm his commitment to protect Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian solidarity movement has made it possible to finally tell and share the true story of Palestine in the United States. For eight decades, Israel, inoculated by Washington, the corporate media and threats of being labeled antisemitic, have successfully kept the story of Palestine and its people from the American public.\n\nAware that it has been losing control of its invented narrative, the Israeli regime has looked to its stakeholders in the United States and the West to suppress the message and messengers. In a desperate attempt to quell the growing pro-Palestine protests, on 24 April 2024, Netanyahu publicly called on US officials to use greater force to crackdown on American demonstrators, whom he compared to Nazis and described as \"antisemitic mobs\" who \"have to be stopped.\"\n\nIsrael's advocates at US universities, government and media have responded to Netanyahu's plea. Using the decades-old Israeli playbook on how to discredit the opposition, justify violence and distract from the message, they have drowned out protestors' demands by falsely portraying them as antisemitic, threats to safety, ill-informed and infiltrated by \"outside agitators.\"\n\nThe events of the last six months make it absolutely clear that the United States cannot be an honest broker when it comes to Israel. One example, among many, was the US reaction to recent reports that the International Criminal Court (ICC) might issue arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, over the regime's atrocities in Gaza.\n\nA worried Netanyahu went so far as to that if the ICC issues arrest warrants, he will take retaliatory measures against the Palestinian Authority. In 2021, Palestinian human rights organizations submitted their case regarding Israeli war crimes in Gaza to the Court.\n\nA number of Israel's champions in the US Congress (of both parties) have pressured the ICC not to act, threatening retaliation and drafting legislation should the Court go forward.\n\nBiden has stated that the United States does not support the ICC investigation, and has incorrectly claimed that the Court has no jurisdiction in this case. Because of US complicity in Israeli war crimes, the ICC could issue arrest warrants for American political leaders, diplomats and military personnel.\n\nInterestingly, although not a member of the ICC - established in the Hague in July 2002 to prosecute war criminals - the United States has made certain to protect itself and its allies from potential prosecution.\n\nIn August 2002, for example, the US Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed the American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002, nicknamed \"The Hague Invasion Act.\" It is so named because it would allow the president to order the US military to \"rescue\" American officials and military personnel, as well as allied officials, including Israel, being held in ICC custody in the Hague.\n\nIn defense of Israel, the United States has been willing to violate its own laws, as well as international laws. The Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act, for example, establish provisions governing military sales to foreign consumers and governments.\n\nSection 502(B) of the Foreign Assistance Act prohibits security assistance to \"any country the government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\" Despite Israel's merciless onslaught in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, the United States has provided an additional $15 billion in unconditional military aid to Israel.\n\nSuch US practices have tarnished what remains of its international stature.\n\nIn yet another effort to please the pro-Israel lobby, silence criticism of Israel and shutdown protests, Congress, on 30 April, passed the Antisemitism Awareness Act, which broadens the legal definition of antisemitism to include the \"targeting of the State of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity.\" If signed into law, opposing Zionism and criticizing Israel would qualify as antisemitism.\n\nAccording to 320 members of the House of Representatives who voted for H.R. 6090 (91 opposed), Israel alone is above criticism. In addition, the proposed legislation would violate the right to free speech enshrined in the first amendment to the US Constitution.\n\nAbetted by the United States, Israel's sacrosanct logo emblazoned across the American political, economic and military landscape has allowed it to amass power, be absolved from judgment and to carry out, unimpeded, genocide in Gaza today.\n\nOn the international stage, the United States has had a long history of providing absolution and cover for Israel's crimes against humanity in Palestine. Since 1972, it has cast its veto 53 times in the United Nations Security Council against resolutions or condemnations critical of Israel.\n\nIn Washington's latest move to dash Palestinian hopes for some semblance of self-determination, the United States, on 18 April 2024, vetoed a Security Council resolution recommending full membership in the United Nations for the State of Palestine. The administration did so while concomitantly professing to be conducting diplomatic efforts to create a Palestinian state when the carnage ends.\n\nUnlike student protestors and their allies who know that there can be no business as usual as long as genocide in Gaza continues, the United States, however, presses on as though Israel, in its present form, has a future in the Middle East.\n\nProponents of a \"Free Palestine\" are aware that their advocacy may come at an economic cost and a police record. A price many are willing to pay especially when they have two worthy examples to draw on.\n\nRachel Corrie, a 23-year old college student from Olympia, Washington, was crushed to death by an Israeli army bulldozer as she tried to prevent the demolition of a Palestinian home in Rafah on March 16, 2003.\n\nCorrie's legacy has endured in Palestine. Mothers and fathers have named their daughters after her and olive trees have been planted in her name. Evergreen State College, where she was a student, is the first US university to completely divest from Israel.\n\nAaron Bushnell, an active duty member of the US Air Force, was 25 years old when he self-immolated on February 25, 2024 outside the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. His last words as the fire consumed him were \"Free Palestine.\"\n\nBefore self-immolating, Bushnell said, \"I am about to engage in an extreme act of protest. But compared to what people have been experiencing in Palestine at the hands of their colonizers - it's not extreme at all. This is what our ruling class has decided will be normal.\"\n\nOfficials in the Palestinian city of Jericho announced on March 10, 2024 that they had named a street in his honor, as they had for Rachel Corrie in Ramallah in the West Bank.\n\nNineteen Americans were awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Biden in May 2024. Even if they had lived, it is doubtful that Rachel Corrie and Aaron Bushnell would have been chosen. Both gave their lives in order that Palestinians might finally live free.\n\nThe desire to return and reclaim their homes have kept Palestinian hopes alive for 76 years. For all that time they have had few allies.\n\nThey have now realized an ally in the worldwide Palestinian solidarity movement. Through their actions, American students have demonstrated that they understand what many in positions of authority do not - that it is a duty, an obligation in and to democracy to resist unjust laws and unjust policies.", "source": {"uri": "palestinechronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Palestine Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unite the Right rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settler_colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settler colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scorched earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Virginia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likud", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Likud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Student activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

But the Zionist regime not only has refused to do this, but also the war machine of Netanyahu keeps advancing and currently Rafah is another central point indicting the barbaric crimes of this regime.\n\nSince a few days ago, reports have been released on the media based on the imminent issuance of a verdict of guilty for Netanyahu and other officials of the Zionist regime. Netanyahu has been under unusual pressures about the likely issuance of subpoena.\n\nNetanyahu has started efforts to prevent the issuance of subpoena with special concentration on the Joe Biden administration. It seems very unlikely that the officials of the Zionist regime are surprised with the possible verdict of the ICC.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hebrew language media have admitted that the possible issuance of warrant arrest by the ICC in The Hague will seriously concern Netanyahu, the Zionist regime prime minister.\n\nOffice of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the ICC a few days ago, saying that it is aware of the official and unofficial concerns related to the investigation of this body on the war in Gaza, stressed the continuation of this investigation.\n\nThis office, issuing a statement, called for halting of every effort to obstruct, intimidate or affect the ICC officials and reiterated that independence and neutrality of the ICC will be weakened once there is a threat of revenge against it or its officials.\n\nThe OTP also emphasized that any threat against it, even without taking a measure, according to the Rome Statute, may be a crime against execution of justice.\n\nEarlier, too, informed sources had announced that the ICC prosecutor had met and talked with the personnel of hospitals al-Shafa in the North and Nasser in the South of the Gaza Strip.\n\nAccording to these sources, which spoke under the condition of anonymity, the events occurred in these hospitals will be annexed to other investigations carried out by the ICC on war crimes, crimes against humanity, crime of aggression and genocide in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIt seems that the measure of lawyers in South Africa and the Netherlands will be a role model for lawyers of other countries whereby to increase pressure on Netanyahu and his regime to, ultimately, entrap them and stop their carnage machine./Pars Today", "source": {"uri": "avapress.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This isn't just a minor faux pas; it's a brazen display of political muscle-flexing, where the stakes are not just reputational but resonate deeply with the very principles of international justice and law.\n\nThe letter warns with an unnerving clarity: \"Such actions are illegitimate and lack legal basis, and if carried out will result in severe sanctions against you and your institution.\" Here, the senators don't just disagree with the ICC's potential actions; they brand them as illegitimate, casting a dark shadow over the court's autonomy and its mandate to uphold international law.\n\nAs the letter continues, the threat escalates: \"Target Israel and we will target you. If you move forward with the measures indicated in the report, we will move to end all American support for the ICC, sanction your employees and associates, and bar you and your families from the United States.\" This is no mere diplomatic protest; it's an outright intimidation tactic, suggesting a readiness to punish not just the institution but its individuals and their families.\n\nThe senators' assertions bring to light a deeply troubling question: are they positioning the United States on a precipice, teetering towards behaviors associated with states that openly defy international norms? The letter does not merely express a position but seems to coerce, suggesting that the ICC must either align with a specific political viewpoint or face dire consequences.\n\nSuch rhetoric could be perceived as echoing darker times when governments would openly reject international agreements and laws that did not suit their ends. The senators' language - \"The United States will not tolerate politicized attacks by the ICC on our allies\" - frames the ICC's judicial activities as attacks, rather than the functions of an international body working to uphold the rule of law.\n\nThe implications of such a stance are profound. It challenges the very essence of international law, which is built on the premise that justice is blind to politics and power. By threatening the ICC with severe repercussions, the letter risks not only undermining the court's credibility but also eroding the global commitment to a just and lawful international order.\n\nThis scenario isn't just a diplomatic skirmish over differing views on justice; it's an alarming indication of how high the stakes have become. In this heated exchange, the world watches and waits: Will the ICC fold under pressure, or will it stand its ground, affirming that true justice is not subject to the whims of powerful states? The question then becomes: Is the United States nearing the point of becoming a rogue state, governed by those who are complicit in money laundering and genocide? - May 8, 2024.\n\n* Che Ran reads The Malaysian Insight.", "source": {"uri": "themalaysianinsight.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "themalaysianinsight.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intimidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rogue state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/images/default.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545985", "eventUri": "eng-9545985", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

If the rumors materialize, the move will cause substantial damage to Israel's international standing, as well as limit the movement of the people subject to the warrants. If issued, the warrants would not reflect any genuine or legitimate suspicion that a crime has actually been committed, but rather, the warrants would be just another milestone achieved by the Palestinian leadership - the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA) - to delegitimize Israel and politicize the court.\n\nWhile the ICC is ostensibly a supranational judicial forum, experience has shown that in its efforts to appease the Palestinians and vilify Israel, the court has been willing to disregard facts and the law and even make decisions lacking any jurisdiction.\n\nIn the case of the ICC, Israel's fight is more political than legal. Accordingly, the measures that Israel must take to deflate the threat posed by the ICC are political. Identifying and adopting the right move could entirely remove and negate the current threat and all future threats.\n\nThe ICC is a special court that functions on the basis of state accession. Israel was an active participant in promoting the establishment of the court. Still, after the court's foundational statute was hijacked and politicized to single out Israel specifically, the decision was made that Israel would not join the court.\n\nSo, if Israel is not a party to the court, how is the court considering wielding jurisdiction?\n\nRegarding the United Nations, Israeli statesman Abba Eben famously quipped, \"If Algeria introduced a resolution declaring that the earth was flat and that Israel had flattened it, it would pass by a vote of 164 to 13 with 26 abstentions.\"\n\nIn 2012, the Palestinian leadership - the PLO and the PA - petitioned the United Nations to recognize the \"State of Palestine.\" While no such state actually exists, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) decided to grant \"Palestine\" the status of a Non-Member Observer State.\n\nAccording to the UN Charter, the UN can only admit a new state if nine (including all five permanent members) of the 15 members of the UN Security Council recommend doing so, and that recommendation is adopted by two-thirds of the states who are members of the UNGA. The UNGA's decision to grant \"Palestine\" the special status, which is shared only by the Holy See, circumvented these fundamental requirements.\n\nNonetheless, the Palestinian leadership then used the politically driven fallacy created by the UNGA decision, which referred to \"Palestine\" as a state, to join the ICC.\n\nAfter being accepted to the court, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas established a committee that included members of Hamas, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and other internationally designated terror organizations to engage the court. Since then, the terror committee has closely cooperated with the ICC prosecutor, submitting hundreds, if not thousands, of complaints and reports. At one stage, the PLO/PA boasted that the terror committee had met on more than 80 occasions with the office of the Prosecutor.\n\nThe Palestinian efforts bore fruit in December 2019, when the ICC Prosecutor announced that \"following a thorough, independent and objective assessment of all reliable information available to my Office... I am satisfied that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation into the situation in Palestine.\" There was just one problem.\n\nWhen actual states are accepted into the UN, those states have clear borders. However, since \"Palestine\" does not really exist, it lacks any border. This raised the question of the court's territorial scope regarding the non-existent state. In other words, before proceeding with the investigation, the Prosecutor first had to establish what geographical area should be seen as \"Palestine,\" in which there would then be an investigation into the crimes that had allegedly been committed therein.\n\nRelying on a list of politically motivated resolutions of the UN General Assembly that have no legal value and a cacophony of other convoluted arguments, the ICC Prosecutor suggested that the court recognize Judea, Samaria, east Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip as the territory of \"Palestine.\"\n\nDespite fundamental flaws and objections to the Prosecutor's position, including a brief submitted by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs together with other organizations, the majority decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC, without any jurisdiction to do so, ruled that the fictional \"State of Palestine\" actually exists and that its borders are equivalent to the \"Occupied Palestinian territory.\"\n\nThe term \"Occupied Palestinian territories\" never appeared in any UN resolution between 1948 and 1967. Evidently, the areas in question, Judea, Samaria, east Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, that were occupied by Jordan and Egypt, respectively, do not appear to have been \"Palestinian territories\" until they were liberated by Israel in 1967. \"Palestine,\" based on the reasoning of the court, is the only country in the world that did not exist before it was \"occupied.\"\n\nIn other words, to pander to the Palestinians and potentially drag Israelis before the ICC, the prosecutor and the court were willing to adopt factual and legal positions devoid of any basis, recognizing a state that does not exist and inventing its geographical territory in explicit contradiction of multiple legally binding documents.\n\nJoining the UN and the ICC were a Breach of the Oslo Accords\n\nThe Oslo Accords, a generic name for several agreements between Israel and the PLO from September 1993 through September 1995, are the fundamental framework that defines the relations between Israel on the one hand and the PLO/PA on the other. The agreements, which gave rise to the Palestinian autonomous rule over certain areas in Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, were temporary in nature and left many subjects open for further discussion as part of the \"permanent status\" negotiations.\n\nWhile Israel never agreed that the still-open \"permanent status\" negotiations would give rise to a Palestinian state, the PLO has done its utmost to persuade the world to force the creation of the Palestinian state on Israel.\n\nPetitioning the UN to admit \"Palestine\" as a state was a fundamental breach of the Oslo Accords and one of the few commitments the PLO took upon itself since it would have prejudged the outcome of the negotiations. Joining the ICC as a means to attack and delegitimize Israel further compounded the breach.\n\nAs part of the Oslo Accords, Israel agreed to waive substantial tax income in favor of the newly created PA. The idea was that the tax income would provide the PA with a stable income on which it could rely. According to the agreements, Israel collects the tax income on behalf of the PA and transfers it every month.\n\nBased on information provided by the Israeli Ministry of Finance in response to a request under Israel's Freedom of Information Law, the PA income from these taxes rose from 4.8 billion shekels in 2010 to 11.3 billion shekels in 2022.\n\nAccording to financial reports published by the PA Ministry of Finance, from 2016 through 2022, the taxes collected by Israel accounted for 65-68% of the PA's entire annual net revenue and 75-79% of the PA's annual tax revenue.\n\nWhile Israel waived the income so that the PA would use the funds to further the goals of the Oslo Accords for the benefit of the Palestinians and to prevent incitement to terror and violence and combat terror, in practice, the PLO/PA uses the funds to bankroll all of its practices that breach the Oslo Accords.\n\nThus, on average, for the years 2016 through 2022, out of every 100 shekels the PLO/PA spent on its terror rewarding \"Pay-for-Slay\" policy, it received 65-68 shekels from Israel; out of every 100 shekels the PA spent on incitement to terror and the murder of Jews, it received 65-68 shekels from Israel; and out of every 100 shekels the PA spent on attacking Israeli leaders and IDF soldiers in the ICC, it received 65-68 shekels from Israel.\n\nFrom the outset, the PLO/PA has breached every single one of the commitments it made in the Oslo Accords. These breaches include actively inciting, incentivizing, and rewarding terror and joining international organizations as the \"State of Palestine.\" While the PLO/PA has systematically disregarded their commitments, Israel has continued to collect and transfer billions of shekels a year to the PLO/PA.\n\nThe reality created is analogous to a person buying a house. Every month, the purchaser pays the seller the total compensation for the house, and every month, the seller refuses to vacate the house and transfer it to the buyer.\n\nIn the Oslo Accords, Israel bought peace from the PLO/PA. Every month, Israel pays the PLO/PA for that peace. Every month, the PLO/PA responds with terror and violence, whether it be physical or legal violence.\n\nSince the PLO/PA/\"State of Palestine\" joined the ICC, Israel has been on the defensive, trying to use predominantly legal arguments to stave off the impending disaster. While these efforts are commendable and should continue as a means to present Israel's legal arguments to the world, considering the inherent bias of the ICC, they would appear to be insufficient.\n\nFor years, Israel's leaders and IDF personnel have lived under the ever-darkening ICC threat. While masquerading as a legal threat, in reality, the ICC-Palestinian case is a political threat.\n\nAs Israel provides 65%-79% of the PLO/PA's annual income, as presented above, the PLO/PA should never have been allowed to petition the UN for fictitious statehood and should certainly not have been allowed to join the ICC.\n\nWhile the political threat of the ICC plowing forward with its biased investigation and ultimately issuing arrest warrants has been hanging over Israel for years, Israel avoided using its political and financial leverage to solve the problem.\n\nSince the threat now appears to be metastasizing from a theoretical option to a real scenario, and since Israel has wasted valuable time allowing this threat to gather impetus, it must immediately make clear to both Palestinians and their supporters that time has run out.\n\nTo avoid substantial damage to Israel if the ICC issues the arrest warrants, Israel must cut the threat off at its roots. To do this, Israel should give the PLO/PA an ultimatum: choose adherence to the Oslo Accords and their ensuing funds from Israel or choose unilateralism, the UN, and the ICC, and lose all the funds from Israel. The PLO/PA must inform the UN that it waves its fictitious status and that the non-existent \"State of Palestine\" is withdrawing from the ICC or face the full force of the political and financial consequences.\n\nIsrael cannot be expected to continue funding its own demise.\n\nWhenever the idea of adopting measures that could potentially bring about the demise of the PLO/PA is raised, stakeholders and commentators question what alternatives to the PA exist. This is, of course, a fundamental question whose answer is well beyond the scope of this report. A microcosm of this question is now being discussed regarding the fate of the Gaza Strip in the aftermath of the October 7 massacre. While nothing has yet been set in stone, Israel's government has repeatedly declared that the PLO/PA will have no further role in the Strip.\n\nNotwithstanding this position, for the purposes of this report, it is no less relevant to first hear the response of the PLO/PA to the ultimatum. If the PLO/PA opts to immediately reform its behavior and cease and desist from its nefarious practices, the requirement to consider alternatives would be avoided. If, on the other hand, the PLO/PA adheres to its current path, opting for terror, death, and destruction over the path of peace, it will have clearly shown Israel and the international community that it has outlived its function and should be disbanded in favor of almost any other option.", "source": {"uri": "jcpa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs"},

"TEHRAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Nasser Kanaani on Thursday condemned the threats by a group of U.S. lawmakers against the International Criminal Court (ICC) intending to prevent the tribunal from issuing arrest warrants against senior Israeli officials.\n\nHe made the remarks in a post on social media platform X while reacting to warnings by pro-Israel U.S. congressmen that any arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials would encounter U.S. retaliation.\n\nKanaani also slammed recent threats by a number of U.S. Republican senators against the ICC to impose sanctions should the tribunal take any such action.\n\nThe spokesman said that through \"exerting pressure\" on the ICC, these U.S. congressmen sought to grant Israeli officials and military commanders immunity for their \"war crimes\" against Palestinians, which is a \"shameful and worrying\" move.\n\nHe described the threats as \"ugly interferences\" that would set a \"dangerous precedent\" for contradicting the ICC's \"objectives and philosophy of prosecuting and punishing war criminals.\"\n\nIsrael's military said on Tuesday that it had started \"a precise counterterrorism operation\" in Rafah city in the south of the Gaza Strip and assumed \"operational control\" over the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, a vital point for humanitarian aid to enter the enclave.\n\nThe development in Rafah is the latest escalation in the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict that has persisted for seven months in Gaza. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn",

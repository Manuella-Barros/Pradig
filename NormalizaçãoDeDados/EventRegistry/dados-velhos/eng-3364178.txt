Will her second film live up to the hype? Here is our Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review.\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi Cast: Kriti Sanon, Ayushmann Khurrana, Rajkummar Rao\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi Director: Ashwini Iyer Tiwari\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi Rating: (3/5)\n\nFrom Badrinath Ki Dulhania to Toilet: Ek Prem Katha, if 2017 has taught us anything, it is that films with a hinterland connect are increasingly striking a chord with the audience. The latest addition to the club is a delightful comedy of errors generously sprinkled with small-town humour, Bareilly Ki Barfi.\n\nBitti Mishra (Kriti Sanon) is a spunky, cigarette-smoking, break-dancing girl, who sticks out like a sore thumb in the small town of Bareilly. With two broken engagements and countless rejections, finding a groom for her seems like Mission Impossible. Just when a hopeless Bitti is running away from home, she comes across Bareilly Ki Barfi, a trashy novel that seems to be written about her. If the author finds her quirks endearing, he must be the one for her, she reasons.\n\nTrouble is, the novel was written by Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann Khurrana) after getting his heart broken. Not wanting to defame his beloved by using his own name, he credited his friend, Pritam Vidrohi (Rajkummar Rao), as the author. When Bitti comes looking for Pritam, Chirag loses his heart to her. So what does he do? He trains Pritam to be the kind of man that Bitti will instantly dislike, but things don't quite go according to plan.\n\nThe strength of Bareilly Ki Barfi is its cast. Kriti Sanon's bohemian small-town-girl act is a far cry from her usual fare, but she pulls it off with aplomb. Ayushmann Khurrana looks effortless as the jilted aashiq trying to win over the woman of his dreams by hook or by crook. But it is Rajkummar Rao who steals the show as the timid salesman turned \"rangbaaz\".\n\nIf you thought that Rajkummar can do justice to only serious roles, he proves that he can pull off a comic role with just as much elan. The supporting cast deserves a special mention. Casting the charming Pankaj Tripathi and Seema Pahwa as Bitti's parents was a stroke of genius.\n\nIt would have been very easy to show the characters as one-dimensional stock types, but writers Nitesh Tiwari (writer and director of Dangal) and Shreyas Jain give us fully fleshed-out real people with a charm of their own. Bitti's mother echoes all our mothers when she laments, \"Raat bhar ghumti rehti hai. Ladki hai, koi chudail thodi hai.\" Perhaps the only flaw is the inconsistency in Rajkummar's character.\n\nThe songs are likeable, with the romantic Nazm Nazm and the catchy Sweety Tera Drama standing out the most in the album.\n\nAfter Nil Battey Sannata, director Ashwini Iyer Tiwari brings us another engaging watch. There is no dull moment in the film. Light and fluffy, Bareilly Ki Barfi is no heavy seven-course meal, but it is quite the delicious dessert.\n\nALSO READ: Dangal director Nitesh Tiwari opens up on writing Bareilly Ki Barfi\n\nALSO READ: 5 reasons we cannot wait for Kriti-Ayushmann-Rajkummar's Bareilly Ki Barfi\n\nALSO WATCH: When the cast of Bareilly Ki Barfi visited the sets of Ishqbaaz", "id": "9883653", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review: Kriti-Ayushmann-Rajkummar's film is delightfully sweet", "image": "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/bkb-story_647_081817040740.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jainism"}, "id": "323558", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Romance film"}, "id": "332398", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dangal (film)"}, "id": "1273818", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangal_(film)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 312, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Casting, Molding, Machining", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Casting,_Molding,_Machining"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 573, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 575, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 577, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News_and_Media"}], "time": "11:38:00"}

Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari's films are like her -- simple and real. She made an impact with her directorial debut, Nil Battey Sannata, which won critical acclaim. Her creative genius has found an ideal partner in husband Nitesh Tiwari, who too, delivered a solid punch at the box office with his directorial venture, 'Dangal'. And now, the two have joined hands for the second time on 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' -- she as the director and he, as the writer. With the film, produced by Junglee Pictures and BR Studios hitting the screens this Friday , BT caught up with Ashwiny and had an interesting conversation about her journey as a filmmaker, her equation with her husband and why 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' will leave you with a sweet aftertaste. Excerpts...\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi' revolves around an ordinary family in Uttar Pradesh. Your directorial debut 'Nil Battey Sannata' also offered a glimpse of reality. What attracts you to slice-of-life stories?\n\nThey are simple, relatable stories. 'Nil Battey Sannata' spoke of a certain class of people and their social dichotomies; it found takers across the board because emotions are universal. 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is all about love and a bunch of real, happy people. Love doesn't mean being mushy and running around trees. We've attempted a story where apart from romance, we have delved into beautiful equations between a girl and her parents. And like real people, even the characters in this film have their quirks, eccentricities and flaws. Such characters attract me because they add fun to the story without making it look laboured.\n\nYour husband (Nitesh Tiwari) has his roots in Uttar Pradesh. How did you familiarise yourself with its landscape and culture, which are integral to the film's narrative? Did Nitesh's presence as the writer help you in that regard?\n\nI always do extensive research on my films. So, before I started shooting, I spent a lot of time in Lucknow and Bareilly. I met many local boys and girls, observed them and even photographed them to understand their way of dressing, mannerisms and body language. During one of my trips, I actually found two boys who looked like Rajkummar (Rao) and Ayushmann (Khurrana)'s characters in the film. That apart, Nitesh and his co-writer Shreyas Jain are North Indians. While Shreyas is a well-travelled guy from Madhya Pradesh, Nitesh has spent a considerable amount of time in UP and MP. So, yes, their presence made a lot of difference to the way the characters were fleshed out. At the same time, a lot of work happens after a film is written. The set, the look of the characters and their chemistry have to be bang on to bring out the essence of the script.\n\nAs a working mother, with two kids at home, did you find it tough to stay away, especially since 'Bareilly Ki Barfi's' schedules were longer than those of your first film, 'Nil Battey Sannata'?\n\nIt doesn't matter how long I've had to stay away from home. My sentiments will never change. I'm always assured that Nitesh is around, but maa toh maa hoti hai. Having said that, women should work, become independent, and follow their passions. In the bargain, children also become independent and more respectful of their mother and her time. They understand that their mother is also ambitious and they learn to value her presence in their lives. I have also realised that children accommodate a lot. They adjust with what you give them, which is also right -- they should mould their lives and needs around their parents the way their parents do for them.\n\nBoth Nitesh and you are creative people. Do you ever end up having 'creative differences'?\n\nI don't think there will be creative differences between us, there will only be healthy discussions. While Nitesh is a strong writer, I'm good at art. I can probably do a screenplay well, but his strength lies in drafting the entire film on paper. So, we have each other's back, and we work on our plus points. Having a writer at home, I feel a sense of ease while talking about an idea because we both know that we will not judge each other. A bouncing board at home is a privilege. 'Nil Battey Sannata' happened over a cup of morning chai. Similarly, 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is an idea we cracked on a vacation. It's a connection that happens instantly. We can work with outsiders, but there will always be a time lapse there.\n\nSo, you do take Nitesh's presence for granted?\n\nOf course, I do. I don't feel guilty about it. He is my bouncing board and will always be, no matter who we work with. When I get ideas, I message him and I don't care where he is, and likewise for him. He gets confused with colours and artwork and he asks me to chip in, which I do. We don't have anyone else to go to. We may get bugged temporarily, but it's the comfort that draws us to just fall back on each other's shoulders.\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is just two days away from release. Considering the fact that this is just your second film, are you feeling anxious?\n\nI can't deny that there's pressure, but I will feel so even after I have made my tenth film. I doesn't matter how many films you make. You are only as good as your last film. I feel a sense of responsibility for the money people will spend to watch my film; I don't want to let them down. That's the reason I treat every film as my debut. I don't let the fear of failure rule my mind when I am working because it distracts me. However, after I've made a film, I'm anxious about audience's reaction.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "id": "9349565", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari: Like real people, the characters in 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' have their quirks and flaws - Times of India", "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-60072884/60072884.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "51434", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Madhya Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "53284", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Madhya Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "53310", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "North India"}, "id": "323415", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jainism"}, "id": "323558", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barfi"}, "id": "566242", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barfi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sannata"}, "id": "566844", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sannata"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dangal (film)"}, "id": "1273818", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangal_(film)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nitesh Tiwari"}, "id": "1282154", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitesh_Tiwari"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}], "time": "20:02:00"}

The refreshing and pleasing storyline has got everyone hooked to witness the drama that unfolds in this small town set film.\n\nWhat has got everyone intrigued is the lead character of the film, 'Bitti'. As we learned from the trailer, Bitti is a rebel. The bold, vibrant, chirpy girl is often termed as outspoken too. The small town girl with big dreams is not the ordinary Bareilly girl. Bitti does break dance, smokes cigarettes and sometimes even drinks alcohol.\n\nThe BTS video of 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' showcases how Kriti Sanon became Bitti. It also gives us more insights into the life of Bitti.\n\nKriti Sanon expressed her views on Bitti saying, \"I completely love Bitti, she a little chhurrat, bindass, bratty.\"\n\nFrom the video, we learn that Bitti works at the electricity department.\n\nDirector Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari talked about how she got the Bitti out in Kriti Sanon, \"I told her one thing, just be yourself, and just be as you are at home. How you stay, how you live, how you eat, the little things.\" She further added how she got Bitti to be a simple girl, \" We hardly made her hair. We told her if you have to go out and you just have to tie a pony tail, how would you do it. She showed how I said that's exactly what you need to do in the film as well.\"\n\nTalking about the character, Kriti Sanon further added, \"The only problem in Bitti's life is, she isn't getting married. That's not her problem, that's her mother's problem. She (Bitti) doesn't want to just get married to anybody. She wants that one person who loves her the way she is.\"\n\nRevealing what exactly 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is, the book, as well as the character, the actress, said, \" While she's reading that book, that author is talking about a girl who is exactly like her. But he's talking in a very good manner, in a very positive manner so she feels there's at least somebody who feels that how ever she is, she is good and that's how the chase starts and the story unfolds.\"\n\nThe film also stars Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkummar Rao. Ayushmann's character Chirag Dubey owns a printing press and Rajkummar as Pritam Vidrohi is a saree vendor.\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is a slice of life film with an unusual love triangle. The content of the film looks promising with its intriguing plot and appealing presentation.\n\nThe trailer of the film has got everyone hooked and the music of the film is winning hearts. The songs 'Sweety Tera Drama', 'Nazm Nazm' and 'Twist Kamariya' are ruling charts.\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is the collaborative effort between Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, creative producer Juno Chopra and writer Nitesh Tiwari of Dangal fame and Shreyas Jain.\n\nNitesh Tiwari and Shreyas Jain contributed to a power packed script to Juno Chopra's sphere headed execution while Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari captured perfect frames.\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi' brings to celluloid for the first time the team of Kriti Sanon, Ayushmann Khurrana, and Rajkummar Rao. The film is Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari's second film as a director.\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi is produced by Junglee Pictures and BR Studios. The film is scheduled to release on 18th August 2017.\n\nWATCH VIDEO:\n\nTrending Video\n\nWatch video: Esha Gupta takes her love for fruits to the next level in these hot posts!\n\nDownload the new mid-day android app to get updates on all the latest and trending stories on the go https://goo.gl/8Xlcvr", "id": "9445579", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Watch Kriti Sanon unleash her Bitti avatar - Entertainment", "image": "http://images.mid-day.com/images/2017/jun/Kriti-Sanon-aa-l.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3290, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3306}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "55019", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jainism"}, "id": "323558", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dangal (film)"}, "id": "1273818", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangal_(film)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}], "time": "09:37:00"}

What ingredients have gone into making Bareilly Ki Barfi?\n\nKriti: I didn't know about this book at all. It's basically a line which they loved that they took from a book.\n\nThe script was reworked from that idea.\n\nIt's not that if you read the book and watch the film, it's the same thing.\n\nAyushmann: It's the basic germ, not the entire story.\n\nThe characters in the film, the bizarre situations and how they eventually get their love, it's about that.\n\nIMAGE: Ayushmann and Kriti in Bareilly Ki Barfi.\n\nThe trailer reflected the UP flavour.\n\nKriti: Absolutely. Bareilly Ki Barfi has that UP flavour which sometimes is by-the-way-funny, not in your face.\n\nThere are situations that turn out to be comical and there's a lot of drama.\n\nThere's a lot of relatability with every character, be it three of us (Ayushmann, Rajkummar Rao and Kriti) or Seema Pahwa or Pankaj Tripathy.\n\nYou will see the nuance.\n\nThere are comparisons being drawn between Bareilly Ki Barfi and Saajan.\n\nAyushmann: It can be compared to any love triangle film, but the thing is, the director and the writer bring a lot to the table.\n\nThe treatment is different.\n\nShe (Ashwiny) comes from a school of Nil Battey Sannata.\n\nThe writer of the film, Nitesh Tiwari, made Dangal. So you can see the kind of cinema they have done and how they will treat the film.\n\nThat will make the film different.\n\nAyushmann, you play an aggressive guy for the first time.\n\nYes, this is the first time I am play a bully. I have never done that in real life.\n\nAs part of growing up, of course, you get bullied by kids. But I haven't done it in a film.\n\nBut he's not an outright bully or a schemer. He's probably selfish, but he has his vulnerable moments.\n\nIMAGE: Ayushmann, Kriti and Rajkummar Rao in Bareilly Ki Barfi.\n\nKriti, you made your debut opposite Mahesh Babu in 1: Nenokkadine. Did you get any more offers in Tollywood or do you want to stick to Bollywood?\n\nI did another film post Heropanti, Dohchay, but after that, I don't want to do things just for the heck of it.\n\nYou need to have enough time to be able to give your hundred percent to a film.\n\nI have been busy enough here, but if I get something interesting, be it in any language, I will take it up.\n\nWhat's the most endearing and challenging part about your characters?\n\nAyushmann: The most endearing part of this character is that he has a good relationship with his mother. There's an undertone of love and callousness at the same time.\n\nThe challenging part is that Chirag is not a likeable character and yet, he's vulnerable.\n\nSo how does one toe that thin line? And, he has to take the story forward.\n\nHe has all the funny lines in the film.\n\nKriti: The most endearing part of Bitti is the relationship she shares with her father (played by Pankaj Tripathy).\n\nI don't think it has been seen in Indian cinema before especially when the girl comes from a small town like Bareilly.\n\nYou will even see a scene where the father and daughter smoke together.\n\nHe understands her and trusts her completely. He's protective about her.\n\nHe's the kind of father who knows she is not going to do anything wrong, but at the same time, at night, he will be at the door waiting for her to come back.\n\nThe most challenging part is that when you get a character who is so moophat, so outspoken, and she is occasionally smoking and drinking too, does break-dance too, it's very important to ground that character.\n\nIt's important to make people feel for her character and not just have this bubbly character going on.\n\nThey need to feel what she goes through and what she actually wants from life.\n\nIMAGE: Ayushmann, Rajkummar and Kriti with director Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari. Photograph: Kind courtesy Kriti Sanon/Instagram\n\nWhen the story is established in a small town, we tend to make the accent caricaturish.\n\nAyushmann: It depends on the director and the school of thought you are coming from.\n\nIn this particular film, we are very true to the region in Bareilly and Lucknow, people talk like that. In India, after every 10, 12 km, the accent changes.\n\nWe had a language coach, Rohit Chaudhary.\n\nHe acts in the film too. He plays my best friend.\n\nKriti: If you talk about dialect, it also changes with your education.\n\nSomeone who is very educated will have a polished way of speaking Hindi.\n\nIn this film, Bitti and Chirag speak in a similar manner whereas Rajkummar's character isn't as educated. So he speaks closer as to how my parents (in the film) speak.\n\nAyushmann, for the first time, you are doing a film with two heroes. How was your reel and real chemistry with Rajkummar Rao?\n\nIt is always fun to work with somebody your age.\n\nOn set, there was this give and take, but off set, we were very friendly.\n\nOn set, sometimes, I would bully him.\n\nThen, there would be his character transformation and he would get back at me.\n\nHow long does it take for a dialect to fade off?

Ever since the time the film had got announced, it has been making news for all the right reasons.\n\nThe makers of Bareilly Ki Barfi are leaving no stone unturned to ensure the success of the film at the box office. Recently, the film's makers had sent a box of sweets to many leading media publication houses. The USP of these sweet boxes were that the sweets were termed as the film's name itself 'Bareilly Ki Barfi'. As a step further in the direction of the film's promotions, the makers have now released a series of short videos from the film which shows the film's makings.\n\nThe video, which has been titled as 'Making of Chirag's Character', has the film's lead star Ayushmann Khurrana speaking about his character Chirag Dubey, who owns a printing press in Bareilly. By his own confession, Ayushmann Khurrana said that his character was a smart alec and a bully of sorts, who bullies his friend Pritam (Rajkummar Rao). Since Ayushmann Khurrana has played sweet and simple characters in his career so far, he found the character of Chirag Dubey very intriguing. Adding more to Ayushmann Khurrana's character, the film's director Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari said that he plays a manipulative character with a slightly dominating aura, which is unlike him in real life. She added that, even while shooting the scenes wherein he had to shout, he used to feel bad after the shot because he does not shout in real life.\n\nOn the other hand, the video titled 'Making of Bitti's Character' is about the film's female lead Kriti Sanon and her character in the film 'Bitti'. Mincing no words while describing her character, Kriti Sanon said that Bitti happens to be a clean hearted girl who is a little bindaas and bratty with a modern day outlook and who smokes secretly and drinks alcohol. She earns her livelihood by working in the electricity department. The biggest problem of her character is that she is finding it difficult to find a suitable match for her because she wants to get married to the person who will understand her. Suddenly, she starts finding resonance with the character of the book that she is reading titled 'Bareilly Ki Barfi'.\n\nThere's another video which has the film's cast and crew eating their way to glory. The video has Ayushmann Khurrana saying that Bareilly Ki Barfi was like a food for him because he just cannot stay without eating. Through the making of the film, he got himself treated to delicacies like laddoo, Barfi, and jalebi. He even made a candid confession that besides the script, it was the food which made him love the film. Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon also revealed an unknown fact that the veteran actress Seema Pahwa was a 'compulsive cook', just like Milind Soman who is a compulsive jogger.\n\nTrending :\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi stars Ayushmann Khurrana, Kriti Sanon and Rajkummar Rao in the lead roles.

'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is just two days away from release. Considering the fact that this is director Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari's second film after the critically-acclaimed 'Nil Battey Sannata', we wonder if she's anxious. \"I can't deny that there's pressure, but I will feel so even after I have made my tenth film. I doesn't matter how many films you make. You are only as good as your last film. I feel a sense of responsibility for the money people will spend to watch my film; I don't want to let them down. That's the reason I treat every film as my debut. I don't let the fear of failure rule my mind when I am working because it distracts me. However, after I've made a film, I'm anxious about audience's reaction.\"\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi' revolves around an ordinary family in Uttar Pradesh. Her directorial debut, 'Nil Battey Sannata', also offered a glimpse of reality. When asked what attracts her to slice-of-life stories, Ashwiny elaborates, \"They are simple, relatable stories. 'Nil Battey Sannata' spoke of a certain class of people and their social dichotomies; it found takers across the board because emotions are universal. 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is all about love and a bunch of real, happy people. Love doesn't mean being mushy and running around trees. We've attempted a story where apart from romance, we have delved into beautiful equations between a girl and her parents. And like real people, even the characters in this film have their quirks, eccentricities and flaws. Such characters attract me because they add fun to the story without making it look laboured.\"\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "id": "9254925", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari: I don't want to let the audience down. - Times of India", "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-60072771/60072771.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "51434", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sannata"}, "id": "566844", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sannata"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}], "time": "10:28:00"}

But that isn't meant as criticism. It is a largely inoffensive, mildly diverting small-town romance that generally hits the right buttons thanks primarily to a crisp and lively screenplay, earthy dialogues and effortless acting by a fine cast. If not exactly scintillating, it is definitely entertaining enough not to fritter away its inherent advantages.\n\nIndeed, Bareilly Ki Barfi isn't the kind of film that will sweep you off your feet, but there is sufficient charm and chutzpah in this effervescent brew to keep you invested all the way through. There is indeed something to be said about a Bollywood romantic comedy that lays so much store by its script, its relatable setting and believable characters. The creative choices the director makes reflect amply in the final outcome.\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi Movie Review: A still from the film\n\nIt does not ride on crowd-pulling stars. It does not need to because it reposes its faith unwaveringly and squarely in a lively story of secret love and deliberate subterfuge and props it up with light touches and the weighty talent of a bunch of actors who are endowed with the natural ability to breathe life into everyday situations with minimum visible effort.\n\nThe stars of the show are Rajkummar Rao (in the guise of an unassuming young man who is pushed around too easily until he decides to take a stand) and Pankaj Tripathi (as the endearingly broad-minded father of a rebellious girl who thinks nothing of throwing caution to the wind in the conservative boondocks). Seema Pahwa, playing a sedate matriarch, is perfectly clued in to the spirit of the story and the setting.\n\nNot that the two actors who get top billing, Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon, are overshadowed by the aforementioned trio. The former does a convincing job of mutating from a brooding jilted lover to a crooked manipulator who puts his own interests above everyone else's. The burden of making Bareilly Ki Barfi work rests upon Kriti Sanon and she doesn't put a foot wrong.\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi Movie Review: A still from the film\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi is a loose adaptation by Nitesh Tiwari (the writer and director of Dangal) and Shreyas Jain from French writer Nicolas Barreau's 2012 English-language novel, The Ingredients of Love. The story is transported to the small Uttar Pradesh town of Bareilly where the emotions and aspirations of the young clash head-on with the entrenched traditions and mores.\n\nWith Javed Akhtar providing an amusing voiceover narration, the film takes us into the world that pulsates inside Mishra Sadan, Ekta Nagar, Bareilly. This is home to sweetmeat shop owner Narottam Mishra (Pankaj Tripathi), his wife Sushila (Seema Pahwa) and only daughter Bitti (Kriti Sanon).\n\nHer father allows Bitti Mishra - she works in the customer complaints department of the state electricity board - all the freedom that she craves for, including an occasional swig and a smoke. Her schoolteacher-mother, infinitely more orthodox, is more intent on finding a suitable boy for her daughter.\n\nKriti is a natural born rebel, loves breakdance, watches English movies and makes absolutely no concessions to the norms that society lays down for a middle class girl like her. When a potential husband asks her if she is a virgin, she shoots back: \"Are you?\" It makes no difference if I am a virgin or not, replies the boy, but you better be one. \"I am not a virgin,\" says Bitti. The guy is put in his place, end of chapter, and it's absolutely no skin off Bitti nose.\n\nBitti's exasperated mother is often at her tether's end and bemoans her luck: \"Harkate laundo wali karti hai, is sey toh achcha beta hi paida ho jaata\". The girl's response, in a heart-to-heart chat with her sympathetic father, is: \"Ladki hona na disaster hai ekdum.\" Much later in the film, the mother wonders: \"Raat raat bhar ghumti rehti hai. Ladki hain koi chudail thodi hai.\" Nothing can stop Bitti in her tracks.\n\nShe runs away from home, boards a train to nowhere in particular, and, during the trip that she eventually aborts, chances upon a novella titled Bareilly Ki Barfi. It changes her life. The heroine in the story is exactly like her and Bitti falls under the spell of the unknown writer Pritam Vidrohi (Rajkummar Rao). She seeks the help of printing press owner Chirag Dubey (Ayushmaan Khurrana) to locate the author.\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi Movie Review: A still from the film\n\nChirag, himself coming off a failed love affair, traces the man to Lucknow, where he is now sari salesman. He brings the writer back to Bareilly with the intention of ensuring that Bitti rejects him outright. Chirag has developed feelings for Bitti but is unable to profess his love to her. Matters begin to spin out of his hand when the diffident Pritam, hiding behind a fake voice and demeanour, worms his way into Bitti's heart. Desperate measures spark more complications as Bitti's best friend and neighbour Rama (Swati Semwal), whose terrace is where the heroine hones her breakdance moves, is pulled into the frame.\n\nFor all the energy that Bareilly Ki Barfi exudes, it never quite lifts itself above its featherweight category. But that is barely a disqualification. If anything, it keeps the film chugging along at an even pace, its tongue-in-cheek levity preventing it from being sucked into sticky sweetness.\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi is definitely worth a watch provided you do not expect the world from it. It is happy to be what it is: a modest barfi from nondescript Bareilly. A bite wouldn't be a bad idea.", "id": "9860382", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Bareilly Ki Barfi Movie Review: Kriti Sanon Makes This Sweet Concoction Work", "image": "https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-08/bareilly-ki-barfi-instagram_650x400_41503045959.jpg?ver-20170702.1", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "51434", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "53310", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bollywood"}, "id": "312308", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jainism"}, "id": "323558", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Romance film"}, "id": "332398", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pankaj Tripathi"}, "id": "800555", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Tripathi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dangal (film)"}, "id": "1273818", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangal_(film)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Seema Bhargava"}, "id": "1440464", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seema_Bhargava"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 573, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 575, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 577, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News_and_Media"}], "time": "08:52:00"}

She wants that one person who loves her the way she is.\" 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is undoubtedly one of the most awaited films of the year. The refreshing and pleasing storyline has got everyone hooked on to witness the drama that unfolds in this small town set film.\n\nWhat has got everyone intrigued is the lead character of the film, 'Bitti'. As we learned from the trailer, Bitti is a rebel. The bold, vibrant, chirpy girl is often termed as outspoken too. The small town girl with big dreams is not the ordinary Bareilly girl. Bitti does break dance, smokes cigarettes and sometimes even drinks alcohol.\n\nThe BTS video of 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' showcases how Kriti Sanon became Bitti. It also gives us more insights into the life of Bitti.\n\nKriti Sanon expressed her views on Bitti saying, \"I completely love Bitti, she a little chhurrat, bindass, bratty.\"\n\nFrom the video, we learn that Bitti works at the electricity department.\n\nDirector Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari talked about how she got the Bitti out of Kriti Sanon, \"I told her one thing, just be yourself, and just be as you are at home. How you stay, how you live, how you eat, the little things.\" She further added how she got Bitti to be a simple girl, \" We hardly made her hair. We told her if you have to go out and you just have to tie a pony tail, how would you do it. She showed how I said that's exactly what you need to do in the film as well.\"\n\nTalking about the character, Kriti Sanon further added, \"The only problem in Bitti's life is, she isn't getting married.

She wants that one person who loves her the way she is.\"\n\nRevealing what exactly 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is about, the book, as well as the character, the actress, said, \"While she's reading that book, that author is talking about a girl who is exactly like her. But he's talking in a very good manner, in a very positive manner so she feels there's at least somebody who feels that how ever she is, she is good and that's how the chase starts and the story unfolds.\"\n\nThe film also stars Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkummar Rao. Ayushmann's character Chirag Dubey owns a printing press and Rajkummar as Pritam Vidrohi is a saree vendor.\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is a slice of life film with an unusual love triangle. The content of the film looks promising with its intriguing plot and appealing presentation.\n\nThe trailer and the music of the film are winning hearts. The songs 'Sweety Tera Drama', 'Nazm Nazm' and 'Twist Kamariya' are ruling charts.\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is the collaborative effort of Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, creative producer Juno Chopra, writer Nitesh Tiwari and Shreyas Jain.\n\nNitesh Tiwari and Shreyas Jain contributed to a power-packed script to Juno Chopra's sphere-headed execution while Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari captured perfect frames.\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi' brings to celluloid for the first time the team of Kriti Sanon, Ayushmann Khurrana, and Rajkummar Rao. The film is Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari's second film as a director.\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is produced by Junglee Pictures and BR Studios.

The comedy film enveloped in a tale of romance between three individuals is apparently like a breath of fresh air.\n\nHere are a few reasons why we would recommend this film for this weekend:\n\nThe film has brought together Ayushmann Khurrana, Kriti Sanon and Rajkummar Rao for the first time. With two male leads and one heroine, it is certainly a love triangle. The trailer had dropped ample hints about the plot. But who wins the ladylove's attention is something for us to watch.\n\nRepresentation of a heroine in a refreshing way\n\nAccording to India.com Bitti (played by Kriti) \"is a free-spirited young girl who finds her small town of Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh too small for the lifestyle she dreams of\". She is someone who smokes cigarette, does break-dance and watches English films. She is in search of a man who would accept her as she is. So, here comes a film that portrays a lead character in an atypical way. This somewhat reminds us of the adorable Tanu (played by Kangana Ranaut) in 'Tanu Weds Manu'.\n\nExtremely gifted actors on board\n\nAll the three lead actors are extremely gifted. They can essay almost any character effortlessly. Their performances in the mighty impressive 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' trailer and in their past films are proof good enough.\n\nRealistic story\n\nAccording to India.com, \"'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is the simple, sweet love story that tugs at your heartstrings sans any sentimental drama. The romance is real as are the emotions of the characters involved.\"\n\nFilm a product of two marvellous filmmakers\n\nBKB has been penned by Nitesh Tiwari, the man who directed a mega blockbuster film like 'Dangal' and directed by acclaimed filmmaker Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari of the 'Nil Battey Sannata' fame. It is obvious that they would deliver a film that has some uniqueness.\n\nSo if you are wondering how to make the most of your weekend, grab your ticket and head to the nearest screen.", "id": "9818205", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Bareilly Ki Barfi: Reasons to watch the film", "image": "http://ste.india.com/sites/default/files/2017/08/18/617561-bkb-song.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "51434", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "55019", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Romance film"}, "id": "332398", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tanu Weds Manu"}, "id": "335164", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanu_Weds_Manu"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kangna Ranaut"}, "id": "346947", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangna_Ranaut"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Love triangle"}, "id": "470855", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_triangle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dangal (film)"}, "id": "1273818", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangal_(film)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nitesh Tiwari"}, "id": "1282154", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitesh_Tiwari"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}], "time": "03:56:00"}

The film is all about a Bareilly based bubbly girl Bitti Mishra (Kriti Sanon) and her life. Despite being a girl, her parents raise her up as a son. That explains the reason as to why her parents are not surprised to know that her daughter smokes and even drinks. Even though Bitti Mishra meets many suitors for her marriage, she lands up getting rejected by everyone. That's why her marriage becomes the prime concern of her parents (Seema Pahwa and Pankaj Tripathi). One day, a chance reading about the central character of a book titled 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' not only changes her plans of running away from her parental home, but also, makes her feel special about the book's author, who, she thinks is the only person who has understood her completely.\n\nWhen the book's printer Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann Khurrana) gets to know about Bitti Mishra's love for the book's author, he fabricates a story involving Pritam Vidrohi (Rajkummar Rao), whose name and photograph features as the book's author. What is the mystery behind the book's author, does Kriti Sanon get to know the real author of the book in the end and what connection does Ayushmann Khurrana has with the book, is what forms the film.\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi is inspired from a French novel titled 'Ingredients of Love'. The film's writer very skilfully and convincingly adapts the said book into the film's script and changed the premise of the story from France to Uttar Pradesh. Even though the film has been inspired by the book, the film's director Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari has ensured that the film enjoys an identity of its own, without falling under the shadows of the book. Thanks to the able direction by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, the film makes for a decent watch.\n\nThe flipside of the coin is that, the film's length acts as a villain at handful most of the places. While the first half gets dragged at many places as it starts moving around in circles, it's the second half which paces things up for the film. Chopping off a few unnecessary scenes (in the first half) could have done wonders for the film.\n\nEssentially, the film belongs to Kriti Sanon, who is fast becoming one of the front runners of the Gen-Next stars. Even though her last film Raabta failed to live upto the expectations, that hasn't deterred her determination and confidence even a bit. Her performance in the film in the film is convincing. She looks true to her character.\n\nOn the other hand, there's Ayushmann Khurrana, who was last seen in Meri Pyaari Bindu. After having played romantic heroes so far in his career, this is the first time Ayushmann Khurrana is playing such a character, although we won't reveal the details of his character (you have to see it to believe it). Overall, Ayushmann Khurrana is good in this film.\n\nBesides Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon, the film belongs to Rajkummar Rao, whose last film was Behen Hogi Teri. He is a man who simply owns the film and how. There seems to be no stopping this man when it comes to experimenting with characters and mannerisms. Bareilly Ki Barfi only reaffirms the fact that why Rajkummar Rao is one of the most effortless actors in Bollywood today. His onscreen chemistry with both, Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon is really awesome. With the kind of roles and films which he has in his kitty in the days to come, Rajkummar Rao is definitely a superstar in the waiting. The ease with which Rajkummar Rao changes not just his character sketch, but also his voice in the film, deserves a loud applause.\n\nThe veteran actors Seema Pahwa and Pankaj Tripathi make for an endearing watch. Both are simply adorable in their respective characters in the film. The way in which they have handled their screen spaces is definitely praise worthy.\n\nAshwiny Iyer Tiwari, the director of Bareilly Ki Barfi, made a splash in Bollywood with her debut film Nil Battey Sannata, a film which not only won awards galore, but also everyone's hearts alike. Even though she tried to do the same with Bareilly Ki Barfi, the sad part is that, she succeeds only to a certain extent. The semi weak screenplay gives in the film at a handful of places. At the same time, her direction in the film is definitely something to watch out for. One has to give it to this lady for having extracted the best performances from her lead cast. Do not miss the scenes when Ayushmann Khurrana imparts training to Rajkummar Rao.\n\nAs far as the music of the film is concerned, there are a couple of songs which makes for good listening.

Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review: This Rajkummar Rao, Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon film works in fits and startsThere is not much difference between Kriti Sanon and her Bareilly Ki Barfi character Bitti. Here's the proofSushant Singh Rajput claims Bareilly Ki Barfi is Kriti Sanon's best performance so far\n\nActor Kriti Sanon, who essays a girl-next-door in Bareilly Ki Barfi, says that just to prove one's acting talent, an artiste has to take up a de-glam role. While the actor received a lot of praise for her glamorous look and beautiful screen presence when it comes to her performance as an actor, she did not receive any positive review from the critics.\n\nAsked about such opinion about her acting skill, Kriti said, \"Yes, the general perception still is that if you have a pretty face, you are a bad actor. In fact, I was also told in my initial days that there are no flaws in my appearance to look real. You still have to play a de-glam role to prove your acting skill.\"\n\nKriti says it's unfair. She added, \"I think as an audience, for me, what interests me is how layered the character is, if there is some complexity in her character that could engage me to watch. Perfection of her appearance has got nothing to do with her personality, right?\"\n\nHowever, she believes that such things happened also depending on the fate of the film. \"Overall, if the film and your character connect with the audience, then people also notice your performance. Having said that, I know that critics start noticing our performance beyond the beauty when playing a so-called 'de-glam' role.\"\n\nKriti is playing Bitti Mishra, a girl from Uttar Pradesh, who has a contemporary outlook in Bareilly Ki Barfi. According to the Dilwale actor, she can connect to the character very easily. \"Though Bitti is from a small town, she is a broad-minded girl. She questions every regular thing like why can't girls do this or that; she is a very rational minded person. I am also like her and that is why I could connect with her so much,\" she said.\n\nHowever, there is dissimilarity, Kriti added. \"She wants a man to get married to, who can accept her the way she is, more than anything else. When it comes to me, love has to happen to get married\" she said. This is the first time Kriti has worked with actors Ayushmann Khuranaa and Rajkummar Rao in the Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari directorial.\n\nShe said, \"Since they come from a theatre background, their approach towards a character is quite similar and that helped me to enhance my performance; because acting is also about reacting to your co-actors.\"\n\nFor all the latest Entertainment News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Kriti Sanon", "id": "9887560", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Bareilly Ki Barfi actor Kriti Sanon: You have to play a de-glam role to prove your acting skill", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/kriti-7591.jpg?w=759", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 30, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 45}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "51434", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "55019", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajput"}, "id": "354909", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajput"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dilwale (2015 film)"}, "id": "1279958", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilwale_(2015_film)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 426, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 713, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 749, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice Actors", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice_Actors"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 936, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Agents and Agencies", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Agents_and_Agencies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1023, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Circus", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Circus"}], "time": "12:04:00"}

Clearly, the film was made keeping the iconic song in mind, except with an alliterative 'barfi' not a 'jhumka' in mind.\n\nThis Small-Town Rom Com ticks all the boxes going in: perky girl armed with requisite quirky parents, a couple of suitable boys, and great one liners. And it does work in fits and starts, but it flattens equally in between. The thing with dreaming up smart lines, and there are some quite wonderfully flavoursome ones in here, is that sometimes entire scenes get written just to be able to include the punch-lines: this 'mithai' has several such sequences, and make the run-time flabby.\n\nOne fine day, Bitti Mishra (Sanon) pronounced, quite properly Misra, by the 'h' dropping Bareilly-walas, sets her heart on meeting a mysterious someone who seems to know her inside out. Local printing press owner Chirag (Khurrana) is smitten. And then arrives a guy who goes by the name of Pritam Vidrohi (Rao) who is the fly in the ointment. Or is he? Will the new entrant surge ahead? Who will win the fair maiden?\n\nAmong the good things about this film is the superb supporting cast: Tripathi, who's much too young to play the leading lady's father, does a good job of being Bitti's papa, who's more like a pal than a pa. Pahwa scores another ace after Aankhon Dekhi: what a lovely actress she is.\n\nThe two actors who play the best friends, one who accompanies Khurrana, and the other who is seen with Sanon, are pitch perfect. They show up the problems that Sanon has with merging into her part: she tries hard to the be the small-town girl who likes a couple of puffs on the side, and who break dances for fun, but the effort shows.\n\nThe plot's contrivances come in the way of Khurrana's playing of Chirag fully credibly. As does Rajkummar Rao, who blows away the weaknesses of this film with his consummate act, playing the timid 'chota shehari' on the one hand, and the loud 'rangbaaz' on the other.\n\nRao sweetens the pot, and makes up for the rest of it.

The refreshing and pleasing storyline has got everyone hooked to witness the drama that unfolds in this small town set film.\n\nWhat has got everyone intrigued is the lead character of the film, 'Bitti' played by Kriti Sanon. As we learned from the trailer, Bitti is a rebel. The bold, vibrant, chirpy girl is often termed as outspoken too. The small town girl with big dreams is not the ordinary Bareilly girl. Bitti does break dance, smokes cigarettes and sometimes even drinks alcohol.\n\nThe BTS video of 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' showcases how Kriti Sanon became Bitti. It also gives us more insights into the life of Bitti. Kriti Sanon expressed her views on Bitti saying, \"I completely love Bitti, she's a little chhurrat, bindass, bratty.\"\n\nFrom the video, we learn that Bitti works at the electricity department. Director Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari talked about how she got the Bitti out in Kriti Sanon, \"I told her one thing, just be yourself, and just be as you are at home. How you stay, how you live, how you eat, the little things.\" She further added how she got Bitti to be a simple girl, \"We hardly made her hair. We told her if you have to go out and you just have to tie a pony tail, how would you do it. She showed how I said that's exactly what you need to do in the film as well.\"\n\nTalking about the character, Kriti Sanon further added, \"The only problem in Bitti's life is, she isn't getting married. That's not her problem, that's her mother's problem. She (Bitti) doesn't want to just get married to anybody. She wants that one person who loves her the way she is.\"\n\nRevealing what exactly 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is, the book, as well as the character, the actress, said, \"While she's reading that book, that author is talking about a girl who is exactly like her. But he's talking in a very good manner, in a very positive manner so she feels there's at least somebody who feels that how ever she is, she is good and that's how the chase starts and the story unfolds.\"\n\nThe film also stars Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkummar Rao. Ayushmann's character Chirag Dubey owns a printing press and Rajkummar as Pritam Vidrohi is a saree vendor.\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is a slice of life film with an unusual love triangle. The content of the film looks promising with its intriguing plot and appealing presentation.\n\nThe trailer of the film has got everyone hooked and the music of the film is winning hearts. The songs 'Sweety Tera Drama', 'Nazm Nazm' and 'Twist Kamariya' are ruling charts. The film is Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari's second film as a director.\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi is produced by Junglee Pictures and BR Studios.

But does the film manage to thoroughly entertain us? we aren't sure.\n\nIn 'Bareilly Ki Barfi', Sanon (Bitti) plays a middle-class girl, who after repeated rejections from prospective grooms, sets her heart on Pritam Vidrohi (Rao) after reading a book authored by him. Chirag (Khurrana) is the only one who can help her connect with this lesser-known writer. At the behest of Chirag, Pritam dons the act of an arrogant semi-goon whom she is destined to hate. But instead of 'depressing' her, he ends up 'impressing' her.\n\nWhat follows is an open challenge between the boys to marry the lady in question. There are sequences in the film, particularly the second half, showcasing a tug-of-war between the boys to lure the girl. But whom will she finally end up with is highly predictable. Clearly, your guess is as good as mine!\n\nThe film is directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, whose debut 'Nil Battey Sannata' was critically acclaimed. Add to that, the film is co-written by 'Dangal' director Nitesh Tiwari along with Shreyas Jain. Obviously, our expectations were high with a stellar team at work, but the film seems like an opportunity lost as much more could have been achieved.\n\nThe first half of the film is crisply edited and the movie moves at a pace that keeps you hooked. The second half might be predictable but doesn't seem like a lengthy affair.\n\nAs expected, Rao outshines the other lead characters, although Khurrana tries to engage us, playing the lovelorn character - however, the former steals the show as he switches from being a shy, simpleton saree salesman to a character gone 'rogue'.\n\nKriti doesn't do much in her life, expect for being interested in weighing her options (boys) and planning to settle down - something her mother also wants. Although she questions the traditional role of girls in society, has a smoking buddy in her father but her character hardly comes across as progressive.\n\nAlthough she claims to be a break dancer, she never breaks into any 'break dance' moves and can be seen twisting her waist to Indian dance numbers. The song in the films are typically small-town baarat (wedding) numbers that have been shot and choreographed well.\n\nWe would like to make a special mention of Pankaj Tripathi, who plays the Sanon's father - and has time and again proved his acting abilities. He adds to the mad comedy in the film.\n\nOverall, 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is a light-hearted film that leaves one asking for more.\n\nSaid that, if you don't have any plans this weekend, grab a ticket and go watch this popcorn entertainer.\n\nDirector: Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari\n\nAyushmann Khurrana, Rajkummar Rao and Kriti Sanon\n\nRating: 2.5/5\n\nPlaying in theatres in UAE.", "id": "9741630", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "'Bareilly Ki Barfi' review: Not as sweet as expected", "image": "http://www.khaleejtimes.com/storyimage/KT/20170817/ARTICLE/170819140/AR/0/AR-170819140.jpg&NCS_modified=  &imageversion=1by1&exif=.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dance"}, "id": "306425", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jainism"}, "id": "323558", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sari"}, "id": "373552", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tiwari"}, "id": "390158", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pankaj Tripathi"}, "id": "800555", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Tripathi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dangal (film)"}, "id": "1273818", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangal_(film)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}], "time": "17:13:00"}

During a chat with indianexpress.com, trade analyst Girish Johar said, \"It is too early to talk about Bareilly Ki Barfi. The film has opened on a low note. It has not been up to the mark. I am expecting it to reach the Rs 3 to Rs 4 crore mark on Friday,\" he said.\n\n\"If the reviews are good and critics give the right kind of ratings to the film, then maybe it can earn enough by this weekend,\" he added.\n\nGirish Johar also explained that Bareilly Ki Barfi has to compete with two films this week. Akshay Kumar's Toilet: Ek Prem Katha and the Hollywood release Annabelle: Creation. \"Toilet: Ek Prem Katha will obviously be a strong contender for them (Bareilly Ki Barfi) this week. Maybe not Partition: 1947, because Gurinder Chadha's film is for a very small segment of the audience. The Hollywood release Annabelle: Creation has a good brand recall. It also has a strong fan base,\" he said.\n\n\"In the coming week, Akshay Kumar's Toilet: Ek Prem Katha will be leading the box office, followed by Bareilly Ki Barfi and then Annabelle: Creation,\" he added.\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi will mark Kriti Sanon's second film this year after Raabta opposite Sushant Singh Rajput. It will also mark Rajkummar Rao's third film, after Trapped, Behen Hogi Teri and Raabta.\n\nFor all the latest Entertainment News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Ayushmann Khurrana Kriti Sanon Rajkummar Rao", "id": "9895474", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Bareilly Ki Barfi box office prediction: Kriti Sanon, Rajkummar Rao and Ayushmann Khurrana's film opens on a low note", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/bareilly-ki-barfi-kriti-sanon-rajkummar-rao-ayushmann-khurrana-759.jpg?w=759", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 49, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 64}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "54715", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sushant Singh Rajput"}, "id": "466241", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushant_Singh_Rajput"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 577, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News_and_Media"}], "time": "12:48:00"}

It's beautiful and a different experience for me because I have always played sweet, simple boys on screen.

They're so personal.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the actor retweeted a post, \"I wish Haruki Murakami would write the rest of my life.\" When told that even an acclaimed surrealist like the Japanese writer would find it difficult to change his squeaky-clean image, Ayushmann said that his personal life is pretty uneventful, devoid of bar brawls and controversies to fill the pages of a biography.\n\ni wish Haruki Murakami would write the rest of my life. -- Xeina Almsallam (@MeetHavoc)\n\n1502736918000\n\n\"Three years ago, I was in London for a concert and Murakami had a lecture the next day around the same time that I was leaving. I had to miss it and its one of my life's biggest regrets. I know I'll meet him one day. There's always a woman in his books who vanishes only to appear again. He describes her from her fingernails to her earlobes. If you ask me, he's the truest romantic!\" the actor said.\n\nAyushmann and Kriti attend Umang Festival 2017125Ayushmann and Kriti attend Umang Festival 2017Bollywood stars Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon pose for the lensman as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann KhurranaAyushmann Khurrana is all smiles as he promotes his film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana pose for the lensman as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti SanonKriti Sanon poses for the lensman as she promotes her film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti SanonKriti Sanon arrives to promote her film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "id": "9623041", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Ayushmann Khurrana: I am a sucker for old-school romance -

Explored and imagined in every possible permutation, the construct can't stray away from the inevitable: boy meets girl, girl meets another boy, both boys vie for girl's attention and eventually, her heart melts for one and condenses the other's. The equation furnished here isn't much different, but the stunts and shenanigans the curiously-crafted leads partake in, makes this a cute date film. .\n\n\"He doesn't have any bad habit. He is a good boy. He is a typical 'Raja-beta' - a good boy, focused, doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, doesn't have non-vegetarian, talks in a good way.

Here's all that you need to know about this meethi daastan:\n\nRajkummar Rao, Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon headline the cast along with Pankaj Tripathi and Seema Pahwa. While Rajkummar plays the double-toned Pritam Vidrohi, Ayushmann plays Chirag Dubey. Kriti essays the role of Bitti, a girl who loves break-dance, lives life on her own terms and has dreams bigger than her small-town of Bareilly. She shares an interesting equationg with her parents, played by Pankaj and Seema in the film.\n\nKriti, who has only played urban characters in her films so far, will be seen as a small-town girl for the first time. It's also Ayushmann's first attempt at playing a character with grey shades. Rajkummar's Pritam Vidrohi is a character which will surprise you with a variety of emotions.\n\nWhile the film has a solid a star cast to boast about, the soundtrack of the movie is an interesting mix. Songs like 'Sweety Tera Drama' (sung by Pavni Pandey, Shraddha Pandit, Dev Negi and Pravesh Mallick) and 'Twist Kamariya' (sung by Harshdeep Kaur, Yasser Desai, Tanishk and Altamash) will get you on dance floor for some latkas and jhatkas, and the soulful 'Nazm Nazm' (sung by Arko), will melt your heart.\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is true labour of love. It's directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, who debuted with the critically-acclaimed 'Nil Battey Sannata'. The movie has been written by her husband, Nitesh Tiwari (director of superhit, 'Dangal') and Shreyas Jain. The film, which captures small-town life beautifully, revolves around a semi-urban family and their relationships, quirks, beliefs -- all portrayed realistically, with a strong dose of humor.\n\nThe film is an adaptation of the French book, 'Ingredients of Love', which Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari chanced upon during a trip. While adapting the story, its setting was changed to UP.\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi', produced by Junglee Pictures and BR Studios, releases on August 18.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "id": "9557671", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Here's a taste of 'Bareilly Ki Barfi'... - Times of India", "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-60088330/60088330.jpg?48810", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 2335, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2344}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jainism"}, "id": "323558", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pankaj Tripathi"}, "id": "800555", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Tripathi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dangal (film)"}, "id": "1273818", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangal_(film)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}], "time": "20:15:00"}

In Bareilly Ki Barfi, Kriti's character as Bitti strives to break this stereotype.\n\nWhile talking about the issue Kriti shares, \"Smoking is not good for health and should be avoided. I am a non-smoker, but the point we want to make is that girls who smoke, who are fond of body art or break into a jig are not characterless. Our society has a very small bracket for 'good girls'. That bracket needs to broaden up or change. When a guy is moophat or smokes, he is not considered characterless, but you judge girls too fast. This is seen more in smaller towns. In an arranged marriage too, only a girl is asked all kinds of questions. I really want this to change.\"\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi is touted as the tastiest entertainer of the year. The trailer of the film and the songs have created immense anticipation amongst the audiences.

The actors, while savouring the mithai, recalled memories of shooting the Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari-directorial -- produced by Junglee Pictures and BR Studios, and written by Nitesh Tiwari (who helmed the blockbuster 'Dangal') -- in Bareilly and parts of Lucknow.\n\nNeedless to say, one of the highlights of the shoot was the cast and crew gorging on delicacies wherever they shot. Kriti, who plays a small-town, bindaas girl in the movie, told us, \"We enjoyed lots of malpua, rabdi and samosas from the local shops while shooting, particularly in Lucknow. It was amazing.\"\n\nHer co-star Ayushmann jumped in and added, \"We had a lot of chaat from Sharma Ki Chaat. We sampled tunde kebabs and travelled across Lucknow. Every lane had something special to offer.\" When Kriti asked her co-stars why she wasn't a part of these gastronomical explorations, Rajkummar smirked, \"Tu kaam kar rahi thi. Tere scenes chal rahe the.\" On a serious note, he added, \"I was the only one having tofu on the set; I couldn't eat anything else at that time. However, that didn't stop me from venturing out once in a while to sample some local khaana.\"\n\nApart from treating their palates to different tastes, the actors even shot at a halwai store. Reason? Kriti's father in the film, played by Pankaj Tripathi, is a sweet shop owner. \"It was a different experience shooting at a halwai's kitchen. We had a lot of fun doing those scenes,\" said Ayushmann. Kriti elaborated, \"Before 'Bareilly Ki Barfi', I had never worked on a film where I was told to eat to my heart's content. Here, I was allowed to eat whenever I wanted.\"\n\nThe actors shot the film in 50 days on real locations in Bareilly and Lucknow. When asked what would be the one experience they'd take home with them, Ayushmann laughed and replied, \"This was one film where every other scene required us to eat scrumptious food. Even if we were not required to eat, food was definitely a part of the scene.\" For Kriti, apart from food, the pace of the shoot also stood out. \"This is my quickest film. Prior to this, I've never completed a film in just 50 days,\" she said.\n\nDescribing his experience, Rajkummar said, \"The best part of the film was shooting at real locations with a great team. \"I had a chance to play a character with diametrically different dimensions, which is a rarity. That experience will stay with me.\"\n\nTalking of real locations, Kriti recalled shooting at Bareilly's modest homes, which have two terraces. \"Chhat ke upar chhat! In cities, we don't get to see two terraces in a single house. While shooting, we'd always have fans watching us from their terraces. Unko bhagana padta tha, which was a little heartbreaking, but they were very sweet and cooperative,\" she remembered, adding, \"But there was a stray incident when we were shooting on the street and someone threw a packet of dahi from their house. It landed on one of the assistant directors and it splashed on Ayushmann.\"\n\nThe entire team of 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' stressed on the fact that a lot of effort has gone into making the film look and feel as realistic as possible -- whether in the locations, costumes, dialogues or the characters played by each of them, including the supporting cast.\n\nAfter getting a taste of a tray full of mithai, we asked the trio if the memorable experience of making this film has made them friends for life. Or will they remain food buddies, at least? On an emotional note, Rajkummar answered, \"Look, we might not have the time to meet every other day, but whenever we meet, hamare beech wahi barfiwali mithaas hogi. The equation will always be there.\"\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi', produced by Junglee Pictures and BR Studios, releases today.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "id": "9767929", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Savour thrice the sweetness with Bareilly Ki Barfi - Times of India", "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-60103977/60103977.jpg?56420", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "53310", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "55019", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kebab"}, "id": "309596", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebab"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yogurt"}, "id": "319391", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogurt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samosa"}, "id": "356186", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samosa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chaat"}, "id": "374795", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tiwari"}, "id": "390158", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "South Asian sweets"}, "id": "462061", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asian_sweets"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barfi"}, "id": "566242", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barfi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pankaj Tripathi"}, "id": "800555", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Tripathi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malpua"}, "id": "825712", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malapua_(dessert)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dangal (film)"}, "id": "1273818", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangal_(film)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 362, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting"}], "time": "20:01:00"}

'Tanu Weds Manu' had its female lead actress characters name in the title and with 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' Kriti's onscreen name Bitti is used as a synonym to 'Barfi'.\n\n2) Unabashed female characters: Kriti Sanon and Kangana Ranaut both play the character of a modern free spirited woman. Both are bold, rebel, vibrant, strong headed. Kriti and Kangana both are seen smoking cigarettes and drinking liquor and dance to their hearts\n\n3) Small town: 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' and 'Tanu Weds Manu' are deeply rooted in the interiors of the country. 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' is set in the small town of Bareilly and similarly, 'Tanu Weds Manu' is set in Kanpur, both falling in the state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\n4) Breaking marriage stereotypes: While small towns tend to be more inclined towards arrange marriages, the films 'Tanu weds Manu' and 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' showcase liberal views by giving the lead actresses the freedom to choose their own bridegrooms.\n\n5) Critically acclaimed male leads: 'Tanu Weds Manu' gave us an interesting portrayal of Manu by R Madhavan, 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' gives us two power packed performers in Rajkummar Rao and Ayushmann Khurrana. The films are backed by critically acclaimed male actors.\n\n6) Quirky songs: Both the films have given us chartbuster songs and good music. 'Sadi Gali' and 'Yun Hi' from 'Tanu Weds Manu' are still a favourite of listeners while 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' has given the listeners amazing songs like 'Sweety Tera Drama', 'Twist Kamariya', and 'Nazm Nazm' which have been loved by one and all.\n\n7) Directors: The directors of both the films Anand L Rai and Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari are known to make rooted films, which have been critically acclaimed and loved by the audiences.\n\n8) Budget: 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' and 'Tanu Weds Manu' are both made on modest budget.\n\nWhile 'Tanu Weds Manu' received an exceptional response from the audience for its content, 'BKB' is striking the right chords with the masses for its deep rooted appeal. We just can't wait for the film's release to watch the hit formula recreated with writers Nitesh Tiwari & Shreyas Jain storyline.\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi' features Kriti Sanon alongside Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkummar Rao in the lead.\n\nThe film is written by Dangal's writer director Nitesh Tiwari and Shreyas Jain.\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi is Ashiwny Iyer Tiwari's second film as a director and the film has created a lot of right noise, and her direction has been praised by everyone.\n\nJuno Chopra is the creative producer who has been involved with all aspects of the film.\n\nThe collaborative effort between Ashiwny Iyer Tiwari, creative producer Juno Chopra and writer Nitesh Tiwari of Dangal fame and Shreyas Jain has worked very well.\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi is produced by Junglee Pictures and BR Studios.", "id": "9675741", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "'Bareilly Ki Barfi' brings the hit formula of 'Tanu weds Manu' : Kriti Sanon", "image": "http://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/8/17/w600X390/rajkummar_rao.JPG", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "51434", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "52726", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "K\u0101npur"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "53789", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanpur", "label": {"eng": "K\u0101npur"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bollywood"}, "id": "312308", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jainism"}, "id": "323558", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tanu Weds Manu"}, "id": "335164", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanu_Weds_Manu"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kangna Ranaut"}, "id": "346947", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangna_Ranaut"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "R.

Ayushmann Khurrana has been cast opposite to Kriti and he is playing the role of Chirag Dubey, who is the owner of a printing press and wants to woo Kriti.\n\nRajkummar Rao is playing the role of a 'kabab mai haddi' in their story.

Leaving is always the last option. Actors choose films but every film has its own destiny and it chooses you. Sometimes, you end up signing a film at the last minute and there are times when a film you've signed takes too long to roll and you cannot do it anymore. I believe whatever happens, happens for good and I'm not let down by any of my decisions.\n\nKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg in MumbaiThe 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' team -- Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon -- visited NM College on the weekend to meet students at their college festival, Umang.\n\nYour last two releases, 'Dilwale' and 'Raabta ' , but both didn't quite manage to live up to expectations at the box-office. Do you think this has directly impacted the kind of opportunities coming your way\n\nI'm a positive person and only looking out for opportunities to keep growing as an actor. I cannot handle marketing or choose a film's release date. When I sign a film, I'm doing it because I love the script and look forward to working with the team creating it. I also believe that if a film doesn't work but you've done your job well, it's better than a film, in which you couldn't do justice to your part, doing extremely well. That can cause greater harm.\n\nYes, sometimes the behaviour of some people can change towards you after a Friday, but I'm not focussing on that. I strongly believe that I will become stagnant the day I sit back and feel satisfied about my career.\n\nWhat is your coping mechanism for setbacks\n\nWhen I'm feeling low, pressurised or anxious, and feel like I need pampering, my extremely supportive family comes to the rescue. Sometimes, I sit with friends who're not from the film industry because I feel the need to not discuss work. Taking holidays refreshes my mind, makes me a better actor too.\n\nA lot is riding on the success of the Junglee Pictures and BR Chopra production,'Bareilly Ki Barfi', which also features Rajkummar Rao and Ayushmann Khurrana. Do you think the audience will connect with your character Bitti? How similar are you to her?\n\nI've led a protective, middle-class life. I was studious and never went on any adventures before I entered the film industry. I relate to 'Bitti' in thought but not in her actions. She's more tomboyish than me. I cannot pretend to be someone I am not; my Dilliyat invariably comes out! But both of us constantly question cultural norms. Bitti has a line in the film, 'Hum ladka hote toh problem hota kya', which resonates with me. Both Bitti and I don't follow the whole 'acchi ladkiyan yeh nahi karti' diktat. However, 'Bitti' has absolutely no filter, while I do. I'm straight forward but practical.\n\nWhat are the filters you speak of?\n\nOn social media, people make all sorts of nasty comments on your personal and professional life and if you're reading through it, it's bound to affect you. So I don't think twice before blocking people, and I do it quite often. My filters block out all negativity.\n\nIn 'Bareilly Ki Barfi', 'Bitti' unwittingly friend-zones 'Chirag'...\n\nI'm sure girls do it all the time in real life too! There's always this guy in every group who has feelings for you but you just don't feel the same way. My advice in such cases is, don't go looking for love. It's got to find you. As women, we want to be treated in a certain way and sometimes there's a really sweet guy who really loves you and you end up feeling something too. That's a trap, don't fall for it. Those relationships never last.\n\nAyushmann and Kriti attend Umang Festival 2017125Ayushmann and Kriti attend Umang Festival 2017Bollywood stars Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon pose for the lensman as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana shake a leg as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti SanonAyushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Ayushmann KhurranaAyushmann Khurrana is all smiles as he promotes his film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana pose for the lensman as they promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti SanonKriti Sanon poses for the lensman as she promotes her film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti Sanon and Ayushmann KhurranaKriti Sanon and Ayushmann Khurrana promote their film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.Kriti SanonKriti Sanon arrives to promote her film 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' at Mithibai College's Umang Festival 2017 on August 13, 2017.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "id": "9423691", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Kriti Sanon: I don't think twice before blocking people -

Not only is this Rao's richest comedic performance, his presence or absence onscreen lifts and depresses the proceedings. Bareilly Ki Barfi isn't devoid of interest -- that was never likely, given that it's directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari (Nil Battey Sannata), written by Nitesh Tiwari (Dangal) and Shreyas Jain, and features the underrated Ayushmann Khurrana and the sublime Pankaj Tripathi. But it lacks bite, which Rao, playing a rather toothless individual, supplies.\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi begins with a travelling overhead shot (which can be linked to the voice-of-god narration that continues through the film), before zooming in on one particular household, where confectionary store owner Narottam (Tripathi) is asking his wife, Sushila (Seema Bhargava), where his cigarettes have gone. Busy with her prayers, she tells him to ask their daughter -- a neat exploding of two minor taboos in one go. It turns out Bitti (Kriti Sanon) doesn't have her father's cigarettes, though she'll borrow one so that he can get through his morning business.\n\nIt's a lovely opening, sketching Narottam's pally relationship with his daughter, Sushila's testy one, and the casual \"modernity\" of Bitti, at odds with the small town she's in. The film reiterates that last point, which leads to an on-the-nose scene in which a prospective groom asks Bitti if she's a virgin (when she asks him if he's one, he says that doesn't matter), and a later one in which she drinks whiskey straight from the bottle, like all truly liberated people do (when will filmmakers learn that nothing looks as fake as someone swigging alcohol from a bottle like it's an easy thing to do?). Bitti isn't opposed to marriage, but she wants someone who'll respect her for what she is, which is why she's intrigued by a cheap paperback in which the central character -- who smokes, drinks, stays out late and lives in Bareilly -- is, in all likelihood, her.\n\nBitti's efforts to track down the author lead her to local printing press owner Chirag (Khurrana). He falls for her instantly, and doesn't tell her that he -- and not Pritam Vidrohi (Rajkummar Rao), the man he bullied into putting his name and photograph on the jacket -- is the actual writer. They become friends, though Bitti remains intrigued by the thought of Pritam and his apparent approval of her lifestyle. Chirag, sensing a rival, tracks down Pritam in Lucknow, where he's selling saris, and forces him to return to Bareilly, behave brusquely, break Bitti's heart and leave him to clean up.\n\nFew comic scenarios crack me up as consistently as anything involving a timid individual compelled to act a lot tougher than he or she is. In Bringing Up Baby, there's an inspired five minutes of mugging from Katharine Hepburn trying to talk her way out of jail by claiming to be a gangster named Swingin' Door Susie. Or, if you prefer, the simple pleasures of Billy Crystal's psychiatrist in Analyze This, covering for his mobster client at a mafia meeting. Rao's transformation from hesitant sari-draper to confident young jerk is the best passage in the film. The contrast itself is terrific -- his stutter becomes a growl, hesitant behaviour turns decisive -- but what's funnier still is how, after he's out of Bitti's sight, he reverts to being Mild Pritam even though he's still dressed as Crazy Pritam.\n\nThat Chirag's plans go awry shouldn't come as much of a surprise. This allows Khurrana to access the meanness that seems to lurk in several of his characters, but even here the film miscalculates, giving us a scene in which Chirag and his friend briefly torture Pritam, which places him outside the bounds of audience sympathy. Without giving away much more, I'll say that ambitious plot machinations late in the film mean that neither Pritam's nor Bitti's behavior makes much sense -- until it finally does and it's too late. Perhaps some viewers will appreciate this trickery. To me it felt like a sacrificing of character at the altar of cleverness.", "id": "9860043", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Film Review: Bareilly Ki Barfi", "image": "http://www.livemint.com/rf/Image-621x414/LiveMint/Period2/2017/08/19/Photos/Processed/BareillyKiBarfi-kj0F--621x414@LiveMint.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "53310", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jainism"}, "id": "323558", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Katharine Hepburn"}, "id": "346172", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tiwari"}, "id": "390158", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Analyze This"}, "id": "493101", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyze_This"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bhargava"}, "id": "702383", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhargava"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dangal (film)"}, "id": "1273818", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangal_(film)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}], "time": "09:19:00"}

Kriti's onscreen name Bitti is used as a synonym to ?Barfi?.\n\n2) Unabashed female characters: Kriti Sanon and Kangana Ranaut both play the character of a modern free spirited woman. Both are bold, rebel, vibrant, strong headed. Kriti and Kangana both are seen smoking cigarettes and drinking liquor and dance to their hearts\n\n3) Small town: ?Bareilly Ki Barfi? and ?Tanu Weds Manu? are deeply rooted in the interiors of the country. ?Bareilly Ki Barfi? is set in the small town of Bareilly and similarly, ?Tanu Weds Manu? is set in Kanpur, both falling in the state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\n4) Breaking marriage stereotypes: While small towns tend to be more inclined towards arrange marriages, the films ?Tanu weds Manu? and ?Bareilly Ki Barfi? showcase liberal views by giving the lead actresses the freedom to choose their own bridegrooms.\n\n5) Critically acclaimed male leads: ?Tanu Weds Manu? gave us an interesting portrayal of Manu by R Madhavan, ?Bareilly Ki Barfi? gives us two power packed performers in Rajkummar Rao and Ayushmann Khurrana. The films are backed by critically acclaimed male actors.\n\n6) Quirky songs: Both the films have given us chartbuster songs and good music. ?Sadi Gali? and ?Yun Hi? from ?Tanu Weds Manu? are still a favourite of listeners while ?Bareilly Ki Barfi? has given the listeners amazing songs like 'Sweety Tera Drama', 'Twist Kamariya', and 'Nazm Nazm' which have been loved by one and all.\n\n7) Directors: The directors of both the films Anand L Rai and Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari are known to make rooted films, which have been critically acclaimed and loved by the audiences.\n\n8) Budget: ?Bareilly Ki Barfi? and ?Tanu Weds Manu? are both made on modest budget.\n\nWhile ?Tanu Weds Manu? received an exceptional response from the audience for its content, ?BKB? is striking the right chords with the masses for its deep rooted appeal. We just can't wait for the film's release to watch the hit formula recreated with writers Nitesh Tiwari & Shreyas Jain storyline.\n\n?Bareilly Ki Barfi? features Kriti Sanon alongside Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkummar Rao in the lead.\n\nThe film is written by Dangal's writer director Nitesh Tiwari and Shreyas Jain.\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi is Ashiwny Iyer Tiwari's second film as a director and the film has created a lot of right noise, and her direction has been praised by everyone.\n\nJuno Chopra is the creative producer who has been involved with all aspects of the film.\n\nThe collaborative effort between Ashiwny Iyer Tiwari, creative producer Juno Chopra and writer Nitesh Tiwari of Dangal fame and Shreyas Jain has worked very well.\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi is produced by Junglee Pictures and BR Studios.\n\nThe film is slated for release on 18th August 2017.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "id": "9663013", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "'Bareilly Ki Barfi' brings the hit formula of 'Tanu weds Manu'", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3222, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3238}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "51434", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "K\u0101npur"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "53789", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanpur", "label": {"eng": "K\u0101npur"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bollywood"}, "id": "312308", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jainism"}, "id": "323558", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kangna Ranaut"}, "id": "346947", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangna_Ranaut"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "R.

Starring Kriti Sanon, Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkummar Rao in rather interesting roles, the film is a romantic-comedy set in Bareilly. The story revolves around an unapologetic and free-spirited small-town girl Bitti, who is in search of someone who would love her for the way she is.\n\nThe film has a certain raw flavor to it and deals with the lighter side of romance and lots of drama that comes with it. The trailer sees Ayushmann and Rajkummar fighting for Bitti's love resulting in a hilarious love triangle. Just like Ashwini's previous film, Nil Battey Sannat, Bareilly ki Barfi also captures the little things in life in a normal household.\n\nWill the film be able to find enough dose of romance and humor in Bitti's normal life? Will Kriti Sanon be able to overcome her Raabta debacle with this film? Will the film be different from regular run-of-mill rom coms?

While both sides have their arguments, Ayushmann Khurrana believes that real talent is here to stay.\n\nThe actor-singer has crooned a string of popular numbers for his films, including the latest one, 'Nazm Nazm' in 'Bareilly Ki Barfi', produced by Junglee Pictures and BR Studios. Also starring Rajkummar Rao and Kriti Sanon, the film has been directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari and scripted by Nitesh Tiwari (director of the blockbuster 'Dangal').\n\nStating that 'actors can never replace singers', Ayushmann says, \"If you have a great voice, you will be a star eventually. For example, nobody can replace an Arijit Singh, who is so versatile that he can sing anything -- be it a ghazal, a sufi song and a rock number. I understand why singers get upset when they see an actor attempt a song, especially when he is a non-singer. But they should understand that actors do it purely to promote a film and to grab more eyeballs.

it's a second-rate roman-e-clef that he'd conceived after a serious heartbreak, and the Barfi of the book was meant to be a stand-in for his ex-girlfriend.\n\nThe book sells no copies, but when Bitti purchases it at a railway station and reads through it, she is astonished at how well she has been described and decoded.\n\nShe doesn't say it, but the book saves her life and botches her attempt to escape from home -- which also happens to be the home of such incredible actors as Pankaj Tripathi and Seema Bhargava who play Bitti's parents and who threaten to spin this movie off into their personal little world of she snoring in her sleep and he (Tripathi) spelling out all his dreams to a slow-moving ceiling fan.\n\nBhargava and Tripathi are so good here that they stake claim for a movie of their own.\n\nTripathi's face and manner becomes the perfect advertisement for his sweet shop and his puffed mouth, perpetually trying to keep his paan from spilling out, gives his face the quality of a memorable gargoyle that he carries around with him.\n\nSeema Bhargava, as the moral science teacher who settles down into sharbat and tea making when at home, has rapturous scenes with both Tripathi (one look at the couple and you get the colourless history they share) and with Sanon.\n\nThe mother-daughter rat-a-tats with all their manic-depressiveness are genuinely felt and never overdone, and for this dynamic especially, Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari seems to be using up material from her own life (there's something weirdly personal about those bits).\n\nAt any rate, the book that changes Bitti Mishra's life is only ghosted by Dubey, with its authorship being assigned to a sad-sack named Pritam Vidrohi (Rajkummar Rao).\n\nIn the reality of the narrative, Bitti wants to meet Vidrohi, but Dubey can't reveal that he is the true author of the book.\n\nAnd so he whips up a sadistic haiku.\n\nThe nifty premise of Dubey turning the catatonic Vidrohi into a thug -- he coaches him into it -- so that Vidrohi can break Bitti's heart is perhaps the plot point that Bareilly ki Barfi scoops out of Nicolas Barreau's The Ingredients of Love, but this movie is its own beast -- drunk up on an entirely original magic potion.\n\nBoth Khurrana and Rao are terrific physical performers, and they tune into each other's timing like two improv-comedians helping each other polish their act.\n\nAyushmann Khurrana often gets far less credit than what he deserves, and that's maybe because his performances are always carved out as ideal foils for those around him.\n\nOne of our most generous actors, Khurrana, here again, sets up the stage for his co-actors to play off him and flower.\n\nHis understanding of small-town mindsets goes beyond just the intonations -- it's also visible in the way he finishes off his kulfi and blurts out 'Khaathey Main Jod Lo' before the last slurp can go down.\n\nEven as he turns puppy faced for Sanon's Bitti, Khurrana doesn't make his character an innocent puppy.\n\nWith his best friend in tow, he plays cruel little games on Rao's Pritam Vidrohi. While they are constantly putting Vidrohi's life on the line to further their own plans, they also derive pleasure out of using him almost as their personal Gimp.\n\nRajkummar Rao's uninhibited comic performance as Pritam Vidrohi feels like an act of the Method Actor tapping into his favourite playlist.\n\nSliding in and out of his Mama's Boyish-ness, Rao shoots the film sky high every time he appears onscreen.\n\nThis is the Method Actor making you aware of his process while playing a character whose dignity depends on how well he method acts.\n\nThe entire stretch of the movie where the slouch-shouldered Vidrohi transforms himself into an exaggerated rogue and then impresses his new personality upon Bitti Sharma's family must rank among the greatest screwball achievements of Hindi cinema.\n\nThe big magic in those bits is in the way each actor works to keep the other actors vivid for us.\n\nCasting wise, the film is one of the most finely thought-up ensembles of the year.\n\nAs one expects of a thin story such as this one, there's some dawdling toward the end, but even then, there's always a moment of inspiration, or a crazy comedy, or a frayed nerve giving the proceedings enough motor.\n\nThe budget constraints of Bareilly Ki Barfi are visible in the clunky camera set-ups. Also, the wordplays that the actors so wonderfully carry off don't quite sound right when mouthed by Javed Akhtar in his voiceover -- the bounciness tapers off in the VO\n\nBut even through these minor problems what supplies the movie its crazy, maniac energy is its fast-talking.\n\nI don't remember another Indian film -- at least in recent times -- where the actors seemed so much to enjoy saying their lines that they are literally floating by the end of their sentences.\n\nThe utterances in Bareilly Ki Barfi are what give the movie its ballad-like quality.\n\nThis could well have been marketed as a musical created purely out of fast-talking: of the word 'Healthy' being used as a quick substitute for the word 'Fat' of the alliterative effect in the names Bitti and Bubbly; of Khurrana taking leave of Bitti's parents with three random words: Barfi. Moongfali. Dhanyawad.\n\nThere's no way to rationalise the pleasures of Bareilly Ki Barfi -- as a character study it may not quite come together and some of the arcs arent investigated in toto.\n\nWhen Khurrana's Chirag Dubey draws the link between love and sacrifice (Pyar kiya hai, kurbani toh deni padegi), or in a scene between Pritam Vidrohi and his mother, when we get a hint of how the mother may have been strangulating the son with her love and turned him into the bungler that he is, the film warns us that it wants to wend off into darker territories: but it soon regains its comic consciousness.\n\nIf Bareilly Ki Barfi has problems, they would mostly occur to you as afterthoughts.\n\nFor the movie is a lot more than its various scrubby elements: It's primarily an invitation to give yourself over to its flakiness.\n\nWhen I was watching Lipstick Under My Burkha, I felt as though the crowd had come prepared to be somber and ready to value the supposed 'revolutionary ideas' of the movie.\n\nThey had come pre-decided about their feelings about the film -- that if they weren't appreciative enough of Lipstick Under My Burkha, they would, in a way, be exposing their own smallness.\n\nThat was revolution by the numbers.\n\nThe audiences who'd come for Bareilly Ki Barfi didn't seem like they were expecting the movie to be anything more than a silly rom-com.\n\nBut Bareilly Ki Barfi ended up surprising them, and by the end, they were all having such a good time and seemed so happy to be in that theatre together, that you could see why cinema was always meant to be this communal experience to be taken in without pre-judgments.\n\nThere were moments in the movie when a loud laugh escaped my throat. But it didn't seem to matter. Because they were all laughing and my laughter was getting drowned in the laughter of those around me.\n\nRediff Rating:", "id": "9855436", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Bareilly Ki Barfi Review: A screwball comedy you must watch", "image": "https://im.rediff.com/300-300/movies/2017/aug/17bareilly-ki-barfi-lead.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bitti"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "270282", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitti", "label": {"eng": "Bitti"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Train station"}, "id": "306040", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station"}, {"label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}, "id": "306224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bollywood"}, "id": "312308", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ancient Rome"}, "id": "313576", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hindi"}, "id": "314116", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cinema of India"}, "id": "323778", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_India"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tiwari"}, "id": "390158", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Screwball comedy film"}, "id": "432635", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screwball_comedy_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barfi"}, "id": "566242", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barfi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bhargava"}, "id": "702383", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhargava"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pankaj Tripathi"}, "id": "800555", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Tripathi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Preston Sturges"}, "id": "858211", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_Sturges"}, {"label": {"eng": "Seema Bhargava"}, "id": "1440464", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seema_Bhargava"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 9, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 426, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 573, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 575, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}], "time": "08:52:00"}

The apple of her father's eye, she is the quintessential tomboy, who works in the electricity department, smokes, drinks, does break dance, stays out late and watches English films all of which her mother disapproves of.\n\nBeing rejected by boys who come to see her for marriage, becomes her pet peeve as that causes her mother anguish. Dejected, Bitti sets out to leave home.\n\nBy happenstance, she picks up a book, 'Bareilly ki Barfi', from the book stall at the station, which changes her life. She returns home and begins her search for the author, Pritam Vidrohi, as she feels the protagonist in his novel is her carbon copy and he is thus someone who would understand her.\n\nHow she uses Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann Khurrana), the publisher of the book, in her quest, forms the crux of this two-hour film.\n\nThe characters and their lives are introduced to the audience through a narrative by Javed Akhtar in the beginning of the film. The characters are well-etched and developed thoughtfully with consistency.\n\nNitesh Tiwari's sharp writing laced with humour encapsulates the simplicity and warmth of a small town, which is evident in each scene through his characters.\n\nDirector Ashwini Iyer Tiwari keeps the characters and their milieu real. It is the ace writing coupled with the strong performances that elevate the viewing experience further.\n\nRajkumar as Pritam Vidrohi is spectacular as he is every inch the small town, timid, boy who leads a basic life. He slips into the aggressive gunda avatar with equal ease and aplomb, altering his body language and mannerisms perfectly. He steals the thunder from every other actor in the film and is immensely endearing.\n\nAyushmann delivers with sincerity and the metamorphosis of a heartbroken boy to a boy madly in love and finally, a guy who has lost his love is palpable and praiseworthy. Yet, he pales in comparison to Rajkummar.\n\nKriti portrays Bitti with confidence and honesty. She is charming and holds her own although she is pitted against two good male actors.\n\nSeema Pahwa as the gregarious mother, desperate to get Bitti married, if only to comply with societal norms, is a treat to watch. Pankaj Tripathi renders an equally stellar performance as her subservient husband, who supports his daughter, but maintains a silence to keep the peace in the house prevailing, venting out his feelings to the ceiling fan at night.\n\nRohit Chaudhary who plays Munna, Chirag's devoted lackey is a competent actor as well and shines.\n\nThe film is well-mounted and is true to its setting.

Kapil Chopra also known as Juno Chopra is the son of late filmmaker Ravi Chopra. The late filmmaker had given Indian Television the magnum opus epic series, Mahabharat.\n\nTwo years before when Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari was waiting for her directorial debut Nil Battey Sannata to hit the theaters, she came to Juno Chopra with a story that she loved. Juno decided to read the French novel that had a line that inspired the film, he says,\"We'd worked with Nitesh Tiwari (Ashwiny's filmmaker husband) in our earlier production Bhootnath Returns and I'd told her that she was meant to be a director. Once we saw the script Nitesh and Shreyas Jain had penned, there was no going back and I decided to produce Bareilly Ki Barfi\"\n\nHe also added that the films lead actors Ayushmann Khurrana, Rajkummar Rao and Kriti Sanon, were always the first choices for the film. Juno Chopra is all prepared with his slate of three films, after his home production Bareilly Ki Barfi which will hit theaters on 18th August 2017.\n\nThe talented creative producer has admitted that he is still taking \"baby steps\" in reviving his grandfather BR Chopra's legacy and banner. Juno recalled how Superstar Shah Rukh Khan had once advised him how to choose films he wanted to bankroll. Juno says that Shah Rukh Khan told him,'Always make films that you truly believe in and would want to attach your name to.'\n\nHe adds,\"I made that my motto. Today, I'm a hands-on producer. I sit with the writers and work with them.I like to listen to everyone but do what I want to\", Juno also shared that his upcoming three films will cut across genres and will be high on content. He said,\"We'll make announcements shortly. In Hollywood, there are tent-pole superhero films, sci-fi dramas and offbeat fare. India too is steering towards the consensus that content is king. And that's the only thing I'm keeping in mind while green-lighting a script.\"\n\nJuno Chopra laughs at the thought that he and his filmmaker brother who is donning the hat of the director for Ittefaq, which will have Sidharth Malhotra, Sonakshi Sinha, and Akshaye Khanna in prominent roles, are at loggerheads when it comes to the final casting of a film.

The apple of her father's eye, she is the quintessential tomboy, who works in the electricity department, smokes, drinks, does break dance, stays out late and watches English films all of which her mother disapproves of.\n\nBeing rejected by boys who come to see her for marriage, becomes her pet peeve as that causes her mother anguish. Dejected, Bitti sets out to leave home.\n\nBy happenstance, she picks up a book, 'Bareilly ki Barfi', from the book stall at the station, which changes her life. She returns home and begins her search for the author, Pritam Vidrohi, as she feels the protagonist in his novel is her carbon copy and he is thus someone who would understand her.\n\nHow she uses Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann Khurrana), the publisher of the book, in her quest, forms the crux of this two hour film.\n\nThe characters and their lives are introduced to the audience through a narrative by Javed Akhtar in the beginning of the film. The characters are well-etched and developed thoughtfully with consistency.\n\nNitesh Tiwari's sharp writing laced with humour encapsulates the simplicity and warmth of a small town, which is evident in each scene through his characters.\n\nDirector Ashwini Iyer Tiwari keeps the characters and their milieu real. It is the ace writing coupled with the strong performances that elevate the viewing experience further.\n\nRajkumar as Pritam Vidrohi is spectacular as he is every inch the small town, timid, boy who leads a basic life. He slips into the aggressive gunda avatar with equal ease and aplomb, altering his body language and mannerisms perfectly. He steals the thunder from every other actor in the film and is immensely endearing.\n\nAyushmann delivers with sincerity and the metamorphosis of a heart-broken boy to a boy madly in love and finally a guy who has lost his love is palpable and praiseworthy. Yet, he pales in comparison to Rajkummar.\n\nKriti portrays Bitti with confidence and honesty. She is charming and holds her own although she is pitted against two good male actors.\n\nSeema Pahwa as the gregarious mother, desperate to get Bitti married, if only to comply with societal norms, is a treat to watch. Pankaj Tripathi, renders an equally stellar performance as her subservient husband, who supports his daughter, but maintains a silence to keep the peace in the house prevailing, venting out his feelings to the ceiling fan at night.\n\nRohit Chaudhary who plays Munna, Chirag's devoted lackey is a competent actor as well and shines.\n\nThe film is well-mounted and is true to its setting. The music is melodious and \"Sweety tera drama\" is well-picturised and energetic.\n\nThe screenplay and dialogues are what take this film to another level. Else, the basic tale is fairly ordinary and cliched. The actors do justice and deliver, mouthing the well-written lines with conviction and panache, enhancing their characters all the way.\n\nOverall, \"Barielly ki Barfi\" is a tasty sweet treat to rev up your weekend.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "id": "9841675", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": " 'Bareilly ki Barfi': An endearing rom-com worth tasting (IANS Review, Rating: ***1/2) ", "image": "http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/common/no_preview.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Train station"}, "id": "306040", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station"}, {"label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}, "id": "306224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist"}, {"label": {"eng": "Romance film"}, "id": "332398", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tiwari"}, "id": "390158", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pankaj Tripathi"}, "id": "800555", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Tripathi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Seema Bhargava"}, "id": "1440464", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seema_Bhargava"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 426, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting"}], "time": "07:21:00"}

His narrative takes you to the Mishra family - the patriarch (Pankaj Tripathi), matriarch (Seema Pahwa) and their daughter Bitti (Kriti Sanon), whom they have raised 'as a son'.\n\nShe smokes, break dances, asserts her will on her neighbours and spreads out her legs while sitting on a bike.\n\nWhile she has never been treated like a small town girl by he family, she gets disgusted by the misogyny that comes with every prospective groom, while is looking for prospective men to be married to. Dejected, she finds refuge in a book titled Bareilly Ki Barfi that she wantonly picks from a book stall.\n\nThe book that she grabs is ghost written by Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann Khurrana). It seems like he takes off right where he left in his last film Meri Pyaari Bindu. He writes a book in memory of his unrequited love Babli. However, Bitti finds the character of Babli a carbon copy of herself and approaches the publisher of the book to get in touch with the author. The publisher turns out to be Khurrana who gets smitten by Bitti as he sees shades of Babli in her.\n\nThe hurdle however is the picture of the author on the book, which is that of Pritam (Rajkummar Rao), a gullible friend of Chirag who he had convinced to masquerade as the author in order to hide his love for Babli, as she's now happily married.\n\nWhile Chirag serves as the postman of Bitti and delivers her letters to the author, he realises that Bitti has actually fallen for the author, and not the publisher.\n\nChirag convinces Pritam to do him a favour yet again and sets up his meeting with Bitti. But he trains Pritam to project himself as an embodiment of everything that Bitti hates - all her misogynistic prospective grooms rolled into one.\n\nThe trailer of the film has already revealed that we are to expect a love triangle between Chirag, Bitti and Pritam.\n\nDirected by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, Bareilly Ki Barfi is a romantic comedy rooted in the subculture of the north Indian city Bareilly.\n\nKeep tuned for more live updates.\n\nWatch the trailer of the film here:\n\nPublished Date: Aug 17, 2017 08:08 pm | Updated Date: Aug 17, 2017 08:15 pm\n\nTags :#Ashwini iyer tiwari#Ayushmann khurrana#Bareilly ki barfi#Bollywood#Fdfs#Kriti sanon#Nil battey sannata#Rajkummar rao", "id": "9713251", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review LIVE: Ayushmann, Kriti and Rajkummar bring small town charm to life", "image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bkb-social.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2325, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2337}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "51434", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bitti"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "270282", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitti", "label": {"eng": "Bitti"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Author"}, "id": "303833", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"}, {"label": {"eng": "North India"}, "id": "323415", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India"}, {"label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy film"}, "id": "331553", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Love triangle"}, "id": "470855", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_triangle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Javed Akhtar"}, "id": "536726", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javed_Akhtar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barfi"}, "id": "566242", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barfi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pankaj Tripathi"}, "id": "800555", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Tripathi"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 243, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 244, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 251, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Authors", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Authors"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 688, "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Publishing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Publishing"}], "time": "14:47:00"}

In addition to referring to the film's great visuals on Lucknow's food and sweets, as Khurrana points out, the film's title makes Bitti its focal point: \"Bitti is Bareilly ki Barfi,\" says Sanon. What is unique about the film's love triangle is in fact that Bitti is not looking for love, but is instead searching for someone to understand her and accept her for who she is. But both writer and publisher fall in love with Bitti and compete for her affections.\n\nWhile the actors have all worked in the genre of romantic comedies, Rao has essayed more serious, dark, and sometimes outright vile characters on screen. \"For me it was a lot of fun exploring these two different shades of Pritam Vidrohi\", says Rao, who plays the author of the film's eponymous novel. \"He's meek and simple, but in the second half of the same scene he becomes an aggressive guy,\" shares the actor, talking about how he enjoyed portraying the extreme ranges of his character's personality traits. \"It was almost like preparing for two different characters\", he says.\n\nWhile talking about working with second-time director Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, the co-stars gush about the relatability present in her work. \"She's so rooted and so culturally aware,\" says Khurrana. \"She knows the lowest common denominator of the country and easily incorporates that onto celluloid,\" says the actor, referring to the success of her first film, the comedy-drama Nil Battey Sannata (2016). Rao adds, \"You can smell-town India in all these characters.\"\n\nThe exchange soon steers towards how enjoyable the process of shooting was. Khurrana recounts between giggles how amusing the small tiffs between Tiwari and cinematographer Gavemic U. Ary were: explosions of Tamil arguments in the middle of Uttar Pradesh's busy streets. Sanon, on the other hand, enjoyed dancing to Govinda's songs to celebrate the birthday of the elderly man who owns Bitti's house in Lucknow. What is evident is that all three actors were charmed by the city. \"There's the new, modern and developed Gomti Nagar, and also area of Hazratganj with its very old world charm,\" says Rao. \"It's like two different worlds coexisting together,\" he adds, an ironic insight that also describes his role in the film.", "id": "9527053", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "More than a triangle", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/article19503844.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BMBAREILLYKIBARFIFILCASTMUMBAI1", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "51434", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "53310", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bitti"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "270282", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitti", "label": {"eng": "Bitti"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Comedy"}, "id": "302913", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Comedy-drama"}, "id": "311145", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy-drama"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bollywood"}, "id": "312308", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy film"}, "id": "331553", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Romance film"}, "id": "332398", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Love triangle"}, "id": "470855", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_triangle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barfi"}, "id": "566242", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barfi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Homi Adajania"}, "id": "610729", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homi_Adajania"}, {"label": {"eng": "Abrar Alvi"}, "id": "1419217", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrar_Alvi"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 426, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}], "time": "16:56:00"}

The head of the Mishra family, residents of the small town of Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh, is scouting for his pack of cigarettes early morning. Unable to find one, he interrupts his wife (Seema Pahwa) from her daily prayers, who dismisses his interjection until he makes a unique request. 'Ask Bitti for one,' he suggests, alluding to their daughter, whose boisterous behaviour is reason enough for this mother to believe that she is plagued with flaws. This introduction establishes the relationship between the father (Pankaj Tripathi) and his daughter (Kriti Sanon), who was raised 'like a boy' by the former, even occasionally being offered a whiff.\n\nBitti's charm grows on you almost instantly. She is easily agitated, laughs with her heart, and is unperturbed about flinging a book on a sleepy vendor, or shunning an old lady snoozing on her shoulder. Sanon, as the emotional protagonist, will occasionally remind you of Geet (Kareena Kapoor Khan) in 'Jab We Met' (2007), or Kaira (Alia Bhatt) in 'Dear Zindagi', only, she carries a charm that's entirely hers. Bothered by her mother's chiding over her inability to appease the men arriving to ask for her hand, Bitti makes a dash to explore a life away from home, only to stumble upon a book, Bareilly Ki Barfi, whose protagonist, she finds, has traits reminiscent of her. She returns home to scout for the author, almost convinced he's the man of her life. A local vendor - the original author of the book -- Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann Khurrana) offers to help her search for Pritam Vidrohi (Rajkummar Rao), whose name the book is credited to. Dubey finds in Bitti the traits he did in past love interest, also his muse for his book, and hopes to put an end to the 'vanvas' in his love life. But Bitti, smitten by the man who she believes had penned the book, has her hopes pinned on Vidrohi. Dubey trains Vidrohi to put on the front of a quintessential misogynist, the kind of man Bitti would be averse to. But even with his unrefined manners, Vidrohi wins hearts.\n\nAshwini Iyer Tiwari, who made an acclaimed debut with the Swara Bhaskar-starrer 'Nil Battey Sannata' (2016), returns with another film that portrays the lives of the people in a small town. But, unlike the former, which was backed by a strong plot, this one hangs on a threadbare storyline. You're often left wondering why a girl as unabashed as Bitti crumbles under self-doubt when exposed to the misogynistic world that doesn't find in her, a suitable bride. Or how an inhibited Vidrohi, often mistreated by his 'buddy' Dubey, grows brash enough to take him on towards the latter half.\n\nRao, who put on crackling performance is the recently released 'Trapped' and 'Raabta', delivers yet again, both, as the demure friend and the garish man he presents himself to be. His earnest performance may even pull you through the film. However, 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' has several dull moments, which speaks of an editing that wasn't crisp enough.\n\nThe film's dialogues are impeccably written and aptly included. Chuckles seamlessly grow to laughs, applauds even, as the writers (Nitesh Tiwari, Shreyas Jain and Rajat Nonia) successfully capture the flavour of life in this town. A scene sees Bitti's mother appeal to her friend, Dubey, to prevent her from stepping out late, stating, \"Raat raat bhar bahar rehti hai, ladki hai, chudail nahin.\" In another, alluding to Vidrohi, Dubey says, \"Padosi ke bete ko aam ke jhaad pe chadha rahein hain. Neeche aaya to aam milega, gira to tervi pe milega.\" Words like these make you realise the dialogues haven't only been written to inspire giggles, but to aptly depict relationships as well.\n\nUnfortunately, they are all that you remember the film by.\n\nWatch trailer\n\nAlso see: Sanjay Dutt's daughter Trishala looks unrecognisable in these photos\n\nTrending Video\n\nWatch video: Esha Gupta takes her love for fruits to the next level in these hot posts!\n\nDownload the new mid-day android app to get updates on all the latest and trending stories on the go https://goo.gl/8Xlcvr", "id": "9827087", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Bareilly Ki Barfi Movie Review: Too much sugar in this barfi - Entertainment", "image": "http://images.mid-day.com/images/2017/aug/bareilly-ki-barfi-review-l.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "51434", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "55019", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bitti"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "270282", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitti", "label": {"eng": "Bitti"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}, "id": "306224", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jainism"}, "id": "323558", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alia Bhatt"}, "id": "346950", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alia_Bhatt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tiwari"}, "id": "390158", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kareena Kapoor Khan"}, "id": "423906", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareena_Kapoor_Khan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jab We Met"}, "id": "580354", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jab_We_Met"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pankaj Tripathi"}, "id": "800555", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Tripathi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Seema Bhargava"}, "id": "1440464", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seema_Bhargava"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 243, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 244, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 548, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/New Age", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/New_Age"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 905, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's"}], "time": "05:21:00"}

This is a small town love story. Bareilly's Barfi is being talked about in the film, but even in the real life, the stars of this movie have not forgotten the sweetness of the shops in the city where they have spent their childhood.\n\nLike ordinary people, stars also have a favourite sweet shop in their home town.\n\nmid-day.com talks to 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' lead stars Kriti Sanon, Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkummar Rao about their favourite dessert shop in their hometown.\n\nKriti Sanon\n\nKriti Sanon is from Delhi. Talking about a particular sweet shop in her city, she says, \"I have been very fond of sweets since childhood. I used to eat sweets a lot since I am a Punjabi. I am also a fan of Bengali sweets, but my most favorite is the Bhatia Snack Shop, where samosas, tikki and desserts are quite famous.\"\n\nRajkummar Rao\n\nRajkumar Rao has spent a long time in Gurgaon. Rajkummar explains that his city was once known as Gurgaon. Now it is Gurugram. Rajkummar points out that he is quite a foodie. Sweets are his weakness. He says, \"I went to Kolkata to shoot Bose. For Bose's character, I wanted to gain weight, so my breakfast was 14 to 15 rasgullas. I also enjoyed Mishty Doi a lot. If I go to my house in Gurgaon even now, I don't leave without having Manchanda's kulfi. There is also a chaat shop nearby where I always eat. There is a Rupa chaat shop near home. I love the tikkis there. It's my favourite.\n\nAyushmann Khurrana\n\nAyushmann Khurrana is from Chandigarh's Panchkula and is a fan of rasgullas. He says, \"There is Nand shop near my house, from where our evening snacks came. Even today when I go there, I buy lots of sweets and enjoy it. I love rasgullas too. During the shooting of Meri Pyaari Bindu, I enjoyed Mishti Doi and rasgullas in Kolkata.\n\nAlso see: Sanjay Dutt's daughter Trishala looks unrecognisable in these photos\n\nTrending Video\n\nWatch video: Esha Gupta takes her love for fruits to the next level in these hot posts!\n\nDownload the new mid-day android app to get updates on all the latest and trending stories on the go https://goo.gl/8Xlcvr", "id": "9701526", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Not 'Bareilly Ki Barfi', but film stars are crazy about these sweets! - Entertainment", "image": "http://images.mid-day.com/images/2017/aug/Kriti-Sanon-dance-l.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 256, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 265}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Gurgaon"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "54287", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurgaon", "label": {"eng": "Gurgaon"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "54715", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Chand\u012bgarh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "54943", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh", "label": {"eng": "Chand\u012bgarh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "54980", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "55019", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Snack"}, "id": "303384", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snack"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dessert"}, "id": "305368", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessert"}, {"label": {"eng": "Romance film"}, "id": "332398", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punjabi language"}, "id": "335380", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Samosa"}, "id": "356186", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samosa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chaat"}, "id": "374795", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sanjay Dutt"}, "id": "423925", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Dutt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bengali cuisine"}, "id": "687971", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_cuisine"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 231, "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 350, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Television and Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Television_and_Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1502, "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Mystery Shopping", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Mystery_Shopping"}], "time": "13:48:00"}

She went to Rae Bareli, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Kolkata...to understand consumer behaviour and buying patterns. And there, she people watched. \"These trips are a great way to understand people, to know how they live, how they speak, how they think, how they dress...,\" says Tiwari, whose Bareilly Ki Barfi releases today.\n\nAll that learning goes into peopling her film with characters that speak the language of the area. Be it the delightful Nil Battey Sannata, or this film, where the trailer throws the spotlight on an India that pulsates with emotion and fun, and a healthy dose of reality.\n\nSo, what about Uttar Pradesh tempts Tiwari into setting her films there? \"Well, it is now familiar terrain, after Nil...and Bareilly...,\" she says. \"I wanted to shoot NBS there, because the Taj Mahal is a symbol of love, and I wanted the relationship between the mother and daughter to play out against that background. As for BKB, we were pondering about titles that complement Bittu, my heroine, and mithai, because her father runs a sweetmeat stall. That's when Bareilly Ki Barfi cropped up.\"\n\nTiwari feels this generation is far removed from hers. \"The changing economics of our country and its overall mood reflects in the movies we make. This generation seems to prefer stories of us rather than them. If our generation was about earning more money, going abroad, and foreign brands, this generation has been there and done that. They party but also come back home for the family puja. In a sense, they are getting back to their roots.\"\n\nHer leads, Rajkummar Rao, Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon reflect this new reality. So do character artistes such as Seema Bhargava and Pankaj Tripathi. \"The beauty lies in breaking stereotypes. I did that with Pankajji, usually cast as villain, by getting him to play the teacher in NBS. I believe the job of a director is to mould actors into characters. Kriti is beautiful and glamorous, but she's also intelligent. She's an engineer, her father's a chartered accountant and her mother is a professor in physics. She's a regular middle-class girl in real life.\"\n\nIs casting against the grain one of Tiwari's biggest successes? \"If an actor starts overpowering a character, I've not done my job well. Every other role can be delegated, but it is the director's job to extract a good performance. I do my homework before casting, and believe actors, the script and the director come together because of destiny. That said, I speak a lot to my actors, understand who they are, what they think...it reflects in their performance. By the time we begin filming, we are close friends.\"\n\nTiwari teams up with her husband Nitesh Tiwari (of Chilar Party, Bhoothnath Returns and Dangal fame) for this film too -- he's co-written the story with Shreyas Jain. \"We work well as a team, him writing and I directing. We are clear about our demarcations, and trust each other. Writers write with a certain vision; directors must be true to that world. But, we are very different directors. He's meticulous, and while I am as prepared, I go with the flow.\"\n\nDoes Tiwari ever see herself directing a commercial subject? \"I don't think I could do something escapist. I can create a surreal world, but even that will be rooted in what I believe in. A masala film is not something engraved in me. I will be able to do justice, but my heart won't fully be in it,\" she says.\n\nLast year, Tiwari directed the Tamil remake of NBS -- Amma Kanakku.

Hindi films have come a long way from days of the elegant Romance between the 'strait jacketed' hero and coy and well mannered heroine in a metropolis or in the Swiss Alps as reflected in films like 'Chandni', 'Kabhi Kabhie' and 'Dilwale Dulhanian Le Jayenge'.\n\nIn sharp contrast are characters of films released in recent years like 'Tanu weds Manu', 'Shuddh Desi Romance', 'Fukrey', 'Behen Hogi Teri' and 'Badrinath Ki Dulhanian' which are seen to display an increasing realism in their behaviour and candour in their expressions of love.\n\nAshwini Iyer Tewari's 'Bareilly Ki Barfi ' in another triangular love story between Bitti, Chirag and Pritam, residing in the small town of Bareilly.\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi 'is the story of Bitti Mishra (Kriti Sanon), the daughter of Mishra family residing in Bareilly. A bohemian girl, Bitti Mishra works at the electricity board, is a casual smoker, watches English movies and loves break dance. Her parents have brought her up like a boy, which explains her free spiritedness. However, for all her bohemian nature, she is unable to find a suitable groom. Having resigned herself to being a misfit in this small-town, Bitty decides to run away from home. At the railway book stall, she stumbles upon a novel called 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' , the female protagonist of which reads exactly like her.\n\nThe book that she grabs is ghost written by Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann Khurrana) who had written a book in memory of his unrequited love Babli. However, Bitti finds the character of Babli a carbon copy of herself and approaches the publisher of the book to get in touch with the author. The publisher turns out to be Khurrana who gets smitten by Bitti as he sees shades of Babli in her.\n\nThe hurdle however is the picture of the author on the book, which is that of Pritam (Rajkummar Rao), a friend of Chirag who he had convinced to masquerade as the author in order to hide his love for Babli, as she's now happily married.\n\nWhile Chirag serves as the postman of Bitti and delivers her letters to the author, he realises that Bitti has actually fallen for the author, and not the publisher.\n\nChirag convinces Pritam to do him a favour yet again and sets up his meeting with Bitti. But he trains Pritam to project himself as an embodiment of everything that Bitti hates -- all her misogynistic prospective grooms rolled into one. The film is about the love triangle between Bitti, Chirag and Pritam.\n\nA slice-of-life romance in the backdrop of a small town, 'Bareilly Ki Barfi ' bowls you over with its refreshing candour and its 'matter of fact' feel that comes across from the interactions between its characters.\n\nBitti, who indulges in smoking and breaks into a 'break dance' at the drop of a hat, is unlike any of the women characters one has come across in mainstream Bollywood. In this context, it seems an extension of the female protagonists in films like 'Tanu weds Manu' and Shuddh Desi Romance'.\n\nThe screenplay and dialogues by Nitesh Tewari (of Dangal' fame) bring across the flavour of the small town Bareilly. He has also etched out the characters of Bitti, Chirag and Pritam brilliantly, lending a life like feel to them, which adds to the vibrancy of the film.\n\nLike his earlier film 'Dangal', he manages to impart an 'earthy' feel to 'Bareilly Ki Barfi ', which will make the audience identify with lives of the three protagonists.\n\nAfter 'Nil Battey Sannata', Ashwini Iyer Tewari again manages to draw us into the charm and the vibrancy of small town life. There is a refreshing honesty about the characters of the film, which makes one identify with their lives. She also manages to extract brilliant performances from the cast.\n\nAs the bohemian girl next door Bitti, Kriti Sanon is effortlessly entertaining. Her transformation from the stylish diva of films 'Dilwale' to the bohemian Bitti is amazing. She brings to life the character of Bitti, which is thanks also to the excellent script. It is easily one of the best performances of her career so far.\n\nAs Chirag, who writes the book 'Bareilly Ki Barfi ' out of his unrequited love for Babli and who tries hard to ensure that Bitti does not fall for his friend Pritam, Ayushmann Khurrana comes across as cute and endearing. The surprise of the film is, however, Rajkummar Rao as Pritam. He comes up with another ace performance both as the reserved Pritam as well as his 'loud mouthed' avatar in which Chirag asks him to meet Bitti. Another award worthy act from the actor after 'Aligarh', 'citylights ' and 'Trapped'.\n\nAmong other actors, Pankaj Tripathi and Seema Pahwa impress as parents of Bitti. They add humour to the proceedings. Another highlight of the film is its music.\n\n'Bareilly Ki Barfi ' is an excellent Romcom, which wows you with its refreshing screenplay that brings across the vibrant hues of small town life, and its outstanding performances. Rating: 3.5/5: one for screenplay and dialogues, one for direction, one for the performances by the cast and 0.5 for music.

The apple of her father's eye, she is the quintessential tomboy, who works in the electricity department, smokes, drinks, does break dance, stays out late and watches English films all of which her mother disapproves of.\n\nBeing rejected by boys who come to see her for marriage, becomes her pet peeve as that causes her mother anguish. Dejected, Bitti sets out to leave home.\n\nBy happenstance, she picks up a book, 'Bareilly ki Barfi', from the book stall at the station, which changes her life. She returns home and begins her search for the author, Pritam Vidrohi, as she feels the protagonist in his novel is her carbon copy and he is thus someone who would understand her.\n\nHow she uses Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann Khurrana), the publisher of the book, in her quest, forms the crux of this two hour film.\n\nThe characters and their lives are introduced to the audience through a narrative by Javed Akhtar in the beginning of the film. The characters are well-etched and developed thoughtfully with consistency.\n\nNitesh Tiwari's sharp writing laced with humour encapsulates the simplicity and warmth of a small town, which is evident in each scene through his characters.\n\nDirector Ashwini Iyer Tiwari keeps the characters and their milieu real. It is the ace writing coupled with the strong performances that elevate the viewing experience further.\n\nRajkumar as Pritam Vidrohi is spectacular as he is every inch the small town, timid, boy who leads a basic life. He slips into the aggressive gunda avatar with equal ease and aplomb, altering his body language and mannerisms perfectly. He steals the thunder from every other actor in the film and is immensely endearing.\n\nAyushmann delivers with sincerity and the metamorphosis of a heart-broken boy to a boy madly in love and finally a guy who has lost his love is palpable and praiseworthy. Yet, he pales in comparison to Rajkummar.\n\nKriti portrays Bitti with confidence and honesty. She is charming and holds her own although she is pitted against two good male actors.\n\nSeema Pahwa as the gregarious mother, desperate to get Bitti married, if only to comply with societal norms, is a treat to watch. Pankaj Tripathi, renders an equally stellar performance as her subservient husband, who supports his daughter, but maintains a silence to keep the peace in the house prevailing, venting out his feelings to the ceiling fan at night.\n\nRohit Chaudhary who plays Munna, Chirag's devoted lackey is a competent actor as well and shines.\n\nThe film is well-mounted and is true to its setting. The music is melodious and \"Sweety tera drama\" is well-picturised and energetic.\n\nThe screenplay and dialogues are what take this film to another level. Else, the basic tale is fairly ordinary and cliched. The actors do justice and deliver, mouthing the well-written lines with conviction and panache, enhancing their characters all the way.\n\nOverall, \"Barielly ki Barfi\" is a tasty sweet treat to rev up your weekend.\n\n--IANS\n\ntroy/sas/vm\n\nSEARCH", "id": "9841463", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "'Bareilly ki Barfi': An endearing rom-com worth tasting (IANS Review, Rating: ***1/2)", "image": "http://static.sify.com/cms/commons/widget/images/featured-thumbs-default-img.gif", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Train station"}, "id": "306040", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station"}, {"label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}, "id": "306224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist"}, {"label": {"eng": "Romance film"}, "id": "332398", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tiwari"}, "id": "390158", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pankaj Tripathi"}, "id": "800555", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Tripathi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barfi!"}, "id": "1298976", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barfi!"}, {"label": {"eng": "Seema Bhargava"}, "id": "1440464", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seema_Bhargava"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 426, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting"}], "time": "07:20:00"}

Her knack for showing small town people and their issues is commendable, but again banking unconditionally on her with just one film isn't justified either. Ashwini brings yet another small town flavoured film Bareilly Ki Barfi, but this time with a clich\u00e9d formula of a love triangle.\n\nBitti Mishra (Kriti Sanon) stays in Bareily and is the only daughter of her parents Pankaj Tripathi and Seema Pahwa. She is a modern, fearless and flamboyant girl, who believes in breaking societal norms. Chirag (Ayushmann Khurrana), a small time local writer, secretly admires Bitti and keeps writing his feelings in a book which Bitti coincidentally reads and soon after, she falls for him but things turn upside down when Chirag plants his best friend Pritam (Rajkummar Rao) as the original writer. Who gets Bitti in the end is what the film all about.\n\nAshwini clearly wanted to make a love triangle set in the small town with comic punches. The film is highly inspired by the romantic cult of our times, like Saajan, that featured Madhuri Dixit, Sanjay Dutt and Salman Khan. The plot of the film is not even an inch different from it but this film stands out with its comical elements.\n\nThe film also reminds of Kunal Kohli's directorial debut Mujhse Dosti Karoge where Hrithik Roshan mistakes his true love Rani Mukerji with the vivacious Kareena Kapoor Khan. The subject has been done to death but Ashwini and her team try hard to play around with the treatment, but to no avail. Written by her director-husband Nitesh Tiwari, the film is enjoyable, but in parts, especially in the first half, where Ashwini has taken much time to build her characters. However, the film picks up its pace in the second half but it's too late by then. The climax of the film is so predictable that one could easily guess who will get the girl in the end. Although, the trailer of the film looked quite appealing, the film fails to build on it. It is watchable, though one must not expect a Tanu Weds Manu or Dum Laga Ke Haisha, which belonged to similar settings.\n\nThe music of the film is passable, except for the song Aabra Ka Dabra which is peppy enough to groove to.\n\nKriti Sanon is seen in such a deglammed role for the first time in her career. Three films old, Kriti is good with her act and the UP dialect, but somehow is a misfit for the film. She is too urban and fashionable for a film set in Bareily. Unfortunately, she also doesn't pass off as Pankaj and Seema's daughter. Ayushmann is pretty much a veteran when it comes to playing a desirable boy from a small city. He is apt but the one who steals the show is definitely Rajkummar Rao. He proves with every film that he is a brilliant actor and can overshadow any actor in the frame. His transition from a shy introvert to a rowdy guy is the selling point of the film. Pankaj Tripathi and Seema Pahwa are the saving grace of this sinking ship.

The Mishra family - father (Pankaj Tripathi), mother (Seema Pahwa) and daughter Bitti (Kriti Sanon) live in Bareilly. Bitti had been brought up in a liberal environment. She is bold and brash, and this results in a couple of broken engagements. After another marriage proposal goes awry, Bitti chances upon a novel titled Bareilly KI Barfi, the protagonist of which is very similar to her. She begins a search for the author, which leads her to Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann Khurrana), a printing press owner, who had authored and printed the book five years ago after a heartbreak. Not wanting to put his name on the book, he had used his friend Pritam Vidrohi's (Rajkummar Rao) name. Which leads Pritam to leave his city and take up a job in Lucknow. Now Chirag begins up the charade of being the messenger between her and the author. However, things take a crazy turn when Chirag decides to track his friend and prove how unsuitable he is for Bitti. What happens next, forms the crux of the movie.\n\nThe writing is clever and the humour, clean. Writers Nitesh Tiwari and Shreyas Jain keep the characters real and rooted. The protagonists we see here, thankfully, aren't painted in just one shade. Ayushmann may be a guy smitten with the girl, but he isn't another Mr Goody-Two-Shoes ready to sacrifice his love. He is selfish and a borderline bully. Rajkummar is a pushover, but he can stand-up for himself, Kriti while being a confident girl, has her share of insecurities. Director Ashwiny keeps the narrative simple. The music is in-sync with the tone of the film. Ayushmann is on point with his character. Despite the flaws in his character, you root for him. Rajkummar is a delight as he switches from a meek guy to a rowdy dude back-and-forth easily. While Kriti shares great chemistry with both the actors, it's the scenes between Ayushmann and Rajkummar that draw maximum laughs. This is Kriti's fourth film and definitely her best performance so far. Pankaj and Seema are great performers and add so much depth to the film.\n\nThe editing could have been sharper. The film does drag at times and shortening the narrative would have helped. The reason behind Ayushmann wanting to portray Rajkummar as an unsuitable candidate seems a bit flimsy, especially considering the fact that this is what a large part of the movie is based on.\n\nThis is an entertaining, romantic film laced with humour and feel-good moments.

Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, who broke into Bollywood last year with that sleeper hit starring Swara Bhaskar, is back this week with her second film, Bareilly Ki Barfi.\n\nNil Battey Sannata was set in the Indian city that houses Shah Jahan's monument to his love for Mumtaz Mahal. Bareilly so far has been best known to Bollywood gazers for the many musical references it has inspired, and most famously of course for that jhumka that Sadhna lost in the local bazaar in Mera Saaya 51 years back. I wish I could tell you it will henceforth be known for Bitti Mishra.\n\nThe poster of Bareilly Ki Barfi.\n\nBitti who?\n\nThat would be our heroine (played by Kriti Sanon), a spirited young resident of the place whose father runs a sweet shop, mother is a school teacher and who is herself working in the public grievances section of the city's electricity department. Bitti's parents are worried sick because though they have paraded their beti before dozens of prospective grooms, she is still kunwaari.\n\nWhether or not she is a kanya in the complete sense of the word is a separate question that they have not dwelt on, but one potential husband does. \"Are you a vurjjinn?\" he asks her on the terrace of her home, where she and he have been sent to bond while both sets of parents wait expectantly downstairs. Bitti snubs him, as any self-respecting woman should, and so her matashri's lamentations for her daughter continue.\n\nThis is our introduction to both Bitti and Bareilly Ki Barfi (BKB). Bitty is a non-conformist with a mind of her own, we are told: she ignores curfews imposed on daughters alone, does the break dance and rides a mobike in this conservative milieu. Add to that her professional and financial independence, a point underlined by her supportive Dad, and you might assume writers Nitesh Tiwari and Shreyas Jain would be satisfied with their rather neat profile of a small-town woman who refuses to be constrained by social straitjackets. But no sir, they are not.\n\nDespite all these markers of Bitti's free spirit, Tiwari and Jain (who earlier collaborated on Dangal, which the former directed) feel the need to make smoking the overriding signifier of her sense of independence by stressing and re-stressing it, then colouring it with a bold red marker in case we have not noticed - because Bollywood has for some reason in the past decade or so decided to make the cigarette the ultimate metaphor for feminism. Apparently, courage and a sense of independence are not good enough.\n\nNitpicking, did you say? Actually not. This confused feminism signifies the writers' lack of conviction and clarity that turns out to be BKB's undoing.\n\nFirst, while the film's first 20 minutes are devoted solely to Bitti, once the hero enters the frame she is completely sidelined. This delightful creature, brimful of potential though she is, is relegated to the margins as soon as we meet Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann Khurrana) and Pritam Vidrohi (Rajkummar Rao). From then on, Bitti is reduced to being nothing more than the object of their interest and duelling.\n\nSecond, both BKB's male leads are victims of half-hearted writing, lost to the most inconsistent characterisation I have seen in a Hindi film in a while. The motivations for their actions are unconvincing because each man's nature and character swings from left to right like a pendulum throughout the narrative. No, this not what you might describe as shades of gray, this is a different colour of the rainbow in successive scenes.\n\nWith a screenplay this weak, nothing can save BKB. Not Sanon's natural charisma (this woman is truly special, give her better projects please!) nor Khurrana's innate charm. Not the flashes of genius we get to see from Seema Pahwa and Pankaj Tripathi playing Bitti's parents Susheela and Narottam; and from Rao when his character Pritam is being bullied by his friend Chirag.\n\nPahwa, Tripathi and Rao in particular pounce on every morsel of inspiration available in this largely uninspired script. All five artistes far outshine their film.\n\nBKB even fails to explore Bareilly with any degree of detailing. Add to this one of the plainest soundtracks delivered by Bollywood this year (featuring songs by five composers) and it almost feels like Ms Tiwary and her writing team lost interest in this venture halfway through it.\n\nIt did not start off this way. In the opening 20 minutes of BKB, there are little touches that hold out a promise of better things to come. Like a dejected middle-class Mum stuffing namkeen back into its plastic container after the departure a possible dulha's family from a ladki dekhna session, while her forlorn spouse packs laddoos back into their dabba. Like that scene in which Bitti lies to a cop that she is Christian and he breaks into broken English without batting an eyelid, as any north Indian fed on Bollywood stereotypes would. These well-observed moments are a reminder of the detailing in Nil Battey Sannata, a film that was both intensely local and universal. The rest of BKB does not live up to them.\n\nThe only positive that remains consistent throughout BKB is the humour in its dialogues (barring the decidedly silly, schmaltzy climax). Funny conversations, however, are not enough to redeem the insubstantial story into which they are written.\n\nMy heart kind of broke as I watched BKB. 2017 has been a lousy year for quality Hindi cinema so far. Apart from a handful of indies that have shone in the dark, the rest of Bollywood's offerings in the past eight months has been bad enough to tempt a cinemaniac to hang up her boots. Even in my saddest moments in the months gone by though, I did not dream that the woman who brought us the life-affirming tale of Chanda and Apu from Nil Battey Sannata would follow that up with the blandness that is Bareilly ki Barfi.\n\nWhat happened, Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari?\n\nPublished Date: Aug 18, 2017 02:42 pm | Updated Date: Aug 18, 2017 03:01 pm\n\nTags :#Ashwini iyer tiwai#Ayushmann khurrana#Bareilly ki barfi#Bollywood#Dangal#Kriti sanon#Movie review#Nil battey sannata#Rajkummar rao", "id": "9864203", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review: This Ayushmann, Kriti, Rajkummar starrer ain't no Nil Battey Sannata", "image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bareilly-ki-barfi-review-2.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 5956, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 5968}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bitti"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "270282", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitti", "label": {"eng": "Bitti"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bollywood"}, "id": "312308", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hindi"}, "id": "314116", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi"}, {"label": {"eng": "North India"}, "id": "323415", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jainism"}, "id": "323558", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cinema of India"}, "id": "323778", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_India"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shah Jahan"}, "id": "336602", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Jahan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tiwari"}, "id": "390158", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Swara Bhaskar"}, "id": "434935", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swara_Bhaskar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sannata"}, "id": "566844", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sannata"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pankaj Tripathi"}, "id": "800555", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Tripathi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Arjumand Banu"}, "id": "860011", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjumand_Banu"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dangal (film)"}, "id": "1273818", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangal_(film)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Seema Bhargava"}, "id": "1440464", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seema_Bhargava"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 573, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}], "time": "09:42:00"}

Such rooted stories work big time, especially if they provide ample entertainment. The success of TANU WEDS MANU RETURNS, SULTAN and DANGAL in recent times have made it evident how such 'desi' flicks have a large acceptance. BAREILLY KI BARFI, this week's release, too is based in Bareilly, as the title suggests, and looks entertaining from the promos. So does it manage to tickle viewers' funny bone or turns to be yet another flop in the season of debacles, let's analyze.\n\nAlso Read: Bareilly Ki Barfi Trailer: Watch Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkummar Rao wooing Kriti Sanon\n\nBAREILLY KI BARFI is about a printing press owner who devises a unique plan to woo the girl he loves but the idea backfires. Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann Khurrana) runs a printing press in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh. After being heartbroken, he writes a book called 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' on the girl he was in love with. Fearing that she'll be slammed if he writes the book in his own name, he puts the name of Pritam Vidrohi (Rajkummar Rao), his shy, soft-spoken friend, as the book's author. The book fails big time but five years later, Bitti (Kriti Sanon), the coolest girl in town, buys it one day from the railway station, when she was about to run away after her mother Sheela's (Seema Pahwa) constant rants over her marriage. In the train, Bitti reads 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' and is stunned to see that the girl described in the novel is very much like her - free spirited, break dance lover, smoker, film buff and progressive. She immediately returns back to Bareilly and meets Chirag, since he had printed the book, and asks him for Pritam's contact details, since she is impressed by the book. Chirag slowly falls for Bitti but is not able to tell her that it's him and not Pritam who wrote 'Bareilly Ki Barfi'. Chirag then devises a plan - he tells Pritam to have a makeover, meet Bitti, break her heart and run off. At this point, Chirag would take over and hopefully woo Bitti successfully. Sadly for Chirag, Bitti slowly starts falling for Pritam. How Chirag then attempts to ensure that doesn't happen forms the rest of the story.\n\nBAREILLY KI BARFI begins well and the introduction of characters is done in a neat manner. But the film really picks up steam when Pritam enters the narrative. His transformation and the whole process is hilarious and in several ways, is the best portion of the film. Chirag-Bitti's sequences in the first half aren't great but make for a nice watch. One sequence which particularly stands out is Bitti celebrating Chirag's birthday. Post-interval, things look fine initially. The comic and dramatic moments continue and entertain but after a point, the film drags. BAREILLY KI BARFI never was illogical but yet, few aspects seem too difficult to digest. Firstly, why did Chirag not use a pseudonym to write his novel? His character is also shown to be quite a 'dabangg' who has no qualms in ragging and terrorizing Pritam. Yet, he never gathers the courage to tell Bitti how much he loves her. There's a twist in the tale in the finale which does catch viewers unawares and it brings a relief since the climax was getting clich\u00e9d. But the explanation given behind the twist again turns out to be too unconvincing.\n\nBAREILLY KI BARFI is adapted from the book 'The Ingredients Of Love' by Nicolas Barreau. Nitesh Tiwari and Shreyas Jain's story is weak and needed quite a bit of polishing. Nitesh Tiwari and Shreyas Jain's screenplay is effective at places but otherwise, it drags. Nitesh Tiwari and Shreyas Jain's dialogues however are terrific and probably the best thing of the film. Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari's direction is uncomplicated and simple and that's her biggest victory. But the director, who helmed the well-made NIL BATTEY SANNATA last year, could have done a better job and kept the film tighter.\n\nAyushmann Khurrana as always appears confident and dominates some of the sequences quite well. He looks convincing as the lover boy as well as the bully (in scenes with Rajkummar) and this is quite praiseworthy. However, his friendzoned avatar does remind one of his act in his previous film MERI PYAARI BINDU. It's amusing that he played a role in a similar zone in two back-to-back films. Kriti Sanon delivers a decent performance and works on her accent, mannerisms etc to appear a small-town girl. She doesn't succeed completely but nevertheless, it works for her progressive character. Rajkummar Rao is a scene-stealer. He's seen as the shy, demure person and post the transformation, he turns into an outgoing, brash guy and he essays both the avatars brilliantly. If BAREILLY KI BARFI will be remembered in the years to come, it will be primarily for this National Award winning actor's performance! Pankaj Tripathi (Narrotam Mishra) is funny and also excels nicely in emotional scenes. Even he has played roles in the similar setting but he manages to ensure each of his performance stands out. Seema Bhargava leaves a very huge mark. Her constant rants over Bitti's marriage and the way she sparkles everytime she comes across a prospective groom is nicely done. Rohit Chaudhary (Munna) is fine as Chirag's sidekick. Same goes for Swati Semwal (Maya).\n\nThe music of the film is not memorable. 'Sweety Tera Drama' is the only track that registers. 'Badass Babuaa' is relegated to the background during the entertaining montage of Pritam's transformation. 'Nazm Nazm' fails to make a mark while 'Bairaagi' is wasted. 'Twist Kamariya' is forced but since it's added during opening credits, one won't mind. Sameer Uddin's background score is highly entertaining and uplifting.\n\nGavemic U Ary's cinematography is nothing special but the very first scene is very well captured. Chandrashekhar Prajapati's editing is pacy but goes off track in the second half.\n\nOn the whole, BAREILLY KI BARFI has its moments and boasts of great performances but it's too unconvincing. Also, lack of face value and low-key promotions coupled with insipid music as well as domination by TOILET - EK PREM KATHA will spell doom for the film at the box office.", "id": "9847104", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Movie Review: Bareilly Ki Barfi", "image": "http://www.freepressjournal.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Bareilly-Ki-Barfi.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "51434", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Train station"}, "id": "306040", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_station"}, {"label": {"eng": "North India"}, "id": "323415", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jainism"}, "id": "323558", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tiwari"}, "id": "390158", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bhargava"}, "id": "702383", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhargava"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}], "time": "07:59:00"}

In fact, I was also told in my initial days that there are no flaws in my appearance to look real. You still have to play a de-glam role to prove your acting skill.\"\n\nKriti says it's unfair.\n\nShe added: \"I think as an audience, for me, what interests me is how layered the character is, if there is some complexity in her character that could engage me to watch. Perfection of her appearance has got nothing to do with her personality, right?\"\n\nHowever, she believes that such things happened also depending on the fate of the film.\n\n\"Overall, if the film and your character connect with the audience, then people also notice your performance.

She questions every regular thing like why can't girls do this or that; she is a very rational minded person. I am also like her and that is why I could connect with her so much,\" she said.\n\nHowever, there is dissimilarity, Kriti added.\n\n\"She wants a man to get married to, who can accept her the way she is, more than anything else. When it comes to me, love has to happen to get married\" she said.\n\nThis is the first time Kriti has worked with actors Ayushmann Khuranaa and Rajkummar Rao in the Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari directorial.\n\nShe said: \"Since they come from a theatre background, their approach towards a character is quite similar and that helped me to enhance my performance; because acting is also about reacting to your co-actors.\"\n\n--IANS\n\naru/dc/dg\n\nSEARCH", "id": "9890563", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Have to play de-glam role to prove acting talent, says Kriti Sanon", "image": "http://static.sify.com/cms/commons/widget/images/featured-thumbs-default-img.gif", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 8, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false, "textEnd": 14}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "51434", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "55019", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Indo-Asian News Service"}, "id": "305741", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Asian_News_Service"}, {"label": {"eng": "Iyer"}, "id": "349313", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tiwari"}, "id": "390158", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dilwale (2015 film)"}, "id": "1279958", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilwale_(2015_film)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barfi!"}, "id": "1298976", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barfi!"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 426, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 713, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 936, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Agents and Agencies", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Agents_and_Agencies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1023, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Circus", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Circus"}], "time": "12:19:00"}

Having started out as a model, she made her way into films down south, acting opposite Mahesh Babu in the psychological thriller Nenokkadine. Her Bollywood debut with Heropanti was a rather quiet affair, since the film didn't really do well at the BO. However, she came into the spotlight with the Shah Rukh Khan starrer Dilwale. Now awaiting the release of her upcoming film Bareilly Ki Barfi, the actress chats about the ups and downs of Bollywood and how she's a simple girl under the polish.\n\nWhy the title Bareilly Ki Barfi?\n\nMy father has a sweet meat shop in the small town of Bareilly in the film, and the character that I play has quite a sweet tooth. Though the director Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari got the idea for the film from the French book Ingredients of Love, the story is actually quite different from the original.\n\nHave you read the book yourself?\n\nI'm not very fond of reading books, so no. I do love to watch films, and I think this will be a good one.\n\nPeople in Uttar Pradesh who hail from the small town of Bareilly have a particular dialect. Did you have to work on that for the film?\n\nYes, I did have to work on my dialect and pronunciation a little, just to give the authentic flavour and feel of a girl belonging to UP.\n\nPeople close to you have often said that you're very down-to-earth for someone who's in the glam world. Would you agree?\n\nYes. I think that I am very simple at heart. I come from a middle class family and I think that that makes me pretty grounded. It surprises a lot of people though. I remember the first time that I met Ashwiny. When she came out of her office to meet me, I was sitting on the ground reading the script with my hair up in a messy bun. She asked me, \"Are you always like this?\" She'd seen my modelling photos, so she thought I'd be more of a fashionable sort. But I told her that I'd just be exhausted if I had to dress up all the time (laughs).\n\nWhat was your parents reaction to your becoming a Bollywood actor?\n\nMy mom still asks me, \"Tu actor kaise ban gayi?\" (How did you become an actor?).\n\nThey're flummoxed since I don't like getting dressed up or wearing make-up like most other actresses do. My mother calls me jhalli.\n\nDo you think that the way the industry treats you changes with every hit and flop film?\n\nThere is a positive attitude overall from your filmy peers whenever your film does well or an actor or actress proves her acumen in a film. But it's exactly the opposite with flops. Instead of offering support, there's just a negative reaction from filmmakers. Directors need to judge an artiste by his or her talent and not the how their last film did.

This love story from a small town in Uttar Pradesh is called Barefilly Ki Barfi. But the film has so many different flavours that we feel it should be called Bareilly Ki Chaat! It has a spicy flavour in the love hate relationship of Ayushmann Khuranna-Rajkumar Rao and there's sweetness in the old school romance too.\n\nSweetness may be oozing out of the title, but trust us the film won't give you a sugar rush. There is no special dhamakedar entry for the lead stars as they are close to reality, fighting their insecurities and yet so lovable. Based on a French book, 'Ingredients of Love', this film also has stark similarities with Salman Khan, Sanjay Dutt and Madhuri Dixit's hit 1991 hit, Saajan. Bitti played be Kriti Sanon finds a book called Bareilly Ki Barfi', she feels she is the lead character in his book. Ayushmann has written the book, but puts his 'mooh bola dost' Rajkumar Rao's name on it. Madly in love with her, Ayushmann creates a cringe worthy character out of Rao to make Bitti choose him over Rao.\n\nSo let's give you the ingredients of Bareilly Ki Chaat:\n\nMeethi Dahi: Pankaj Tripathi in the role of Mishraji and his daughter Bitti aka Kriti Sanon are the sweetest characters in the film. He wanted a son, but when he is blessed by a daughter, he raises her like a boy. Gives her freedom to be herself and even when he wishes to see her get married doesn't makes her life miserable. There is a scene where the father is seen borrowing cigarette from his daughter's pack. How often do we see that kind of equation between a father and daughter on the big screen?\n\nBitti is regular small town girl, who wants to break away from the gender bias. She is a working woman, likes smoking and drinking sometimes and doesn't want to get married to anyone who asks her 'Are you a virgin?'. She is the poster girl for the recent #AintNoCinderalla campaign which ran on the social media after Chandigarh stalking case. The narrator of the film introduces her as \"Nassiyath kaano mein daal thi nahi, Achchi aadat palti nahi.\"She knows that doesn't fit the bill of an 'ideal girl' any guy would want to marry, but that won't make her change herself. As she apty puts it, \"Humara akkdu aur Akbar type ke ladko se paala padta hai, Jo pata nahi khud Ko kya samajhte hain.\" Rebellious at heart Kriti Sanon is loveable in the role of Bitti.\n\nChutney: Ayushmann Khurranna who plays Chirag Dubey in the film is meethi, theeki or any other kind of chutney you want to add to Bareilly Ki Chaat. There are too many layers and flavours to his character, as Pritam Vidrohi aka Rajkumar Rao says in the film, \"Raayata phelaya hai na, aap he samateoge.\" In the begining of the film, he is shown as a Devdas, after the girl he loved gets married off to someone else. Then falls in love with Bitti, but instead of directly confronting her with his feelings he does all kinds of conspiracies. He adds sweetness with the song Nazm Nazm, which brings Chirag and Bitti closer to each other. But then he is the mirchi who makes his 'mooh bola dost' Rajkumar Rao's character turn 'rangbaaz'. Trains him to become the guy, every girl including Bitti detests. Anything is fair in love and war, and Chirag Dubey is ready to do everything!\n\nBhalle/Papdi: Plain and simple but a must ingredient in every chaat! Rajkumar Rao's character Pritam Vidrohi is just that. You may not relish a plain bhalla or papdi but when combined with the sweetness of Bitti and spicy flavours of Chirag Dubey, you can't have enough of him. Rajkumar Rao shines bright in the film. He knows Ayushmann's character takes advantage of him, but still calls him 'bhaiya' and does whatever he says. His character has a low self esteem and is heard saying, \"Humhe aise he le chalo bhaiya, waise bhi humari amma ke ilaaa humhe koi pasand nahi karta.\" But then after a makeover, Vidrohiji is unstoppable! To put his swag to test, Chirag Dubey asks Vidrohi ji to park his bike right in the middle of the road, and then when all the traffic is honking at him, he goes and gets a pan for himself. Rajkumar Rao does it in style! Ayushmann-Rao's love-hate relationship makes for the most fun portions of the film.\u200b But in the end, 'Vidrohiji ka vidroh' brings twists and turns in the film.", "id": "9877810", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "No sugar rush!

In fact, I was also told in my initial days that there are no flaws in my appearance to look real. You still have to play a de-glam role to prove your acting skill.\"\n\nKriti says it's unfair.\n\nShe added: \"I think as an audience, for me, what interests me is how layered the character is, if there is some complexity in her character that could engage me to watch. Perfection of her appearance has got nothing to do with her personality, right?\"\n\nHowever, she believes that such things happened also depending on the fate of the film.\n\n\"Overall, if the film and your character connect with the audience, then people also notice your performance. Having said that, I know that critics start noticing our performance beyond the beauty when playing a so-called 'de-glam' role.\"\n\nKriti is playing Bitti Mishra, a girl from Uttar Pradesh, who has a contemporary outlook in \"Bareilly Ki Barfi\".\n\nAccording to the \"Dilwale\" actress, she can connect to the character very easily.\n\n\"Though Bitti is from a small town, she is a broad-minded girl. She questions every regular thing like why can't girls do this or that; she is a very rational minded person. I am also like her and that is why I could connect with her so much,\" she said.\n\nHowever, there is dissimilarity, Kriti added.\n\n\"She wants a man to get married to, who can accept her the way she is, more than anything else. When it comes to me, love has to happen to get married\" she said.\n\nThis is the first time Kriti has worked with actors Ayushmann Khuranaa and Rajkummar Rao in the Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari directorial.\n\nShe said: \"Since they come from a theatre background, their approach towards a character is quite similar and that helped me to enhance my performance; because acting is also about reacting to your co-actors.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "id": "9887327", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": " Have to play de-glam role to prove acting talent, says Kriti Sanon ", "image": "http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/common/no_preview.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "51434", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Indo-Asian News Service"}, "id": "305741", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Asian_News_Service"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dilwale (2015 film)"}, "id": "1279958", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilwale_(2015_film)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 426, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 713, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 936, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Agents and Agencies", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Agents_and_Agencies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1023, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Circus", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Circus"}], "time": "12:02:00"}

She's been caught up with a lot of promotional activities for her upcoming release titled Bareilly Ki Barfi in which she plays the protagonist Bitti. Still, there's not even the slightest sign of fatigue on her face as she sits down and sips her coffee for the Nth interview on a rainy evening.\n\nHere's part one of an exclusive conversation with Kriti on all things Bareilly Ki Barfi and more. Excerpts:\n\nI am very instinctive when it comes to deciding whether I want to do a film or not. When I'm hearing or reading the script, my first reaction is to the script is as an audience. Whether I would as an audience, want to watch that film or not because no matter how good your character is in the film, if the script doesn't connect with the audience, it doesn't matter what you've done. The main thing is to be a part of good scripts to tell good stories. Then it comes down to your character - how interesting it is or how exciting it is for you or if it's something that you've not done before and you would want to explore. Sometimes, it might be, that there are certain people attached with the film who I would love to work with in general or want to get the experience of working with them purely as an actor. It's not been (the case) till now but it might be.\n\nBefore I start the film, I would love to know who they are (chuckles). But apart from that, if the other criteria(s) match, if I'm confident about the script, I like the character that I'm playing, and I'm confident of the director to pull of the script, then it doesn't matter.\n\nDifference? That's very tricky! I think they come from a similar school, from what I could gauge. Both of them have done theatre and they have done films in this space of cinema. I can't find a difference between them...\n\nSimilarity?\n\nBoth of them are very focussed and they both always try to better their performance and add a little more to it. And I think both of them are very collaborative. We've also had many scenes where all three of us are together. There are times when three, four, five people are together, so it's a lot about rehearsing and shooting your ideas and discussing amongst yourselves what works, reacting to each other. So one more thing about them is that they're very reactive. They're very good at give-and-take because they are such good actors. If you do something which is not in the script and it comes out naturally, you know they are actors who would react to it.\n\nNo, I didn't go through training but I watched a few videos. So with Bitti also, the thing is that she's not gone through training. She's just a naturally good dancer. She's someone who likes watching videos and copying them. So because she copies videos, it's break dance but it's not authentic. It's almost like Bareilly ka break dance like desi Chinese.\n\nIt's very tricky (giggles). All the songs are really different. May be Twist Kamariya because it's the track that has got on to me first and it's come out recently so I've only been listening to that. Also, it is one song that has a lot of Bitti's character in it. It is the song that comes a little initially in the film. She's a girl, jiske bina Bareilly ka koi bhi sangeet nahi hota hai. So it's that kind of song where she gets life into everyone's celebrations. The initial swag of hers, it was Ashwiny (Iyer Tiwari)'s idea to to add that sweatshirt with the layers on it and it was my idea to add the converse with the embroidery on it. So Bitti gets established with this song and also I think Bosco (Martis) has one a fab job because I could have never thought of adding an MJ kind of step in a song like Twist Kamariya, so that is also very Bitti.\n\nRajkummar Rao's character - Pritam Vidrohi. He has the best character in the film I would say, purely because it has such a range for an actor to play a character like that. It's two extremes. It's almost like playing two characters in a film. So he's actually a very meek, scared, what we call fattu, kind of a guy who sells sarees, but he is made to act like a really mawali gunda who can be scary. So that character I'm sure the audience is really going to love and it's hilarious, the way he slips in and out of it in some scenes, because you can't fake it for too long. So that's something which is very interesting and I would love to play that.\n\nThere is a film that I have said yes to. I haven't officially signed but I've said yes to it. It should be announced soon. I always prefer it coming from the production. I think it's their right to be announcing their film. Apart from that, there are two scripts that I've heard and I might sign one of them depending on my dates.", "id": "9541350", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Exclusive Interview: Kriti Sanon aka 'Bitti' on all things 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' and more...", "image": "http://static.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/2017/08/16/601881-kriti-sanon-bareilly-ki-barfi-lead.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bitti"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "270282", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitti", "label": {"eng": "Bitti"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Song"}, "id": "302635", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Actor"}, "id": "302943", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Embroidery"}, "id": "304411", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embroidery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Theatre"}, "id": "304633", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dance"}, "id": "306425", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Koi"}, "id": "325249", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koi"}, {"label": {"eng": "B-boying"}, "id": "332081", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-boying"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sari"}, "id": "373552", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Music of India"}, "id": "374854", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_India"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barfi"}, "id": "566242", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barfi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mawla"}, "id": "887877", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawla"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 209, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 210, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education"}], "time": "18:24:00"}

She lives in a small town, works in a dingy government office and her only dream seems to be to get married. She also smokes cigarettes, watches pirated English films and break-dances. The heroine of Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari's \"Bareilly Ki Barfi\" seems interesting at first. She ruins it all by reading a book.\n\nDisappointed that she's had two broken engagements and with no prospective suitor in sight, Bitti decides to run away from her small-town existence. But while she is waiting for her train, she happens to read a pulp novel she bought at the station. The book, titled \"Bareilly Ki Barfi\", feels like it is about her - the heroine smokes, drinks and break-dances. Finally, Bitti feels like someone understands her. She goes back home and decides to find the author.\n\nHer search leads her to Chirag Dubey, (Ayushmann Khurrana), who wrote the book but didn't want to publish it in his name. So, for the sake of a token \"You've Got Mail\" plot twist, he publishes it in the name of his friend Pritam Vidrohi (Rajkummar Rao), and pretends to be the interlocutor between Bitti and her author crush.\n\nThis leads to a first-half that has some half-baked humour and warm moments between Bitti and Chirag and a hint of chemistry that adds some spark to the proceedings. But when Bitti insists on meeting the author of the book that changed her life, Chirag is forced to bring Pritam out of his hibernation. A meek, fumbling salesman who is constantly bulldozed by the more dominating Chirag, Pritam is reluctant to play his part in this love story but has little choice in the matter.\n\nThe film might have been an attempt to create a good old-fashioned love triangle, but the events leading up to it feel unnecessarily contrived, and the plot (by Nitesh Tiwari and Shreyas Jain) wafer-thin and stretched. The so-called conflict could have been resolved if the leads had an honest two-minute conversation.\n\nThankfully, the film is somewhat salvaged by Seema Pahwa and Pankaj Tripathi, who are brilliant as Bitti's parents. Pahwa as the exasperated mother whose only aim in life is to get her daughter married off is a delight to watch. It makes you wish the movie was about her and her sparring sessions with Bitti, rather than the tepid romance we are subjected to.\n\nSanon puts in an effervescent performance as Bitti and is wonderfully complemented by Rao, who brings pitch perfect comic timing to what is otherwise a truncated role. Khurrana, on the other hand, seems jaded as the jilted lover, a role he has played once before this year (\"Meri Pyaari Bindu\").\n\nBut he must get credit for the best line in the film. When Bitti feeds him a barfi (traditional Indian milk dessert) and asks him if he likes it, he replies: \"Pheeki hai\" (It is bland).

The actress plays the character of Bitti, who's been raised in a liberal environment, much like a boy in her small town household of Bareilly. Just like her character in the film, Kriti doesn't mince words while speaking her mind out. She considers herself a director's actor but at the same time believes in understanding the nuances and mindset of her character before portraying it.\n\nIn part two of an Exclusive Interview with dna, Kriti opens up about the general impression of actresses in Hindi films, how she and her parents deal with the speculations about her personal life and more. Excerpts:\n\nI think it's changing and it's changed a lot. Actresses these days are also choosing roles rather than just films. They're wanting to do different things. You see anybody, Anushka, Priyanka, Deepika, there's Kangana of course, Alia, Shraddha, Parineeti, all of them for that matter, wants to do different stuff. Everybody wants to explore a different side of themselves. It's changing a lot now. Sometimes I think it's okay to do a film where your role in terms of screenspace is not much but is still relevant to the film, it's moving the film somewhere. So, sometimes it's important to be a part of a really good script where you have a relevant role.\n\nI am completely a director's actor but having said that I like putting a lot of thought in whatever I'm doing as an actor. I would be curious about why is my character is behaving the way he or she is, or if I have some ideas in my head, if I want to do a scene in a particular way or have imagined it in a particular way, I would always approach the director and tell him or her.\n\nThere have been times, not in this film (Bareilly Ki Barfi), but in Raabta, when Dinu (Dinesh Vijan) has let us do the scene the way we wanted to and he liked it, but he thought of it differently. He told us that and we did it (his way) and that turned out to be magical. So there's no right way of looking at a scene. You may look at it in one way but someone else might have a more interesting perspective.\n\nAt the end of it, a film, as a whole is a director's vision so you can't do what you want. You can only try and understand your character the way you would want to play it or the way it's written on the paper, but there are certain things that are not written on the paper. It's collaborative with the director. I am a director's actor who would want to know what is there in the director's head.\n\nYeah! When you're on public platforms, there are many times when the journalists ask you questions about stuff that's not related to your life also. So, yes, there is a little bit of pressure of knowing everything but having said that, it's not possible to know everything. For us also, it's a daily job that we're doing and it's hectic enough, there's enough that we already need to know for the job that we're doing. It's not possible for me to be reading the newspaper everyday. There are so many days when I'm not able to, so many days when I'm outside India shooting something so I'm not in touch with anybody in India. I think it should be okay for people (to accept it) if an actor says 'I don't know', as long as you're being honest about it. I don't want to give a rubbish opinion just for the heck of it.\n\nI think it's important to express only when you have an opinion. There are so many times when we know only half the truth, we don't have complete information about what has happened but because we're asked for an opinion, at times we tend to say something. Being a public personality, whatever you say, can impact or influence your audience or your fans. So, you need to know when to talk and when not to.\n\nI feel it's really commendable that people are doing all that and taking up roles knowing that they'll have to go through all of that. But I feel whenever it's done it should be done carefully, so that it doesn't affect your body in a wrong way, so you stay healthy for a longer time. It should not be artificial, it should not be sudden. You should give yourself that kind of time to gain or lose that much amount of weight.\n\nOf course I would. I think it's a part of our job. I didn't have to go through much body transformation till now. But for the flashback portions in Raabta, I had to get much more toned than I was at that time. So I had to lose a little weight, purely because she was a warrior. From there I landed on the Bareilly Ki Barfi set and I was told to get a little cheeks, because Bitti is not really the going-to-the-gym kind of a girl. So I was back to eating jalebis and Tunday kebabs and butter chicken and what not (laughs).\n\nWhen you enter the industry one thing is for sure that you have to be thick skinned. You can't react on everything that's written or said about you. You can't let things affect you, There are so many times when there are negative stories or negativity around you, or people talking not-so-good things about you. Even in that way,of course you're human beings so it will affect you. But you need to tell yourself and you need to have a filter 'on'. Like we don't really react to all the trolls because they don't mean anything to us. They are nobody for me, so their opinion doesn't matter (smiles). So, you just need to tell all the people who are negative around you that they don't exist. Like you have the option of blocking on social media, so just block the negativity out.\n\nI think they have also become pretty used to it. So they don't really react much to it.\n\nMy parents know that I talk to them everyday and I have that kind of connect with them that if something happens in my life life actually, they would know about it and they would be the first ones to know. So that doubt is never there. Yeah sometimes when there are speculation stories that I'm doing a film or I have signed a film that I haven't, then I do get a call from my mom at times saying, 'Have you signed something and not told me?'

We still belong to a male chauvinist society. If I go to a clinic, people ask me, 'Miss or Mrs?'. I say, 'Ashwini Iyer,' because my passport has this name and Nitesh didn't want me to change my name. So, at the clinic, they asked me, 'What's your husband's name?'. I said, 'Nitesh Tiwari.' So, they said, 'So, we will put Tiwari after your name.' So, these things will always be there. That's how we have been raised. In Aadhar card, you have the father's name but not the mother's name.\"\n\nShe had added, \"I was quite upset about it. Then I thought, why am I upset about this? They don't even care if they need to have the mother's name or not. But it is not that India is not changing.

The actress plays the character of Bitti, who's been raised in a liberal environment, much like a boy in her small town household of Bareilly. Just like her character in the film, Kriti doesn't mince words while speaking her mind out. She considers herself a director's actor but at the same time believes in understanding the nuances and mindset of her character before portraying it.\n\nIn part two of an Exclusive Interview with dna, Kriti opens up about the general impression of actresses in Hindi films, how she and her parents deal with the speculations about her personal life and more. Excerpts:\n\nI think it's changing and it's changed a lot. Actresses these days are also choosing roles rather than just films. They're wanting to do different things. You see anybody, Anushka, Priyanka, Deepika, there's Kangana of course, Alia, Shraddha, Parineeti, all of them for that matter, wants to do different stuff. Everybody wants to explore a different side of themselves. It's changing a lot now. Sometimes I think it's okay to do a film where your role in terms of screenspace is not much but is still relevant to the film, it's moving the film somewhere. So, sometimes it's important to be a part of a really good script where you have a relevant role.\n\nI am completely a director's actor but having said that I like putting a lot of thought in whatever I'm doing as an actor. I would be curious about why is my character is behaving the way he or she is, or if I have some ideas in my head, if I want to do a scene in a particular way or have imagined it in a particular way, I would always approach the director and tell him or her.\n\nThere have been times, not in this film (Bareilly Ki Barfi), but in Raabta, when Dinu (Dinesh Vijan) has let us do the scene the way we wanted to and he liked it, but he thought of it differently. He told us that and we did it (his way) and that turned out to be magical. So there's no right way of looking at a scene. You may look at it in one way but someone else might have a more interesting perspective.\n\nAt the end of it, a film, as a whole is a director's vision so you can't do what you want. You can only try and understand your character the way you would want to play it or the way it's written on the paper, but there are certain things that are not written on the paper. It's collaborative with the director. I am a director's actor who would want to know what is there in the director's head.\n\nYeah! When you're on public platforms, there are many times when the journalists ask you questions about stuff that's not related to your life also. So, yes, there is a little bit of pressure of knowing everything but having said that, it's not possible to know everything. For us also, it's a daily job that we're doing and it's hectic enough, there's enough that we already need to know for the job that we're doing. It's not possible for me to be reading the newspaper everyday. There are so many days when I'm not able to, so many days when I'm outside India shooting something so I'm not in touch with anybody in India. I think it should be okay for people (to accept it) if an actor says 'I don't know', as long as you're being honest about it. I don't want to give a rubbish opinion just for the heck of it.\n\nI think it's important to express only when you have an opinion. There are so many times when we know only half the truth, we don't have complete information about what has happened but because we're asked for an opinion, at times we tend to say something. Being a public personality, whatever you say, can impact or influence your audience or your fans. So, you need to know when to talk and when not to.\n\nI feel it's really commendable that people are doing all that and taking up roles knowing that they'll have to go through all of that. But I feel whenever it's done it should be done carefully, so that it doesn't affect your body in a wrong way, so you stay healthy for a longer time. It should not be artificial, it should not be sudden. You should give yourself that kind of time to gain or lose that much amount of weight.\n\nOf course I would. I think it's a part of our job. I didn't have to go through much body transformation till now. But for the flashback portions in Raabta, I had to get much more toned than I was at that time. So I had to lose a little weight, purely because she was a warrior. From there I landed on the Bareilly Ki Barfi set and I was told to get a little cheeks, because Bitti is not really the going-to-the-gym kind of a girl. So I was back to eating jalebis and Tunday kebabs and butter chicken and what not (laughs).\n\nWhen you enter the industry one thing is for sure that you have to be thick skinned. You can't react on everything that's written or said about you. You can't let things affect you, There are so many times when there are negative stories or negativity around you, or people talking not-so-good things about you. Even in that way,of course you're human beings so it will affect you. But you need to tell yourself and you need to have a filter 'on'. Like we don't really react to all the trolls because they don't mean anything to us. They are nobody for me, so their opinion doesn't matter (smiles). So, you just need to tell all the people who are negative around you that they don't exist. Like you have the option of blocking on social media, so just block the negativity out.\n\nI think they have also become pretty used to it. So they don't really react much to it.\n\nMy parents know that I talk to them everyday and I have that kind of connect with them that if something happens in my life life actually, they would know about it and they would be the first ones to know. So that doubt is never there. Yeah sometimes when there are speculation stories that I'm doing a film or I have signed a film that I haven't, then I do get a call from my mom at times saying, 'Have you signed something and not told me?' (smiles). So I just have to tell her 'No, I heven't. Relax. I will tell you when I do.' Apart from that, they're used to it. I'm sure it's not the most pleasant thing, to be reading things that may be you don't want to or things that you don't have a control on, but they are pretty chilled out now.

Finding him though proves to be as hard as looking for a needle in the haystack. So Bitti seeks the help of the local printing press-owner, Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann) on her journey of love.\n\nReview: BKB is a hooray moment for Hindi cinema. This romcom set in the North Indian town of Bareilly, breaks the shackles of Bollywood's continued dependence on cardboard cuts and instead introduces you to real people, whose charms are infectious. The writers Nitesh Tiwari (director and writer of the much-acclaimed blockbuster Dangal )and Shreyas Jain have put together a sweet, identifiable crowd-pleaser that excels in the writing, direction, acting and music departments.\n\nAs far as performances go--Rajkummar Rao is the scene-stealer. Whether he's the stammering sari salesman or the gali ka gunda, he is magnetic.\n\nKriti Sanon makes for a lovable Bitti and beti, while Ayushmann goes from white to grey so effortlessly you stay invested in him. Pankaj Tripathi and Seema Pahwa are also in fine fettle and you're actually tempted to ask them for an encore.\n\nAshwiny Iyer Tiwari who won notices for her directorial debut Nil Battey Sannata, is in top form again. She puts heart into this comedy and the flawless writing makes it that much more effective.\n\nEvery time you guffaw at the antics of the lead and supporting cast, you are reminded that there is so much humour in our daily routine which we have forgotten to stop and savour.\n\nComing back to the protagonist, Bitti, she's the only daughter of a sweetmeat shop owner (Pankaj) and his conservative wife (Seema). Her dad raises her like a son, even allowing her the occasional puff and swig. In sharp contrast, her regular small-town Ma, who only wants to see her daughter hitched.\n\nOn a train journey, Bitti accidentally ends up devouring a novel titled Bareilly Ki Barfi and here comes a twist in the tale. Not only does she identify with the lead character of the book, she also desperately seeks the author. She starts spending a lot of time with Chirag, they become besties, too, and he promises to help find her Pritam-pyaare.\n\nJaved Akhtar's voice-over introducing the characters and situations is breezy, once again thanks to the funny punches. Quite like the money-spinner Tanu Weds Manu and its sequel, this film too keeps you invested in its rain and shine moments. As a bonus you get the peppy Sweety Tera Drama and Twist Kamariya tracks, both of which will get you grooving.

It was a failed literary debut, but it transforms Bittu's life.\n\nThe comedy of errors and garbled identities is unleashed when she sets out to meet Vidrohi in person.\n\nKhurrana plays the wily Chirag Dubey, the seemingly affable guy who promises to help Bitti meet her dream author.\n\nThe first half is dominated by Khurrana and Sanon's blossoming friendship, but it's the second half that holds the real punch.\n\nThe arrival of Rao as the meek, submissive salesman who can turn on the swag and attitude sporadically is a treat to watch. His chemistry with Khurrana -- who reveals his grey shades -- is spot-on and the portions where they interact are the highlights of this romantic comedy.\n\nFinally, here's a Hindi film whose second half doesn't disappoint and unravel into a total mess. While the first half is predictable and adheres closely to the trailer, the scenes after the interval are delightful. The climax where you guess which man walks away with the woman may be predictable, but there's no taking away from Iyer Tiwari's knack for telling a good story in an engaging manner.\n\nSanon, as the spunky small-towner, is pretty pleasing to the eye, but isn't wholly convincing as she looks polished, urbane and worldly-wise in some of the scenes. But her earnestness makes up for those flaws.\n\nBut I would be lying if I didn't tell you that I was mulling over the possibility of what an actor like Kangna Ranaut could have done with such a role.\n\nBut that shouldn't be a deal breaker. Both the men -- Khurrana and Rao -- are in good form as they spar vulgarly to get the woman of their dreams. What the woman, Bitti, wants is not fully explored, but that shouldn't be a turn-off.\n\nIyer Tiwari has deftly painted the middle-class milieu of UP with the crutch of reliable actors such as Pankaj Tripathi, who plays Bitti's liberal father.\n\nWhile it takes time for Bareilly Ki Barfi to warm up to you, the crackling second half and the arrival of Rao signals for good things to come. Watch this if you are in the mood to unwind with a romantic comedy filled with an endearing set of flawed, but sweet individuals.", "id": "9695266", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "'Bareilly Ki Barfi' film review: Rajkummar Rao shines in this romcom", "image": "http://static.gulfnews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2075783!/image/4027601246.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_460346/4027601246.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "51434", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bitti"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "270282", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitti", "label": {"eng": "Bitti"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film"}, "id": "302814", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Comedy"}, "id": "302913", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sexism"}, "id": "306079", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bollywood"}, "id": "312308", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Matriarchy"}, "id": "329185", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy film"}, "id": "331553", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Romance film"}, "id": "332398", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kangna Ranaut"}, "id": "346947", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangna_Ranaut"}, {"label": {"eng": "Patriarchy"}, "id": "348230", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tiwari"}, "id": "390158", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pride and Prejudice"}, "id": "395088", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}, "id": "469210", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 426, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 576, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 974, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy"}], "time": "13:15:00"}

While the actress received a lot of praise for her glamorous look and beautiful screen presence when it comes to her performance as an actress, she did not receive any positive review from the critics.\n\nKriti Sanon on getting typecast in Bollywood!In the three-year-old career in Bollywood, Kriti recently revealed how she was \"typecast\" or \"bracketed\" right after her second release 'Dilwale'.\n\nAsked about such opinion about her acting skill, Kriti said, \"Yes, the general perception still is that if you have a pretty face, you are a bad actor. In fact, I was also told in my initial days that there are no flaws in my appearance to look real. You still have to play a de-glam role to prove your acting skill.\" Kriti says it's unfair.\n\nShe added, \"I think as an audience, for me, what interests me is how layered the character is, if there is some complexity in her character that could engage me to watch. Perfection of her appearance has got nothing to do with her personality, right?\" However, she believes that such things happened also depending on the fate of the film.\n\n\"Overall, if the film and your character connect with the audience, then people also notice your performance. Having said that, I know that critics start noticing our performance beyond the beauty when playing a so-called 'de-glam' role.\" Kriti is playing Bitti Mishra, a girl from Uttar Pradesh, who has a contemporary outlook in 'Bareilly Ki Barfi'.\n\nAccording to the 'Dilwale' actress, she can connect to the character very easily. \"Though Bitti is from a small town, she is a broad-minded girl. She questions every regular thing like why can't girls do this or that; she is a very rational minded person. I am also like her and that is why I could connect with her so much,\" she said.\n\nHowever, there is dissimilarity, Kriti added. \"She wants a man to get married to, who can accept her the way she is, more than anything else. When it comes to me, love has to happen to get married\" she said.\n\nThis is the first time Kriti has worked with actors Ayushmann Khuranaa and Rajkummar Rao in the Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari directorial. She said, \"Since they come from a theatre background, their approach towards a character is quite similar and that helped me to enhance my performance; because acting is also about reacting to your co-actors.\"\n\nBareilly Ki Barfi Food Challenge Ft.

The apple of her father's eye, she is the quintessential tomboy, who works in the electricity department, smokes, drinks, does break dance, stays out late and watches English films all of which her mother disapproves of.\n\nBeing rejected by boys who come to see her for marriage, becomes her pet peeve as that causes her mother anguish. Dejected, Bitti sets out to leave home.\n\nBy happenstance, she picks up a book, 'Bareilly ki Barfi', from the book stall at the station, which changes her life. She returns home and begins her search for the author, Pritam Vidrohi, as she feels the protagonist in his novel is her carbon copy and he is thus someone who would understand her.\n\nHow she uses Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann Khurrana), the publisher of the book, in her quest, forms the crux of this two hour film.\n\nThe characters and their lives are introduced to the audience through a narrative by Javed Akhtar in the beginning of the film. The characters are well-etched and developed thoughtfully with consistency.\n\nNitesh Tiwari's sharp writing laced with humour encapsulates the simplicity and warmth of a small town, which is evident in each scene through his characters.\n\nDirector Ashwini Iyer Tiwari keeps the characters and their milieu real. It is the ace writing coupled with the strong performances that elevate the viewing experience further.\n\nRajkumar as Pritam Vidrohi is spectacular as he is every inch the small town, timid, boy who leads a basic life. He slips into the aggressive gunda avatar with equal ease and aplomb, altering his body language and mannerisms perfectly. He steals the thunder from every other actor in the film and is immensely endearing.\n\nAyushmann delivers with sincerity and the metamorphosis of a heart-broken boy to a boy madly in love and finally a guy who has lost his love is palpable and praiseworthy. Yet, he pales in comparison to Rajkummar.\n\nKriti portrays Bitti with confidence and honesty. She is charming and holds her own although she is pitted against two good male actors.\n\nSeema Pahwa as the gregarious mother, desperate to get Bitti married, if only to comply with societal norms, is a treat to watch. Pankaj Tripathi, renders an equally stellar performance as her subservient husband, who supports his daughter, but maintains a silence to keep the peace in the house prevailing, venting out his feelings to the ceiling fan at night.\n\nRohit Chaudhary who plays Munna, Chirag's devoted lackey is a competent actor as well and shines.\n\nThe film is well-mounted and is true to its setting. The music is melodious and 'Sweety tera drama' is well-picturised and energetic.\n\nThe screenplay and dialogues are what take this film to another level. Else, the basic tale is fairly ordinary and cliched.

He smells alcohol on her breath but shrugs it off. He even bums cigarettes from her when he exhausts his own stock. Then there is the mother Susheela (Seema Pahwa), who might call her a chudail (witch) for roaming around recklessly in the night but doesn't appear to impose any curbs on her. Is this parent-daughter bonding for real or some sort of wish fulfilment, deliberate tokenism or a genuinely nuanced portrayal? We may keep arguing endlessly on it, we may even carp about the constant stress on having brought up the girl up \"like a boy\"; nonetheless it does feel refreshing and hatke. Be it Farooque Sheikh in Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani or Seema Pahwa in Dum Laga Ke Haisha or the Pahwa-Tripathi combine now in Bareilly Ki Barfi -- the changing face of parenthood in Hindi cinema is worth a closer, more critical look, but that's for another article.\n\nDespite two seemingly progressive, non-interfering parents Bitti feels stifled. Because marriage is still the ultimate goal -- both for her and her parents -- and liberal young men are hard to come by. They want to know if she is a virgin. No such questions would be asked if she were a boy, says Bitti. She finds empathy in author Pritam Vidrohi who has created a character quite like her in his novel Bareilly Ki Barfi. She promptly falls for the idea of Vidrohi (which literally translates to rebel) without having met him. After all, he finds khoobi (goodness) even in her aib (flaws). But the author Vidrohi is actually a printing press owner -- Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann Khurrana) -- who is battling his own love demons. And the real Vidrohi (Rajkummar Rao) is a meek sari salesman who can't quite string two sentences together. Confusion gets confounded, a case of mistaken identities follows but eventually all ends predictably well.\n\nIn many ways BKB is reminiscent of the middle class, comedy of errors that were built on trifles -- Sai Paranjape's Chashme Buddoor or Katha, Basu Chatterjee's Chhoti Si Baat or Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Chupke Chupke and Kissi Se Na Kehna. What continues to be in the spirit of these classic comedies is the odd fun with the wordplay and some nicely realised moments, like the love games in the boat ride where a suicide spot is pointed out by the boatman -- \"Yahan 72 aashiqon ne jal samadhi li hai\" (Here lies the grave of 72 doomed lovers). What has changed is the relocation of the romedies, from cities to small towns, perhaps because that urban, middle class of the films of yore has transformed too radically to be the backdrop for such stories any more.\n\nSo you have the small town packaged in all its panoramic grandeur and Eastman colour. Visually Lucknow and Bareilly can be as fetching as Switzerland. If you are looking for acute social realism then this Bareilly is not for you. It is meant to be a backdrop for some romance and fun, for consumption in urban multiplexes, meant to surprise urban viewers in whose imagination small towns continue to be \"conservative\" rather than spaces whereas in reality, a \"sexual revolution\" could be in full swing.\n\nIt's the parents, along with a host of other characters around the lead protagnists, who inject life into BKB. The so-called supporting cast is key to BKB, as in countless other films of late -- be it Chirag's friend or Vidrohi's mom. Rao is a hoot and brings the house down with his chameleon turn and comic timing -- simpering simpleton one minute, full of swagger the next; a role that could have become a caricature in the hands of a lesser actor. Tripathi is mesmerising with his seeming effortlessness in inhabiting the role of the idiosyncratic father. Hear him talk to the fan, assessing the suitor for his daughter -- \"even if good for nothing he would at least be able to swat flies in the sweet shop\" -- and it's hard not to smile indulgently. Pahwa's mother feels like a carry forward of the sex-advisor mom of Dum Laga Ke... but she still makes things absolutely fresh and riveting, specially when she tries to hook a suitor for her daughter with a glass of sharbat. You can't look at the natty Sanon when Pahwa shares the frame with her. In fact, it's the lead pair who render things utterly plastic -- Sanon seems planted into the milieu than belonging to it while Khurrana is oddly low key and colourless despite having been at ease in a similar setting in Dum Laga Ke...\n\nThe mediocre music and song-n-dance routines bring in the typical filmi touch to the film trying hard to fight it but still wanting to remain within it. Although a likeable film, BKB is one that could have but doesn't quite fly.", "id": "9884412", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Bareilly Ki Barfi review: Romedy of errors", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/article19517129.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bareilly%20Ki%20Barfi", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "53310", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bollywood"}, "id": "312308", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chameleon"}, "id": "326853", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chameleon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sari"}, "id": "373552", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}, "id": "384764", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tiwari"}, "id": "390158", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwari"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}, "id": "417054", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Farooq Sheikh"}, "id": "423908", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farooq_Sheikh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hrishikesh Mukherjee"}, "id": "423940", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrishikesh_Mukherjee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chashme Buddoor (1981 film)"}, "id": "423953", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chashme_Buddoor_(1981_film)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pritam Chakraborty"}, "id": "433799", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritam_Chakraborty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani"}, "id": "456283", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeh_Jawaani_Hai_Deewani"}, {"label": {"eng": "Basu Chatterjee"}, "id": "710916", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basu_Chatterjee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pankaj Tripathi"}, "id": "800555", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Tripathi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chhoti Si Baat"}, "id": "858347", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhoti_Si_Baat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kissi Se Na Kehna"}, "id": "966515", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissi_Se_Na_Kehna"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chupke Chupke"}, "id": "966516", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chupke_Chupke"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dum Laga Ke Haisha"}, "id": "1279795", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dum_Laga_Ke_Haisha"}, {"label": {"eng": "Seema Bhargava"}, "id": "1440464", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seema_Bhargava"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 8, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 180, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 189, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 192, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 211, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Men", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Men"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}], "time": "11:45:00"}

So, there's nothing new to showcase here other than the subtly mannered treatment.\n\nWe've seen far too many triangular love stories to be enchanted by that old hat ploy but the thing that distinguishes Iyer Tiwari's film from the past is the persuasive small-town sensibility, the rustic lure of the vibrant folksy music and the relatively non-glam casting of the main male leads. Of course, Kriti Sanon, though competent does seem like a misfit in a small town where her professionally cosmetised looks stand out like a sore thumb.\n\nShe plays Bitty, a misfit tomboy in small-town Bareilly- who drinks, smokes, roams the streets at night and just about does everything that takes her fancy. Her Mithaiwala Dad (Pankaj Tripathi) is supportive but her eager-to-see-her-wed Mom (Seema Bhargava Pahwa) is not amused. It's not a pattern of behaviour that is immediately believable mainly because the parents are way too liberal in the encouragement of it. And it's certainly not progressive by any yardstick.\n\nBitty chances upon a novelette titled 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' in which the central character is based on her life. All the personality traits are a match so she wants to find the author. Of course, like in 'Saajan' the author credited for the work Pritam Vidrohi (Rajkummar Rao) is not the real deal. The justification for that turn of events is also quite inadequate. The real author Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann Khurrana) could well have used a pseudonym instead. So, it's obvious that contrivances have been employed to create enough drama to justify this production of an oft-repeated story.\n\nSo, whatever happens after that feels forced and doesn't seem in the least bit organic.\n\nIt's the energy displayed by both Rajkummar Rao and Ayushmann Khurrana that keeps this eventual quadrangular love story afloat for its 135-min runtime. The characterizationsns are weak and shifty and the logic doesn't stand up to close scrutiny. The music is vibrant and entertaining and the colourful camerawork allows for some much-needed kinesis to creep in. Iyer Tiwari may not have hit the highs she displayed in her debut work Nil Battey Sannata but she certainly shows us that she has the craft to keep us entertained even if the subject matter is pretty much pass\u00e9.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 100, "id": 7, "label": "dmoz/Arts"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing", "wgt": 100, "id": 245, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 100, "id": 246, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Authors", "wgt": 100, "id": 251, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Authors"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Casting,_Molding,_Machining", "wgt": 100, "id": 312, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Casting, Molding, Machining"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bareilly", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bareilly"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55296"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhuri_Dixit", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "312304", "label": {"eng": "Madhuri Dixit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "323128", "label": {"eng": "Salman Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "332398", "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayushmann_Khurrana", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "384764", "label": {"eng": "Ayushmann Khurrana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriti_Sanon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "417054", "label": {"eng": "Kriti Sanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Dutt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "423925", "label": {"eng": "Sanjay Dutt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "469210", "label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saajan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "527376", "label": {"eng": "Saajan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Tripathi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "800555", "label": {"eng": "Pankaj Tripathi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_D'Souza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1354442", "label": {"eng": "Lawrence D'Souza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seema_Bhargava", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1440464", "label": {"eng": "Seema Bhargava"}}]}], "totalResults": 86, "pages": 86}}}

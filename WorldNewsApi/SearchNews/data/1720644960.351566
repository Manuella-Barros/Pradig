{"id": 231312894, "title": "Carroll Yesteryears: Union Mills Homestead exhibit views democracy through one family&#8217;s eyes", "text": "The Union Mills Homestead is happy to host a new temporary exhibit exploring the Shriver family\u2019s political history. \u201cLiving Democracy\u201d is a look at the day-to-day of campaigns and elections through the words and eyes of the Shrivers. The Homestead was home to the Shriver family for six generations over more than a century and a half. They were an influential family in what would become Carroll County and deeply involved in politics. Using rarely seen documents and artifacts, \u201cLiving Democracy\u201d explores both what it was like to live through democracy, and how democracy itself is a living thing that changes over time. The co-founder of the Homestead in 1797, Andrew K. Shriver was a postmaster, justice of the peace, and a local luminary for the Jeffersonian Republicans in the early 1800s. He could be vociferous in his defense of Republican principles and in attacking his Federalist opponents through the partisan newspaper he co-published, the Frederick Hornet. His grandson, Louis E. Shriver, carried on the tradition as a member of the Carroll County Anti-Prohibition Committee, and spoke before Congress on behalf of local farmers pressing their own hard cider. In an original 1802 letter written to Andrew K. Shriver, a fellow political influencer discusses potential candidates the opposing party is considering, and how they might maneuver to select an opponent. Strong supporters of William Henry Harrison, the Shrivers were disappointed when he died only 31 days after assuming the presidency. Unhappy when Vice President John Tyler took his place, they supported Henry Clay in the 1844 election. Their enthusiasm for Clay is expressed in a handwritten draft campaign poster, complete with a lengthy patriotic song or poem. Among the rarest objects on display are party tickets from the 1852 and 1872 elections. These bookmark-sized objects list the candidates running for local offices in Carroll County\u2019s 3rd Election District. On some the Shrivers tallied vote counts for specific candidates, and on the 1872 Republican Party ticket they poked fun at Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s defeated opponent for the presidential campaign: \u201cWho cares for Greeley now!\u201d Diaries also give us a glimpse at the Shriver family\u2019s thoughts on elections. Mary Winebrenner Shriver recounts in her 1900 diary the celebrations following the election of President McKinley. In red ink, she emphasized, \u201cJoy every where., a tremendous rejoicing \u2212 every where.\u201d Her son, Harry, and brother-in-law, Louis, \u201cwent to Westminster, was there until two, came home, was so hoarse from Hurrahing could scarcely speak loud.\u201d That same Louis E. Shriver who shouted himself hoarse in 1900 lamented in 1912 that Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s Bull Moose Party spoiled the ticket for his party: \u201cMore than the election, of [Woodrow] Wilson I regret the apparent ascindency [sic] of the Roosevelt element. The Republicans will evidently be at sea for some time.\u201d An original portrait hangs in the exhibit showing the stately T. Herbert Shriver. As a teenager, young Shriver rode with J.E.B. Stuart\u2019s cavalry to Gettysburg and later fought with the Virginia Military Institute cadets (Confederate) during the Civil War. As an adult, he became far more famous as a state politician for the Democratic Party. A presidential elector, legislator, and briefly considered for governor, T. Herbert Shriver earned the honorific \u201cGeneral\u201d for his support of Democratic governors in Annapolis. How we cast our ballots can reflect our values and our concerns. An original glass ballot box did little to give privacy to the individual voter, but multiple seals on both the box itself and the wooden box it was transported in show that election integrity was a priority in years past. Only with legitimate rising concerns about voter intimidation was the privacy of the voter protected and glass ballot boxes were retired. For centuries our nation has prided itself on allowing the people to exercise their right to self-determination. Following an imperfect path, our democracy has changed through the years, and we continue to strive for a more perfect system that truly reflects the will of the people. The Shrivers of the Union Mills Homestead give us a rare opportunity to follow that path. Join us throughout 2024 to explore our \u201cLiving Democracy.\u201d Kyle Dalton is the executive director of the Union Mills Homestead Foundation.", "summary": "The Union Mills Homestead hosts a new temporary exhibit exploring the Shriver family\u2019s political history. \u201cLiving Democracy\u201d is a look at the day-to-day of campaigns and elections through the words and eyes of the Shrivers.", "url": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/2024/06/08/carroll-yesteryears-union-mills-homestead-exhibit-views-democracy-through-one-familys-eyes/", "image": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CCT-L-Yesteyears-1872-Republican-Ticket.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:30:36", "author": "Kyle Dalton", "authors": ["Kyle Dalton"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.417}

Send your letters to letters@bangordailynews.com\n\nFor many young people, summer is a season to consider job opportunities. Some may simply want to earn some extra money while others see a chance to gain some experience to ready them for a good-paying job.\n\nThe good news is that registered apprenticeships offer a way to do both.\n\nApprenticeships have long been a proven, earn-as-you-learn method for creating pathways for young people to get a head-start toward a good career. They also address the needs of employers in many, many industries for skilled workers to remain competitive and grow their businesses.\n\nWith these benefits in mind, the U.S. Department of Labor is focused on ensuring that high-quality registered apprenticeship programs are available for the next generation of workers. Our \"Youth Employment Works\" strategy connects the public workforce system with public and private sector partners to promote and expand these programs.\n\nCurrently, about one-third of the approximately 900,000 registered apprentices who served in 2023 were people, ages 16 to 24, in industries like construction and manufacturing, where apprenticeships have long been successful, as well as in high-growth industries such as information technology, cybersecurity, health care, gaming and graphic design, engineering and artificial intelligence.\n\nTo increase these numbers, we're investing millions through Apprenticeship Building America and Youth Apprenticeship Intermediary grants and strengthening the nation's long established Job Corps program to give young people pre-apprenticeship opportunities, including placements in good-paying union jobs.\n\nTo show the importance of these efforts, the department's Employment and Training Administration will celebrate the inaugural Youth Apprenticeship Week from May 5-11 in 2024. Across the nation, employers, educational institutions, labor unions, community-based organizations, workforce partners, government agencies and others will host events to raise awareness of registered apprenticeship career opportunities for young people. In fact, there is an in-person event in Limestone planned to spread the good news about the value of registered apprenticeships:\n\nWhere: Loring Job Corps Center, Montana Road, Limestone, ME 04750\n\nWe encourage you to learn more about Youth Apprenticeship Week and find an event near you.

Current apprentices and graduates of Registered Apprenticeship programs will share their experiences and success stories.\n\nYouth Apprenticeship Week is an opportunity for employers, industry associations, labor organizations, community-based organizations, workforce partners, education providers, and government leaders to host events, launch new programs, and raise awareness of these life-changing Registered Apprenticeship career opportunities for youth and young adults and how they create a sustainable pipeline of skilled and diverse talent for the jobs of today and tomorrow for critical industries.\n\nAttendees will hear how youth and young adults can utilize Registered Apprenticeships to earn competitive wages while obtaining training and skills to grow and advance in careers essential for today's workforce and jobs of the future. Registered Apprenticeships result in a nationally recognized credential and may include the chance to earn college credit and often a degree at no expense to the apprentice.\n\n\"Youth Apprenticeship Week recognizes the Biden-Harris administration's commitment to creating employment opportunities for youth and young adults and the critical role they play in our nation's workforce infrastructure,\" said Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su in a statement announcing the event. \"Youth apprenticeships are not just pathways to careers; they are bridges to futures filled with promise, opportunity, and endless potential,\" she emphasized.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor is hosting two events during Youth Apprenticeship Week, including a Kickoff event with Youth Apprentice Trailblazers on May 6 and a special Signing Day event with new youth apprentices on May 9. These events highlight careers in a range of fields important to America's success, including construction, transportation, advanced manufacturing and clean energy, education, cybersecurity, robotics, and healthcare. Youth apprenticeship is an earn-and-learn strategy that gives young people a pathway into a good job, and a jump-start into a well-paying career. Under the Biden-Harris administration, more than 1.4 million apprentices have been served, including more than 541,000 new youth and young adults ages 16 to 24 years, according to the US Department of Labor's Office of Apprenticeship, the government agency responsible for Registered Apprenticeship programs.\n\nFor more information about Youth Apprenticeship Week and how to participate, visit www.apprenticeship.gov.

But what else is there? More and more, students, workers, and employers are seeking new ways to pursue employment and success that involve other education and training pathways.\n\nThese fresh approaches include creating apprenticeships -- particularly youth apprenticeships -- that integrate paid, on-the-job training with formal classroom instruction. This pathway replaces the traditional college campus experience with a school and workplace campus experience.\n\nAs we observe National Youth Apprenticeship Week, it's time to get the lay of this changing landscape and recognize the opportunities it provides.\n\nA Wall Street Journal-NORC poll reports that more than half of Americans (56%) think a degree is not worth the cost. Tellingly, the most prominent skeptics are between 18 and 34 years old -- with college degree holders \"among those whose opinions have soured the most,\" writes Douglas Belkin of the Journal.\n\nIt's easy to understand why.\n\nA study by Burning Glass Institute and Strada Education Network surveying more than 60 million workers with bachelor's degrees and millions of online job postings found that 45% of college graduates were underemployed ten years after graduating in jobs not requiring a degree. Moreover, employers are eliminating the college degree as the gatekeeper credential for jobs, shifting from degree-based to skills-based hiring.\n\nAmericans both need and want alternative education and training pathways to employment and adult success -- foremost among which are apprenticeships for young people. Two Harris polls sponsored by the American Staffing Association found that more than 9 in 10 (92%) Americans view apprenticeships favorably. More than 6 in 10 (62%) say they make people more employable than going to college.\n\nGen Z high schoolers agree. A poll sponsored by the nonprofit Educational Credit Management Corporation reports that half (51%) of today's high schoolers are considering a college degree -- a drop of more than ten percentage points from before the pandemic. More than 6 in 10 (65%) say learning after high school should be done on the job through internships or apprenticeships.\n\nThe federal government's authority to register and oversee apprenticeship programs dates from the 1937 National Apprenticeship Act, allowing states to register and manage programs. Today, about half the states exercise that option. These registered apprenticeship programs require individuals to obtain paid work experience, receive wage increases, participate in classroom instruction, and be awarded a nationally recognized credential. They differ from internships, generally short-term, entry-level, unpaid jobs that do not lead to an industry credential.\n\nToday, 27,000 registered programs enroll over 594,000 individuals whose average age is 29, with roughly 70% in construction trades. However, that is only 0.3% of the workforce, placing the U.S. at the bottom of apprenticeship enrollment among developed countries.\n\nYouth apprenticeships, in contrast, are a newer form of apprenticeships with no federal definition. State laws define them and often include some characteristics of registered programs. For example, youth apprenticeships include work-based learning with classroom instruction, though instruction typically involves dual enrollment across high schools and postsecondary institutions.\n\nYouth apprenticeships are often not paid, while registered apprenticeships are paid. Finally, youth apprenticeships predominate in fields like advanced manufacturing, information technology, and logistics, unlike the adult focus on construction trades. The digital news hub Work Shift dubs these \"new collar apprenticeships.\"\n\nPromisingly, youth apprenticeship programs have bipartisan backing across states as diverse politically as California, Colorado, New York, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas.\n\nA report from New America identifies five types of youth apprenticeship programs: state-level, registered (federal apprenticeship) programs, public and private partnerships, high school pathways programs, and experimental pilot programs. All typically include some combination of school, employer, and post-secondary institutional partnerships, often coordinated by an organization called an apprenticeship intermediary. Another New America report documents how these go-between organizations are using technology to strengthen and expand these programs.\n\nAll signs point towards these programs continuing to grow. The Labor Department's Employment and Training Administration is launching a first-ever Federal Youth Apprentice Pathway pilot program to model how federal agencies can partner with organizations to create career pathways to federal jobs. And the U.S. Congress is considering several bipartisan apprenticeship bills, including a first-ever Youth Apprenticeship Advancement Act -- a grant program to expand youth apprenticeships for school districts and employers.\n\nTo maximize their potential, youth apprenticeships can and should be integrated into at least two noteworthy education initiatives: career education and apprenticeship degrees. The former helps lay the foundation for successful apprenticeships; the latter gives them a clear direction and payoff.\n\nPreparing individuals for apprenticeships should begin when a child enters school and should continue through middle and high school. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has studied career education programs internationally and documented an approach that spans preschool through high school organized by three categories:\n\nAnother approach to career education is Colorado's work-based learning continuum for middle and high school students, which is organized by workplace activities: learning about work, learning through work, and learning at work. These and similar approaches help young people develop knowledge and skills, social and professional networks, and the capacity to navigate pathways that turn ambitions into reality.\n\nWhile career education programs position students for successful apprenticeships, apprenticeship degrees expand their opportunities on the tail end. They reflect the fact that apprenticeships need not conflict with traditional higher education. They can be part of dual education programs that allow individuals to be apprentices and attend college. For example, the United Kingdom has developed an apprenticeship degree, an earn-and-learn program that takes three to six years and leads to a debt-free bachelor's or master's degree.\n\nThis degree-granting model is being adopted in U.S. K-12 education to create debt-free teacher apprenticeships that award bachelor's and master's degrees. Currently, 28 states and the District of Columbia are approved by the U.S. Department of Labor to offer these programs, with at least twenty-five school districts participating.\n\nCombining apprenticeships with higher education also allows colleges to \"unbundle\" the four-year degree into building blocks, or stackable credentials, earned while working. Some colleges are creating pathway degrees earned while working, leading to new types of associate or bachelor's degrees.\n\nAmericans want K-12 schools, colleges, employers, and other stakeholders to think differently about success -- and creatively about attaining it. The goal is no longer \"college for all\" but opportunity pluralism, where many pathways lead to human flourishing. In refusing to equalize opportunity along the single college route for all, the new apprenticeship paradigm makes the nation's opportunity structure more pluralistic.\n\nThis new opportunity agenda is different from the old vocational education that placed students into different tracks based chiefly on family background. That sorting process often carried racial, ethnic, and class biases. While middle- and upper-class white students sat in academic, college-preparatory classes, immigrants, low-income youth, and students of color typically were enrolled in low-level academic and vocational training. The new apprenticeship approach opens new doors rather than constraining individuals' choices.\n\nThis opportunity program also has social and psychological benefits for individuals. Apprenticeships allow individuals to develop clarity about who they are and their interests, values, and abilities, helping them build their occupational identity and vocational self. Practically, apprenticeship programs create faster and cheaper pathways to jobs and careers.\n\nThese programs are built on an opportunity equation that includes what individuals know (knowledge) and whom they know (relationships). They build profitable knowledge and priceless relationships. Today's apprenticeship models make the workplace the new campus. Celebrating National Youth Apprenticeship Week gives many Americans the occasion to agree it's about time.\n\nSome organizations mentioned in this article receive financial support from the Walton Family Foundation.

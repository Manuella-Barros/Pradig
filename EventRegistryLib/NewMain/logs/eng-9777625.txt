The amendments have been proposed to the Section 66 and Section 104 of the Election Act, 2017.\n\nAfter tabling the bill in the house, Law Minister Nazir Tarar recommended the bill be referred to the standing committee, which Speaker Sadiq subsequently did, instructing the committee chairman to convene a meeting the following day.\n\n\"Provided further that an independent candidate shall not be considered as the candidate of any political party if at later stage he files a statement duly signed and notarised stating that he contested the general elections as a candidate of the political party specified therein,\" read the bill.\n\nThe bill also proposed that political parties who failed to submit list of the reserved seats within the stipulated time to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) will not be eligible for the reserved seats.\n\n\"Provided further that if any political party fails to submit its list for reserved seats within the aforesaid prescribed time period, it shall not be eligible for the quota in the reserved seats at later stage,\" the bill stated.\n\nMoreover, it proposed that any candidate will be considered as an independent candidate if they fail to submit declaration for affiliation with a political party before seeking the allotment of an election symbol. \"Provided that if a candidate, before seeking allotment of a prescribed symbol, has not filed a declaration before the returning officer about his affiliation with a particular political party by submitting party certificate from the political party confirming that he is that party's candidate, he shall be deemed to be considered as an independent candidate and not a candidate of any political party,\" the bill read.\n\n\"This Act shall come into force at once and shall be deemed to have taken effect on and from the commencement of the Elections Act, 2017,\" the bill also explains.\n\nThe amendment bill was tabled amid strong criticism from the opposition benches.\n\nUnder this initiative, the government manoeuvring to obstructing PTI's assembly oath-taking, even though the first day of the session is typically reserved for private matters. This move could prevent PTI members from taking their oath despite the Election Commission's notification under which these members have been declared part of PTI following the apex court decision.\n\nThe development is the latest in the reserved seats saga.\n\nIn a unique majority verdict, the Supreme Court on July 12 had declared the PTI eligible to receive reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the national and provincial assemblies, giving it a new lease on life in the legislature by declaring it to be a parliamentary party.\n\nDespite an 8-5 split, all 13 judges declared the PTI a parliamentary party.\n\nThe majority judgement explained that 39 out of the 80 MNAs, shown by the ECP as PTI candidates, belonged to the party.\n\nThe rest of the 41 independents would have to file duly signed and notarised statements before the commission within 15 days, explaining that they contested the February 8 general elections as a candidate of a particular political party.\n\nThe ECP had finally decided on July 19 to implement the apex court's decision. The ECP partially implemented the Supreme Court's ruling last week, notifying 39 of the 80 returned MNAs as PTI lawmakers, after an inordinate delay.\n\nFor the remaining 41 lawmakers, the ECP submitted a document to the Supreme Court seeking guidance on verifying their affiliation in the absence of the party's organisational structure.\n\nAdditionally, the Pakistan National Excellence Institute Bill 2024 was passed during the session. Amjad Ali Khan of the Sunni Ittehad Council presented a bill to criminalise enforced disappearances, which was also referred to the standing committee.\n\nFurther, the West Pakistan Maintenance of Public Order Amendment Bill was presented by Sahibzada Sibghatullah and referred to the relevant committee by the speaker.

It was referred to the committee concerned.\n\nSince the July 12 judgment of the apex court makes the PTI eligible for the reserved seats post-general elections, the bill stipulates that the proposed act shall be deemed to have taken effect on and from the commencement of the Elections Act, 2017.\n\nThe apex court had directed the independent lawmakers to submit affidavits of their party affiliation with the 15 days of the judgment. It would then lead to the distribution of the reserved seats among the political parties.\n\nIf all those lawmakers who have been given a chance to join the PTI, it will change the composition of the National Assembly by making the former ruling party as the single largest party and depriving the ruling coalition of two-thirds majority.\n\nResultantly, the government challenged the decision, and announced that the PTI would be banned and high treason proceedings would be initiated against former prime minister Imran Khan, former president Arif Alvi and former deputy speaker Qasim Suri.\n\nNow, the ruling party's member has presented the bill, apparently, to create hindrance in the smooth implementation of the judgment as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), despite raising objections to the verdict, had announced through a press release to implement it.\n\nIt all started after the ECP had distributed reserved seats among other political parties on the ground that PTI, which was sitting in the assembly under the banner of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), had not submitted the list of its candidates, among other things, for the reserved seats.\n\nSubsequently, the decision was challenged and, initially, upheld by the Peshawar High Court but, later on, set aside by the top court.\n\nKayani not only sought amendments to the Section 66 (Candidate to file certificate of party affiliation) and 104 (party lists for reserved seats) but insertion of new section - 104-A - and provisos in the ECP Act, 2017.\n\nThrough the amendment in Section 66, he has sought addition of the expression: \"Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or any other law for the time being in force or any judgment, decree, or order of any court including the Supreme Court and a High Court, a contesting\" for the words \"A contesting\".\n\nHe has also sought addition of provisos: Provided that if a candidate, before seeking allotment of a prescribed symbol, has not filed a declaration before the Returning Officer about his affiliation with a particular political party by submitting party certificate from the political party confirming that he is that party's candidate, he shall be deemed to be considered as an independent candidate and not a candidate of any political party\".\n\nIt adds: \"Provided further that an independent candidate shall not be considered as the candidate of any political party if at later stage he filed a statement duly signed and notarized stating that he contested the general elections as a candidate of the political party specified therein.\"\n\nApparently, the provisos have carefully been drafted to specifically negate what the majority judgment of the Supreme Court stated. In section 104, a similar expression has been added, which is followed by the proviso making a political party ineligible for the quota of reserved seats at a later stage.\n\n\"Provided further that if any political party fails to submit its list for reserved seats within the aforesaid prescribed time period, it shall not be eligible for the quota in the reserved seats at later stage,\" the proviso reads.\n\nSubsequently, the bill seeks insertion of a new section 104-A (consent for joining of political party by independent returned candidate to be irrevocable) in the act.\n\nThe new proposed section states: \"Notwithstanding anything contained in this or any other law for the time being in force or a judgment, decree or order of any court including the Supreme Court of Pakistan and a High Court, the consent of an independent returned candidate once given for joining a political party for purposes of clause (6) of Article 51 or clause (3) of Article 106 shall be irrevocable.\"\n\nIn the statement of Objects and Reasons, Kayani stated that Articles 51 and 106 of the Constitution provided for allocation of seats to the national and provincial assemblies, respectively, along with mechanism for the elections thereto and include that the independent returned candidate or candidates may duly join a political party within three days of the publication in the official Gazette of the names of the returned candidates.\n\nKayani maintained that the Elections Act, 2017, and rules made thereunder also provided for the right to independent returned candidate or candidates to duly join a political party at his consent.\n\n\"Neither the Constitution nor the Elections Act, 2017 provide for joining a political party by an independent returned candidate or candidates at subsequent stage when they have already exercised the option to join the political party at a point of time as specified in the Constitution,\" he added.\n\nTo provide clarity in the law in true spirit of the Constitution, he stated, the bill had been designed to expressly provide for that no independent candidate or candidates would exercise his/their right to join a political party at a subsequent stage after the period specified for the purpose in the Constitution and the law.\n\nAfter it was tabled, the law minister recommended the bill be referred to the standing committee concerned, which Speaker Ayaz Sadiq subsequently did, directing the committee chairman to convene a meeting the following day.\n\nAdditionally, the Pakistan National Excellence Institute Bill 2024 was passed during the session. Amjad Ali Khan of the SIC presented a bill to criminalise enforced disappearances, which was also referred to the standing committee concerned.\n\nFurther, the West Pakistan Maintenance of Public Order Amendment Bill was presented by Sahibzada Sibghatullah and referred to the relevant committee by the speaker. Pakistan Peoples Party's (PPP) member Agha Rafiullah introduced the Federal Employees Benevolent Fund and Group Insurance Amendment Bill 2024, which was also sent to the standing committee.\n\nAmjad Ali Khan introduced a constitutional amendment bill to add Article 9A, which was referred to the relevant standing committee as well.\n\nMeanwhile, the assembly debated a recent judgment of the Supreme Court pertaining to Khatam-e-Nabuwwat. Several lawmakers criticised the recent judgment in their hard-hitting speeches and urged the speaker to make a committee to examine the issue in detail and respond respectively.\n\nThe law minister, however, urged the lawmakers that the wise thing to do would be to first read the judgment first and then make any comment on it. The matter was also referred to a committee.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rizwan_shehzad@tribune.com.pk", "name":

It said that an independent candidates may join a political party within three days of the publication in the official Gazette of the names of returned candidates.\n\nThe bill said that no independent candidate can join a political party at a subsequent stage after the period specified for the purpose in the Constitution and the law.\n\nAfter the bill was tabled, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar proposed to refer it to a house committee for input from political parties. National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq sent the bill to the standing committee concerned. Several other bills including the Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2024 (Article-9A), the Federal Employees Benevolent Fund and Group Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2024, the Pakistan Examination Board Bill 2024, the Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2024 (Article27) and the West Pakistan Maintenance of Public Order (Repeal) Bill 2024 were also introduced. The House also passed the National Excellence Institute Bill 2024.Meanwhile, the meeting of NA Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs has been summoned today (Wednesday) to take up the Elections (Second Amendment) Bill 2024 for consideration. The meeting would be chaired by Iradat Sharif Khan.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking to the media outside the Parliament House, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the government was planning to introduce a legislation aimed at preventing his party from getting seats reserved for women and minorities. He said that the verdict of Supreme Court must be implemented and added it is hoped that the Supreme Court would get its decision concerning the PTI lawmakers implemented.\n\nGohar maintained 41 MNAs submitted affidavits, but despite that \"action is being taken against our MNAs\". He insisted that the Election Commission of Pakistan should issue the notification for the remaining legislators. \"We request the Supreme Court to provide protection to our members,\" he contended.\n\nPTI senior leader Latif Khosa said that a 'malicious bill' was being brought for lawmakers to change the party. He said that the NA Standing Committee on Law and Justice will not allow the bill to be passed. He made it clear that it was mandatory for every organisation to accept the decision of Supreme Court and ensure its implementation.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title":

It said they also detailed the treatment for independent candidates that may join a political party within three days of the publication in the official Gazette of the names of the returned candidates.\n\n\"The Elections Act, 2017 and rules made thereunder also provide for the right to independent returned candidate or candidates to duly join a political party at his consent. Neither the Constitution nor the Elections Act, 2017 provide for joining a political party by an independent returned candidate or candidates at subsequent stage when they have already exercised the option to join the political party at a point of time as specified in the Constitution.\n\n\"To provide clarity in the law in true spirit of the Constitution, this bill has been designed to expressly provide for that no independent candidate or candidates shall exercise his/their right to join a political party at a subsequent stage after the period specified for the purpose in the Constitution and the law,\" the statement reasoned.\n\nThe bill said that a candidate would be considered an independent instead of a party candidate if they did not file a declaration with the returning officer before the allotment of the election symbol showing their affiliation with a political party through a certificate from the party confirming the same.\n\n\"An independent candidate shall not be considered as the candidate of any political party if at later stage he files a statement duly signed and notarised stating that he contested the general elections as a candidate of the political party specified therein.\" Another change proposed by the bill said that if any political party failed to submit its list for reserved seats within the prescribed period then it would not be eligible for the quota of reserved seats at a later time.\n\nThe change proposed said: \"Consent for joining of political party by independent returned candidate to be irrevocable. Notwithstanding anything contained in this act or any other law for the time being in force or a judgment, decree or order of any court, including the Supreme Court of Pakistan and a high court, the consent of an independent returned candidate once given for joining a political party for purposes of clause (6) of Article 51 or clause (3) of Article 106 shall be irrevocable.\"\n\nImmediately after the bill was tabled, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar suggested it would be appropriate if the bill was referred to a committee for input from all political parties. National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq subsequently put the motion to a vote and granted leave to introduce the bill.

Legal experts say these amendments will likely also end up in court, though there is divided opinion on whether the amendments have a retrospective effect or are retroactive in nature.\n\nOn Tuesday, the PML-N introduced the Election Act (Amendment) Bill, 2024, in the National Assembly. Proposed by MNA Bilal Azhar Kiyani, the bill seeks to restrict independent lawmakers from joining political parties after a specified time period. The proposed law would amend Sections 66 and 104 of the Election Act, 2017, ensuring candidates remain independent if they have not declared party affiliation before receiving an election symbol. Additionally, the bill states that if a political party fails to submit its list for reserved seats within the prescribed period, it will lose eligibility for those seats.\n\nSpeaking to The News on Tuesday evening, PILDAT President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob says that it is \"quite obvious\" the proposed amendment intends to nullify the effect of the Supreme Court's July 12 verdict \"which facilitated the recognition of those independent MNAs as PTI MNAs who had not declared their affiliation with the PTI while filing nomination papers. The bill is also meant to block the way for those MNAs to join the PTI who were elected as independent but later joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC)\".\n\nHow would that work? To understand the legal nuances, The News contacted lawyers for clarity. According to Supreme Court advocate Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar, the proposed amendments would have \"a legal impact on the ongoing controversy surrounding reserved seats for women and minorities.\"\n\nInterestingly, in Khokhar's opinion, \"the proposed electoral amendments would take effect immediately and be deemed to have effect from the promulgation of Election Act 2017, which means that these changes will also be effective retroactively from the day of the promulgation of Election Act, 2017 and will supersede the effect of any court rulings pertaining to the aforementioned clauses\".\n\nThis is not the only opinion, however. For Barrister Ali Tahir, while the proposed amendments \"directly attempt to overrule the Supreme Court's short order in the reserved seats case, the government has jumped the gun and opened a can of worms for itself.\"\n\nHe explains: \"The wording of the bill -- even though it is camouflaged by referring to other provisions, laws and high courts -- includes orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The word 'notwithstanding' has very recently been interpreted by the courts to mean that a provision containing the notwithstanding provision will prevail over other provisions, and here 'notwithstanding' has also been used for orders of the Supreme Court -- thereby attempting to overrule the announced short order. It attempts to roll back the entire process ordered to be initiated by stating that candidates cannot join the PTI\".\n\nThe bill if turned into law will fail for two reasons, pronounces Barrister Tahir. First, he disagrees with Khokhar's assessment and says that \"such laws cannot have retrospective effect\". Second, he adds, though the SC's reserved seats \"detailed reasons are yet to be delivered, I am sure in those detailed reasons, constitutional interpretation will be the backbone for the directions contained in the short order, especially with regard to constitutional provisions relating to democracy and the fundamental right for political participation\". This is why the bill would likely fail if it became law, says the barrister.\n\nRegarding the July 12 verdict, PILDAT's Ahmed Bilal Mehboob points out that the Supreme Court \"arguably rewrote some provisions of the constitution and the Elections Act, 2017 and some may interpret this as trespassing into the domain of parliament\". In some way then, says Mehboob, the proposed amendment may be seen as \"parliament defending its turf\". It \"squarely pits parliament against the top judiciary, and it remains to be seen who blinks first\".\n\nMehboob also feels that -- on another level -- this can also be seen as \"yet another episode of the ongoing fight between the PTI on the one hand and the PMLN-PPP combine apparently supported by the establishment on the other.\" He too says the amendment has a retrospective effect and \"quite pointedly tends to overrule the Supreme Court order\".\n\nBarrister Tahir, while disagreeing on the amendment having any such retrospective effect, does say that \"for the time being and especially with regard to the time-specific directions, the ECP may delay implementation of the SC order pointing to the amended laws in vogue if the bill ultimately is passed by parliament\".\n\nThe News also asked the legal commentators if these amendments could potentially help clear the reserved seats issue or will they just end up complicating an already messy affair, and whether there was this need for the law to be further tweaked and clarified. Barrister Tahir thinks that the issue will be prolonged temporarily since \"the ECP may delay implementation seeking the Supreme Court's guidance once the bill makes it to the statute book\". Eventually, though, he feels the law will not succeed.\n\nOn the reserved seats issue, while he says we should wait for the detailed order of the SC, Tahir does feel that there was \"definitely a lot of room for interpretation as the constitutional and statutory provisions did not provide for a cut-out specific answer to the problem, and thus the reasons will have to fall back on larger constitutional values\".\n\nThough Hafiz Ahsaan acknowledges that Articles 51 and 106 of the constitution, in conjunction with Section 104 of the Election Act 2017 and Rules 92 and 94 of the Election Rules 2017, provide a comprehensive mechanism for determining the political parties or independent returned candidates' eligibility, qualification, declaration, and allocation of reserved seats, he says that \"there was a need in the Election Act to have more clarity and explanation to avoid any legal confusion on the matter\".\n\nThe eventual destination of these amendments, says Khokhar, will be the courts. Why? Because although \"the legal competence of parliament to enact laws, either prospectively or retrospectively is unquestionable, because of the ongoing dispute between political parties over the distribution of reserved seats, these amendments if passed by parliament will end up for their final fate in court\".\n\nKhokhar reiterates that, if parliament approves, these amendments \"will become enforceable and obligatory on all state institutions, superseding court rulings on the matter, until they are challenged or declared otherwise by the constitutional courts\".", "source": {"uri":

He was responding to a point raised by Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) chief Hamid Raza, who said that according to the Punjab Quran Board Act, a non-Muslim could not publish copies of the Holy Quran. He claimed the Supreme Court first accepted the bail plea of an accused and then acquitted him.\n\nThe law minister, however, said the court verdict could be discussed at an appropriate parliamentary forum for future action, adding that the Supreme Court of Pakistan could interpret the Constitution, but not rewrite it. He said that it was the responsibility of the state to respond to the SC verdict.\n\n\"After consultation, it will be decided whether the state should file a review petition or a resolution is passed by the house,\" the minister said, proposing the verdict be examined by the business advisory committee of the lower house or National Assembly Standing Committee on Law and Justice.\n\n\"We can pass a resolution on this issue after three or four days on the basis of whatever decision is taken by the house,\" he said, asserting that no individual could be permitted to issue a fatwa against others. He said it could not be tolerated that an individual incited violence against personalities, like the CJP.\n\nEarlier, the SIC chief claimed that the top court attempted to re-write the Constitution and demanded a committee of the National Assembly over the decision. \"Those who committed this action should be brought to justice,\" he said. PML-N leader Hanif Abbasi said there were no two opinions on the dignity of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), but stressed that \"factories of decrees\" could not be allowed.\n\nMr Abbasi called for the formation of a parliamentary committee to take up the issue. PTI lawmaker Ali Muhammad Khan said the decision of the Supreme Court had created an ambiguity.\n\nReferring to the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Abdul Qadir Patel said nobody has the right to issue such verdicts. He alleged that fitna (discord) was being spread in the name of human rights from the Western world. He said a committee should be formed to see what punishment should be given to those who created such a situation.\n\nJUI-F leader Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri said that the issue of the finality of Prophethood (PBUH) had been decided once and for all. \"I want to ask the Supreme Court how it went for re-writing the Constitution.\"\n\nBut the law minister pointed out that parliament, as the legislative body, could change the verdict of the judiciary through legislation.", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawn"}, "authors": [{"uri": "iftikhar_a_khan@dawn.com", "name": "Iftikhar A.

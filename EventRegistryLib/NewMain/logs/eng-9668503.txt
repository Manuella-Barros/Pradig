Walter Leo Jackson, a serial rapist who died in prison, is the double murder suspect, the FBI said Thursday\n\nNearly three decades after the murders of two women in Virginia's Shenandoah National Park, the FBI says they now know who was responsible for the horrific crime.\n\nJulie Williams and Lollie Winans were murdered at their campsite near Skyland Resort in May 1996. Winans was 26 and Williams was 24.\n\nA fellow hiker and convicted serial rapist killed them, the FBI said Thursday, after new DNA testing.\n\nWalter Leo Jackson, originally from Cleveland, is the suspect in the double murder, members of the FBI's Richmond Field Office said at a news conference. Jackson died in prison in 2018 after a criminal history that included rapes, assaults and kidnappings, the FBI said.\n\nWilliams' father, Tom Williams, told News4 that FBI representatives flew to his family's home in Minnesota to share the news about the suspect in person. He said it's \"immaterial\" to him that his daughter's suspected killer is now dead.\n\n\"Knowing that it's truly the right person involved in the killings and other assaults, that he's the right person, is good. It would not serve me or anybody having to sit through [a trial], legally saying 'This is the person' and putting him away,\" he said.\n\nU.S. Attorney Christopher Kavanaugh said he hopes the news can bring the families some closure.\n\n\"After 28 years, we are now able to say who committed the brutal murders of Lollie Winans and Julie Williams in Shenandoah National Park,\" he said. \"I want to again extend my condolences to the Winans and Williams families and hope today's announcement provides some small measure of solace.\"\n\nA place of tranquility and beauty was transformed into a scene of horror.\n\nWilliams and Winans, a couple, began hiking in Shenandoah National Park on May 19. They were due to return to their summer jobs in Vermont on May 28. But no one had heard from them.\n\nWilliams' father reported them missing on May 31 and their bodies were found the next day. They had been bound and their throats were slashed.\n\nThe last photo in their camera had been taken a few days earlier, as they happily hiked and camped.\n\nAn accredited private lab recently pulled DNA from several items of evidence and submitted the data to the federal DNA index system, the FBI said. They found a positive match for Jackson.\n\nJackson went by Leo and was a residential painter and avid hiker who often visited Shenandoah National Park, the FBI said. He was known to use temporary tags and alter the license plates of vehicles, which he frequently swapped out.\n\nIn 2002, the FBI named a suspect in the killings after he was found guilty of attacking a woman in the park in 1997. Charges against him in the murder case were dropped after DNA failed to link him to the crime.\n\nU.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft said in 2002 that because Winans and Williams were lesbians, the case would be handled as a potential hate crime.\n\nInvestigators repeatedly said they never gave up on trying to solve the case.\n\n\"These were two young women in the prime of their lives, Julie Williams and Lollie Winans, and we owe it to them and to their families not to rest and we won't until justice is served,\" John Fishwick, then-U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, said in 2016.\n\nAnyone with potentially relevant information is asked to contact the FBI.", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6 South Florida"}, "authors": [],

Welcome to WatchMojo, and today we're counting down our picks for cold cases that remained unsolved for years until DNA breakthroughs yielded unexpected revelations.\n\nLaw enforcement officials on Thursday morning announced a major breakthrough in the nearly 30-year-old double homicide that became known as the Shenandoah Park Murders.\n\nFBI Richmond's Central Virginia Task Force identified Walter \"Leo\" Jackson Sr., of Cleveland, Ohio, as the killer in the 1996 double murder of Julianne Williams, 24, of St. Cloud, Minn., and Laura \"Lollie\" Winans, 26, of Unity, Maine.\n\n\"We are proud to stand here and tell you we now know who is responsible for this infamous crime,\" FBI Richmond's Special Agent in Charge Stanley Meador said.\n\nJackson, who died in prison in March 2018 in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, was a convicted serial rapist.\n\nWilliams and Winans were camping in Shenandoah National Park with their golden retriever Taj in May 1996.\n\nDays later, on June 1, the two women's bodies were discovered at their creekside campsite a half mile from Skyland Drive off of the Appalachian Trail - one inside their tent and the other nearby outside.\n\nThey were found naked, bound and gagged, and their throats had been cut. The dog was later found wandering the park alone, which prompted the search for the couple.\n\nThe FBI and National Parks Service received thousands of tips in the months and years following the murders and considered numerous motives including a potential hate crime.\n\nThey identified numerous suspects including Darrell David Rice, a Maryland resident, who was convicted of an attempted abduction of a woman in Shenandoah Park.\n\nIn April 2002, Rice was indicted on capital murder charges in connection to the park killings; however, the charges were eventually dropped due to a lack of

Winans, originally from Grosse Pointe, Michigan, was studying outdoor recreation at Unity College, and would have graduated that December.

Family members called the National Park Service when the women didn't return home.\n\nThe pair began hiking in Shenandoah National Park on May 19. They were due to return to their summer jobs in Vermont on May 28. But no one had heard from them, according to media reports at the time.\n\nTheir bodies were found on June 1, 1996, during a search by park rangers. They had been bound, and their throats had been slashed.\n\n\"Their murder sparked shock and fear throughout the community and nation,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Stanley Meador. \"We now know who is responsible for this heinous crime.\"\n\nJackson died in a prison in Cuyahoga County, Ohio in March 2018. His criminal history includes kidnapping, rapes and assaults, the FBI said. He was forensically linked to two rapes that occurred in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, in June and July 1996, just weeks after Winans and Williams were killed, Kavanaugh said.\n\nSUSPECTED LONG ISLAND SERIAL KILLER'S NOTES OUTLINED METICULOUS MURDER PLOT: COURT DOCS\n\nJackson was a painter by trade and was an \"avid\" hiker who was known to visit Shenandoah National Park.\n\nIn 2004, another man, Darrell D. Rice, was indicted for the killings but the charges were dropped just before his trial after his DNA failed to link him to the crime. The Virginia FBI took a new look at the case in 2021, Meador said.\n\nWith funding from the Department of Justice's sexual-assault-kit initiative, investigators combed through everything in the case file, re-examining evidence, photos and interviews. Considering advancements in DNA technology, the team spent \"countless hours\" determining what pieces of evidence could be retested, Meador said.\n\nA lab pulled DNA from the evidence and submitted the result to the federal DNA index system, the FBI said. They found a positive match to Jackson, whose DNA was on file in Cuyahoga County. Additionally, investigators compared evidence from the murders directly to a buccal swab containing Jackson's DNA.\n\nGILGO BEACH SERIAL KILLER SUSPECT ALLEGEDLY HAS MORE VICTIMS, HUNTING GROUNDS THAN POLICE FIRST IMAGINED\n\n\"Those results confirmed we had the right man and finally could tell the victim's families we know who is responsible for this heinous crime,\" Meador said.\n\n\"There was a one-out-of-2.6-trillion chance that it originated from someone other than Walter Leo Jackson,\" Kavanaugh said. \"I've prosecuted many homicides and cold cases, and I have never witnessed statistics that high.\"\n\nFederal investigators said Jackson was likely driving a 1984 Chestnut Brown AMC Eagle 30 at the time of the murders, though he was known to use temporary tags, alter license plates and frequently change vehicles.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe FBI is working to determine whether Jackson was responsible for other unsolved crimes.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com",

(AP) -- Nearly three decades after two young women were found with their throats slashed in Virginia's Shenandoah National Park, federal authorities announced Thursday that they have identified a convicted serial rapist from Ohio as the person they believe was responsible for the killings.\n\nThe bodies of Julianne \"Julie\" Williams, 24, and her partner, Laura \"Lollie\" Winans, 26, were found bound and gagged at their campsite in the park in 1996. The killings sent a wave of fear through the LGBTQ+ community, but the FBI said during a news conference Thursday that there is no evidence that the women were targeted because of their sexual orientation.\n\nThe long-unsolved killings were reviewed by a new investigative team starting in 2021, said Stanley Meador, the Special Agent in Charge of the Richmond FBI office. Recently, a private lab pulled DNA from several pieces of evidence from the crime scene and sent the genetic profile to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, a database used by law enforcement agencies to match DNA to a criminal suspect.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Meador said the FBI then got DNA from the original swab taken from Jackson when he was charged in another rape in Ohio, which confirmed the match. He said the recent DNA testing found there is only a one in 2.6 trillion chance that the DNA found at the crime scene came from someone other than Jackson.\n\nThis week, FBI officials were able to tell the families of the two women who they believe committed the killings, Meador said.\n\n\"They've been seeking answers far too long.\" Meador said.\n\nJackson, who worked as a house painter, died in prison in 2018 in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, at age 70. He had served at least four separate prison terms after being convicted of kidnapping and multiple rapes and assaults.\n\nThe recent retesting of crime scene evidence showed that both Williams and Winans were sexually assaulted, said Christopher Kavanaugh, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia. Kavanaugh said authorities investigated whether the rapes and killings could be considered hate crimes. But he said they found no evidence that Jackson knew of their sexual orientation or targeted them for that reason.\n\n\"Make no mistake, this crime was brutal, this crime was definitely hateful, nevertheless we do not have any evidence\" that the crime was motivated by anti-gay bias, Kavanaugh said.\n\nAuthorities were vague when asked whether the same DNA testing could have been done years ago and identified the suspect earlier.\n\nIn 2001, authorities arrested another man in the killings. Darrell David Rice, a computer programmer from Maryland, was charged with capital murder, and authorities alleged that he selected Williams and Winans because of his hatred of women and gay people.\n\nRice had pleaded guilty in 1998 in the attempted abduction of a female bicyclist he tried to force into his truck, also in Shenandoah National Park. He was serving an 11-year prison sentence when he was charged with killing WIlliams and Winans. The charges were eventually dropped after forensic testing showed that hairs found at the crime scene ruled him out as a possible suspect.\n\nWilliams, who was from St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Winans, who grew up in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, were both experienced hikers and were passionate about environmental issues, Kavanaugh said. They were hiking with a golden retriever named Taj when they were last seen by park personnel on May 24, 1996. Their bodies were discovered on June 1, 1996, at their campsite near Skyline Resort.\n\nMeador said the FBI is continuing to work with other law enforcement agencies to determine if Jackson is responsible for other unsolved crimes.\n\n\"Our investigation will not stop,\" he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Nearly three decades after two young women were found with their throats slashed in Virginia's Shenandoah National Park, federal authorities announced Thursday that they have identified a convicted serial rapist from Ohio as the person they believe was responsible for the killings.\n\nThe bodies of Julianne \"Julie\" Williams, 24, and her partner, Laura \"Lollie\" Winans, 26, were found bound and gagged at their campsite in the park in 1996. The killings sent a wave of fear through the LGBTQ+ community, but the FBI said during a news conference Thursday that there is no evidence that the women were targeted because of their sexual orientation.\n\nThe long-unsolved killings were reviewed by a new investigative team starting in 2021, said Stanley Meador, the Special Agent in Charge of the Richmond FBI office. Recently, a private lab pulled DNA from several pieces of evidence from the crime scene and sent the genetic profile to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, a database used by law enforcement agencies to match DNA to a criminal suspect.\n\nThey got a positive match to Walter \"Leo\" Jackson Sr., a convicted rapist originally from the Cleveland, Ohio, area. Meador said the FBI then got DNA from the original swab taken from Jackson when he was charged in another rape in Ohio, which confirmed the match. He said the recent DNA testing found there is only a one in 2.6 trillion chance that the DNA found at the crime scene came from someone other than Jackson.\n\nThis week, FBI officials were able to tell the families of the two women who they believe committed the killings, Meador said.\n\n\"They've been seeking answers far too long.\" Meador said.\n\nJackson, who worked as a house painter, died in prison in 2018 in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, at age 70. He had served at least four separate prison terms after being convicted of kidnapping and multiple rapes and assaults.\n\nThe recent retesting of crime scene evidence showed that both Williams and Winans were sexually assaulted, said Christopher Kavanaugh, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia. Kavanaugh said authorities investigated whether the rapes and killings could be considered hate crimes. But he said they found no evidence that Jackson knew of their sexual orientation or targeted them for that reason.\n\n\"Make no mistake, this crime was brutal, this crime was definitely hateful, nevertheless we do not have any evidence\" that the crime was motivated by anti-gay bias, Kavanaugh said.\n\nAuthorities were vague when asked whether the same DNA testing could have been done years ago and identified the suspect earlier.\n\nIn 2001, authorities arrested another man in the killings. Darrell David Rice, a computer programmer from Maryland, was charged with capital murder, and authorities alleged that he selected Williams and Winans because of his hatred of women and gay people.\n\nRice had pleaded guilty in 1998 in the attempted abduction of a female bicyclist he tried to force into his truck, also in Shenandoah National Park. He was serving an 11-year prison sentence when he was charged with killing WIlliams and Winans. The charges were eventually dropped after forensic testing showed that hairs found at the crime scene ruled him out as a possible suspect.\n\nWilliams, who was from St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Winans, who grew up in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, were both experienced hikers and were passionate about environmental issues, Kavanaugh said. They were hiking with a golden retriever named Taj when they were last seen by park personnel on May 24, 1996. Their bodies were discovered on June 1, 1996, at their campsite near Skyline Resort.\n\nMeador said the FBI is continuing to work with other law enforcement agencies to determine if Jackson is responsible for other unsolved crimes.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type":

(7News) -- Virginia and federal investigators for decades have worked to solve the murder of two friends in Shenandoah National Park in 1996, but they hope Thursday's announcement can give the families a bit of closure.\n\nThursday morning, Federal Bureau of Investigations officials in Richmond, Virginia told news outlets that they knew who committed the murders of Julianne \"Julie\" Williams and Laura \"Lollie\" Winans near the Skyland Resort just over 28 years ago.\n\nBut the suspect, Ohio man Walter Leo Jackson Sr., won't see a courtroom; he died in prison in March 2018.\n\nJackson, a painter by trade, had a lengthy criminal history of kidnapping, rapes, and assaults; he also had been incarcerated four times between 1984 and 2018, officials said.\n\nOfficials said recent DNA samples submitted to an FBI database matched with Jackson's, but other evidence also pointed to him.\n\nWilliams and Winans were reportedly murdered at their campsite on May 24, 1996, but they weren't found until days later on June 1 after family members contacted authorities. According to a report from WTVR at the time, the pair of friends were finishing up a hiking trip that stretched from New York to Shenandoah Valley.\n\n\"After 28 years, we are now able to say who committed the brutal murders of Lollie Winans and Julie Williams in Shenandoah National Park,\" United States Attorney Christopher R. Kavanaugh said in a statement. \"I want to again extend my condolences to the Winans and Williams families and hope today's announcement provides some small measure of solace.\"\n\nFederal agents said Jackson was likely driving a 1984 Chestnut Brown AMC Eagle 30 at the time of the murders, though he was known to use temporary tags, alter license plates, and frequently change vehicles.\n\nJackson was in jail in Cuyahoga County, Ohio from May 2012 until his death; but officials believe there could've been more victims.

The FBI described him as an avid hiker and frequenter of Shenandoah National Park.\n\nA federal grand jury previously indicted Darrell David Rice for the murders in 2002, alleging that he had a history of anti-gay sentiment and had targeted the women because they were in a romantic relationship. The case was dismissed when DNA evidence from the case showed no link to Rice.\n\nFBI Special Agent-in-Charge Stanley Meador told reporters that a new team of investigators had taken on the case in 2021. With funding from the Department of Justice's sexual-assault-kit initiative, the team submitted crime-scene evidence to a lab that was able to obtain DNA from the items, which Meador declined to describe.\n\nThe DNA sample matched almost exactly a sample Jackson had given during a prior arrest, and the findings indicated that both women had been sexually assaulted, Meador said.\n\n\"There was a one-out-of-2.6-trillion chance that it originated from someone other than Walter Leo Jackson,\" Kavanaugh said. \"I've prosecuted many homicides and cold cases and I have never witnessed statistics that high.\"\n\n(Reporting by Gabriella Borter;

Kavanaugh said authorities investigated whether the rapes and killings could be considered hate crimes. But he said they found no evidence that Jackson knew of their sexual orientation or targeted them for that reason.\n\n\"Make no mistake, this crime was brutal, this crime was definitely hateful, nevertheless we do not have any evidence\" that the crime was motivated by anti-gay bias, Kavanaugh said.\n\nAuthorities were vague when asked whether the same DNA testing could have been done years ago and identified the suspect earlier.\n\nIn 2001, authorities arrested another man in the killings. Darrell David Rice, a computer programmer from Maryland, was charged with capital murder, and authorities alleged that he selected Williams and Winans because of his hatred of women and gay people.\n\nRice had pleaded guilty in 1998 in the attempted abduction of a female bicyclist he tried to force into his truck, also in Shenandoah National Park. He was serving an 11-year prison sentence when he was charged with killing WIlliams and Winans. The charges were eventually dropped after forensic testing showed that hairs found at the crime scene ruled him out as a possible suspect.\n\nWilliams, who was from St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Winans, who grew up in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, were both experienced hikers and were passionate about environmental issues, Kavanaugh said. They were hiking with a golden retriever named Taj when they were last seen by park personnel on May 24, 1996.

Welcome to WatchMojo, and today we're counting down our picks for cold cases that remained unsolved for years until DNA breakthroughs yielded unexpected revelations.\n\nLaw enforcement officials on Thursday announced a major breakthrough in the nearly 30-year-old double homicide cold case that became known as the Shenandoah Park Murders.\n\nFBI Richmond's Central Virginia Task Force identified Walter \"Leo\" Jackson Sr., of Cleveland, Ohio, as the killer in the 1996 double murder of Julianne \"Julie\" Williams, 24, of St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Laura \"Lollie\" Winans, 26, of Unity, Maine.\n\nJackson, who died in a Cuyahoga County, Ohio, prison in March 2018 at the age of 71, was a convicted serial rapist connected to several other rapes, kidnappings and assaults.\n\nFollowing the creation of a new investigative team in 2021 tasked with reevaluating the case, the FBI definitively linked Jackson to Williams and Winans through DNA evidence.\n\n\"Those results confirmed that we had the right man and finally could tell the victim's families we know who is responsible for this heinous crime,\" said Stanley Meador, FBI Richmond special agent in charge, at a press conference announcing the discovery.\n\nJackson, who was a residential painter, was an avid hiker and known to frequent the Shenandoah National Park.\n\nWilliams and Winans were camping in the park with their golden retriever Taj in May 1996 before Williams, a geology major, was slated to begin a new job the following month.\n\nDays later, however, on June 1, the couple's bodies were discovered at their creekside campsite a half mile from Skyland Drive off of the Appalachian Trail -- one inside their tent and the other nearby outside.\n\nThey were found naked, bound and gagged and their throats had been cut. Their dog was later found wandering the park alone, which prompted the search for the couple.\n\nThe FBI and National Park Service received thousands of tips in the months and years following the murders and considered numerous motives including a potential hate crime.\n\nAuthorities identified numerous suspects, including Darrell David Rice, a Maryland resident, who was convicted of an attempted abduction of a woman in Shenandoah National Park.\n\nIn April 2002, Rice was indicted on capital murder charges in connection to the park killings; however, the charges were eventually dropped due to a lack of forensic evidence.\n\nPolice seek help to solve student's 1996 slaying\n\nU.S. Attorney Christopher Kavanaugh said law enforcement would have to rely on forensic evidence to solve this case, which is ultimately how they ruled out Rice as a suspect.\n\nNow, they are working to determine if Jackson is connected to other unsolved cases. Due to Jackson's extensive criminal history, they have ruled him out of several cases in the area, including the murders of Cathleen Thomas and Rebecca Dowski, whose 1986 murders were the first in connection to the Colonial Parkway Murders.\n\nAdditionally, Kavanaugh said, while the murders were brutal, they do not believe the couple was targeted as a hate crime.\n\nWilliams was a state champion tennis player who had graduated in 1994 from Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. She had dreams of becoming a geologist. Winans was set to graduate from Unity College with a degree in outdoor leadership.\n\nThe pair, who had been dating for nearly two years, were both outdoors enthusiasts. They had met at an outdoor program named \"Woodswomen.\"\n\n\"After 28 years, we are now able to say who committed the brutal murders,\" Kavanaugh said. \"I want to again extend my condolences to the Winans and Williams families and hope today's announcement provides some small measure of solace.\"\n\nPolice: Colonial Parkway double murder, another Hampton cold case solved\n\nFBI seeks information

Hey, it\u2019s summer, or almost summer, and content is where you find it. Or create it, and what better content than rankings? For this one, let\u2019s start with a very large man who entered the league three years ago and told reporters \u201cI like (expletive) people up,\u201d and who got me thinking recently about recent Lions drafts. Levi Onwuzurike said that the night the Lions drafted him in 2021, talking to a group of reporters on a video conference call. Aaron Glenn chuckled when told what his new defensive lineman had said. The Lions defensive coordinator then followed with this: ON THE LINE: Alim McNeill next in line for extension, sees 'destruction' on Detroit Lions DL this fall He better back it up. That was the word the fourth-year tackle used last week during minicamp when he met with reporters just off the field. And if he finds redemption \u2014 even if he just finds regular, moderately productive minutes on the field, he\u2019ll finally be able to contribute to one of the best NFL draft classes in recent years. Onwuzurike was a second-round pick out of Washington, and Holmes' second pick as Lions general manager. For football reasons and for pride reasons, Holmes certainly wants to see the big fella find his way this upcoming season. If he doesn\u2019t, if he flames out or doesn\u2019t figure it out until he\u2019s with another team \u2014 his contract is up after next season \u2014 that won\u2019t dent the success of just about everyone else in his draft class. But it could keep the class from ranking among the NFL's all-time best, an honor it's approaching after just three seasons. Holmes selected seven players in that draft in Cleveland. Five of them are starters. Two of them have already earned All-Pro nods \u2014 one first-teamer, one second-teamer. Another one appears bound for the Pro Bowl. One \u2014 and maybe two \u2014 could make the Hall of Fame one day. That is a franchise-changing haul for a draft that didn\u2019t include a franchise quarterback (though you\u2019d be surprised how many of the all-time great classes don\u2019t include them, at least if we\u2019re grading on depth and longevity). The Lions' 2021 class began with offensive tackle Penei Sewell and ended with running back Jermar Jefferson. In between \u2014 and in order \u2014 Holmes drafted Onwuzurike, defensive tackle Alim McNeill, defensive back Ifeatu Melinfonwu, wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and linebacker Derrick Barnes. CARLOS MONARREZ: If Detroit Lions want 'the whole enchilada,' they'll have to master all the side dishes A solid draft is finding two starters and two rotation players. A great draft is finding four starters. Holmes found FIVE with this one. But they're not just starters. Holmes found difference makers in Sewell, St. Brown and McNeill. Melinfonwu is still showing what he might become. And Barnes helped the linebacking crew last season, most notably with a game-clinching interception to send the Lions to the NFC championship game. Sewell, the No. 7 overall pick, might end up being the best player in the entire draft. St. Brown went in the fourth round; if he keeps stacking up seasons like the one he just had, he'll be headed to Canton and a gold jacket at the end of his career. McNeill isn\u2019t at that level, but the Lions believe he has a level beyond the one he showed last season \u2014 and last season showed he is very, very good. Then again, the class of 2023 may end up pushing 2021's group a few years from now. Already, 2023 has delivered a second-team All-Pro, and two others with All-Pro potential. Yes, All-Pro, not Pro Bowl. That\u2019s how promising Jahmyr Gibbs and Brian Branch looked last season at their respective positions: running back and nickel back/safety. Meanwhile, Sam LaPorta, Holmes' first second-round pick \u2014 Branch was the other \u2014 made second-team All-Pro at tight end. That\u2019s three high-level starters. But wait, the class produced a fourth starter, too: Jack Campbell. And while he may not be as immediately successful as Branch, Gibbs and LaPorta, he made a few plays last season, got better at the end of the season, and played arguably the toughest position of the four: middle linebacker. None of the four are likely to be as good as Sewell is at his position, though it\u2019s possible with LaPorta, who set the NFL record for receptions by a rookie TE. Of course, St. Brown set the NFL record for receptions through a player's first two seasons, and just fell short of the three-season mark. For that reason, the 2021 class has the lead for now. But it\u2019s early, and Day 2-3 picks Hendon Hooker, Brodric Martin, Colby Sorsdal and Antoine Green still have a chance to be rotational pieces or starters. If that were to happen, then the 2023 class leapfrogs the 2021 class. Rare is the class that hits on every prospect. New Orleans did in 2017 \u2014 a class, by the way, that included Alex Anzalone; yes, the Lions' Alex Anzalone \u2014 when they found seven players that either start or play meaningful minutes. The Saints\u2019 2017 class is considered among the best in the league by NFL draft analysts over the last 20 years. New Orleans drafted three players who made three Pro Bowls and one player who made All-Pro that year. The Lions' 2023 class might rival it eventually. The Lions' 2022 class will not, though. This class ranks third among Holmes' first three classes. But 2022 isn't without contributors, either. Holmes took a gem at No. 2 overall in Aidan Hutchinson and found a good starting safety in Kerby Joseph in the second round at No. 97 overall. For a season, at least, James Houston looked like a revelation from the sixth round, and sixth-round linebacker Malcolm Rodriguez became a fan favorite thanks to some exposure on HBO's \"Hard Knocks.\" Now, if wide receiver Jameson Williams and defensive end Josh Paschal become more than what they\u2019ve been the last two seasons, then the reconsidering will begin again. For the moment, though, the 2022 class, while productive, takes a back seat to the 2021 and 2023 classes. And if Onwuzurike hits this season? Well, 2021 will be even harder to catch. If he doesn\u2019t, the class will still go down as one of the Lions' best. Contact Shawn Windsor: 313-222-6487 or swindsor@freepress.com.

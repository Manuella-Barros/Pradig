Mnuchin, second from left, stands next to President Trump at an event Aug. 15 in New York at which Trump commented on last week's violence in Charlottesville. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, who faced calls from his Yale University classmates to resign in the wake of President Trump's controversial comments about last weekend's violence in Charlottesville, defended the president Saturday and said he intends to stay in office.\n\n\"While I find it hard to believe I should have to defend myself on this, or the president, I feel compelled to let you know that the president in no way, shape or form believes that neo-Nazi and other hate groups who endorse violence are equivalent to groups that demonstrate in peaceful and lawful ways,\" Mnuchin, who is Jewish, said in a statement released by the Treasury Department.\n\n[After Charlottesville, Republicans remain stymied over what to do about Trump]\n\nHis comments followed assertions by Trump last week that there was blame on \"both sides\" at the Charlottesville gathering organized by white supremacist groups that turned deadly and that some \"fine people\" participated in a march to protest the removal of a Confederate statue.\n\nMnuchin was among the Trump administration officials standing by Trump's side as he made those comments at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday at an event advertised to focus on Trump's plans to spur new investments in the nation's infrastructure.\n\nA letter signed by about 300 members of the Yale class of 1985 argued that it was Mnuchin's \"moral obligation\" to resign because Trump had \"declared himself a sympathizer with groups whose values are antithetical to those values we consider fundamental to our sacred honor as Americans.\"\n\n\"We know you are better than this, and we are counting on you to do the right thing,\" said the open letter circulated Friday.\n\nMnuchin referenced the views of his Yale classmates and others in his defense of Trump on Saturday and said that \"as someone who is Jewish, I believe I understand the long history of violence and hatred against the Jews (and other minorities) and circumstances that give rise to these sentiments and actions.\"\n\nBut Mnuchin argued that Trump's comments were misrepresented and pointed to an earlier statement in which he urged Americans to \"condemn all that hate stands for.\"\n\n\"Our President deserves the opportunity to propose his agenda and to do so without the attempts by those who opposed him in the primaries, in the general election and beyond to distract the administration and the American people from these most important policy issues -- jobs, economic growth and national security,\" Mnuchin said.\n\n\"As long as I am Treasury Secretary I will do the best job I can for the American people and provide the best advice I can to the President,\" he added.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T00:43:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 106, "textStart": 99, "imp":

Trump said not all those marching with neo-Nazis and white nationalists were racists, and appeared to equally condemn what he called the \"alt-left\" movement for provoking the violence that left one counter-protester dead.\n\n\"As someone who is Jewish, I believe I understand the long history of violence and hatred against the Jews (and other minorities) and circumstances that give rise to these sentiments and actions,\" Mnuchin wrote in his response.\n\n\"While I find it hard to believe I should have to defend myself on this, or the president, I feel compelled to let you know that the president in no way, shape or form, believes that neo-Nazi and other hate groups who endorse violence are equivalent to groups that demonstrate in peaceful and lawful ways.\"\n\nBut Mnuchin also suggested that the cultural forces giving rise to the so-called \"alt-right\" movement \"are far more complicated than we are led to believe by the mass media.\"\n\n\"If it were so simple, such actions would have been taken by other presidents, governors, and mayors, long before President Trump was elected by the American people,\" he wrote.\n\nMnuchin, 54, was an early supporter of the Trump campaign after a career as an investment banker, hedge fund manager and movie producer.

beings.\"\n\n\"President Trump made those declarations loudly, clearly, and unequivocally, and he said them as you stood next to him,\" it said.\n\nThe signatories told Mnuchin that Trump's reaction

Yale's newspaper, Yale Daily News, also shared the letter through its website.\n\nThe letter began, \"We believe it is your moral obligation to resign your post as Secretary of the Treasury, effective immediately.\"\n\n\"We understand that graduates of Yale College have served the United States proudly as presidents, members of the cabinet, and in many other capacities since its founding,\" the letter read. \"That rarely, if ever, have any of us made such a request of a classmate, whatever our differences in political opinion have been.\"\n\nThe Yale alums claimed that they wanted to publicly address the letter to Mnuchin because Trump sympathized with the far-right advocates, which are unethical values that they consider don't fall in line with the \"fundamental\" values of human decency.\n\n\"President Trump made those declarations loudly, clearly, and unequivocally, and he said them as you stood next to him,\" the letter added.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Mnuchin, who is Jewish, appeared to look uncomfortable as Trump \"exacerbated a controversy\" with remarks that sympathized with the Nazi's and white supremacists behavior in Charlottesville. The far-right protesters primarily chanted anti-Semitic comments alongside other racist chants directed at African Americans at the rally. Trump referred to the far-right as \"very fine people\" before calling out the far-left for its actions.\n\n\"We can be Republicans, Democrats, Libertarians, Greens, and a number of other things and still be friends, classmates, and patriots,\" the letter continued. \"We cannot be Nazis and white supremacists.\"\n\nThe letter added, \"We can disagree on the means of promoting the general welfare of the country, on the size and role of government, on the nature of freedom and security, but we cannot take the side of what we know to be evil.\"\n\nMnuchin's Yale classmates urged him to resign in an act of protest against Trump because of his bosses support of Nazism and white supremacy.\n\n\"We know you are better than this, and we are counting on you to do the right thing,\" the letter concluded.\n\nThe open letter comes on the heels of Tuesday's press briefing by Trump, who received scorn from both sides of the political aisle for directing equal condemnation at counter-protesters and the far-right. \"What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's comparison has led many members of his administration to sever tie with the administration. CEOs in Trump's business council and charitable organizations have parted ways with the president throughout the week. Steve Bannon, Trump's chief strategist, most notably left the administration Friday and returned to his post at right-wing publication Breitbart.\n\nSeveral counter-protests will be held nationwide as a follow-up to the events that transpired in Charlottesville. Boston, Dallas and New Orleans are holding \"Fight Supremacy\" protests, among other cities.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's (L) Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin (R), pictured April 21, 2017, receives letter from Yale classmates to resign from Trump's administration.

Sometimes you need protest in order to heal, & we will heal, & be stronger than ever before!\" the president said in a pair of tweets. \"I want to applaud the many protesters in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate. Our country will soon come together as one!\"\n\nAn hour before lauding Saturday's protesters, Trump, who's spending the weekend at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf resort, was less sympathetic. \"Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart!\" He praised the effort of law enforcement officers and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh.\n\nThe president has taken blistering criticism from lawmakers, business leaders and others over statements he made after violence at a protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left oner counterprotester dead. He cast similar blame on the neo-Nazis and white nationalists who organized the events and those who protested against it.\n\nSome of Trump's comments, criticizing \"alt-left\" protesters as \"very, very violent,\" came Aug. 15 with Mnuchin standing by the president's side in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. The raucous event had been expected to focus on the administration's infrastructure proposals.\n\nMnuchin, 54, was urged to quit his Treasury post in a letter from more than 300 fellow graduates of Yale University's Class of 1985, who said it was his \"moral obligation\" to step down in protest for Trump's \"support of Nazism and white supremacy.\"\n\nIn a statement late Saturday, Mnuchin, who is Jewish, said he understands \"the long history of violence and hatred against the Jews (and other minorities), and circumstances that give rise to these sentiments.\"\n\n\"I feel compelled to let you know that the president in no way, shape or form, believes that neo-Nazi and other hate groups who endorse violence are equivalent to groups that demonstrate in peaceful and lawful ways,\" the former banker and film producer said in the statement.\n\nWall Street was rattled last week by talk that another top Jewish member of the administration, economic adviser Gary Cohn, was upset by Trump's remarks and thinking about quitting. Cohn, who also flanked the president at the Trump Tower event, will remain in his position, a White House official said on Thursday.\n\nA week after the protests in Charlottesville turned deadly, an estimated 15,000 demonstrators, many chanting anti-Nazi slogans, descended on downtown Boston on Saturday, overwhelming a small group of conservatives gathered for a \"free speech rally.\"\n\nBoston's events were mostly peaceful, although late Saturday, the police tweeted that some protesters were throwing bottles, urine and rocks at them. The Boston Globe reported that about 20 arrests were made.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T22:02:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1587, "textStart": 1580, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb":

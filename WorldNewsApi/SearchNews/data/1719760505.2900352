Kelly Knipes, 42, began to notice she was sleepwalking regularly after the birth of her first child, Henry, in 2006. But the sleepwalking soon developed sleep shopping \u2013 a habit which has seen her splash \u00a33,000 while snoozing. Purchases including a full-sized plastic basketball court and hundreds of pounds worth of Haribo sweets. In March, Kelly received a spam text impersonating the government, offering financial assistance for her bills. While sleeping, she gave the scammers her financial information and has since been targeted several times after she suspects they sold on her information. The mum-of-three has ordered hundreds of pounds worth of Haribo (Picture: SWNS) Mum-of-three Kelly, who runs an events business, from Basildon, Essex, said: \u2018I\u2019ve had to cancel cards a few times, and I\u2019ve had lots of people try to take money out my bank. It can be anxiety-inducing. \u2018It\u2019s really upsetting and frustrating going to bed thinking \u201cI don\u2019t know what the night is going to lead to.\u201d\u2018 In 2018, Kelly was found to suffer from a condition called parasomnia, which she believes was sparked by her sleep apnea. The disorder forces her brain to partially wake and makes her do things while still asleep \u2013 such as browsing online shops. In 2010, long before being diagnosed, she woke up one day to the delivery of an \u2018in-ground basketball unit\u2019 including a net, pole and backboard, bought on eBay for \u00a3100. She also bought tins of paint, books about teaching, salt and pepper pots, a Wendy house, fridges and tables. She suffers from sleep apnoea (Picture: SWNS) She said by not being able to return a lot of the products, she racked up a debt of at least \u00a33,000 \u2013 although she has thankfully paid this off now. Kelly said: \u2018I couldn\u2019t refund any food purchases, like the Haribos. I kept the tins of paint, and the Wendy house because when that arrived and my kids saw it I felt I couldn\u2019t return it. \u2018I would never actually have to put any credit card details when when I was buying things online because it was all saved on my phone. I was racking up debt everywhere. \u2018I just think over the years, all the money just mounts.\u2019 But the disorder was more than just an online shopping habit \u2013 Kelly said she once took an overdose of diabetes medication when she was pregnant due to the disorder, in 2015, because she dreamt she was speaking to doctors. When she lived in a ground floor flat, she would wake to find doors and windows open after she\u2019d been up in the night. Kelly once bought a basketball court on eBay (Picture: SWNS) Her GP thought it was caused by the stress of having three disabled children \u2013 Henry, 18, who has epilepsy, Joey, nine, who is deaf and also has epilepsy, and Carson, eight, who has learning difficulties. But eventually a different doctor in 2018 found it was down to obstructive sleep apnea \u2013 which would cause her brain to partially wake. Her circumstances were improved significantly by wearing a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device to keep the airway open at night. But it hasn\u2019t been a miracle cure for Kelly \u2013 as the CPAP causes her jaw to lock and she unwittingly removes the machine from her face in her sleep. She can\u2019t take sleeping pills because she needs to be able to hear her children in the night in case they need help. Six years on from her diagnosis, poor Kelly is still finding herself plagued by her sleep habits.

Kelly said: \u2018I filled out a form after I got this text \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t have replied to it if I was awake. It was this scam that said I was owed \u00a3400 from the government to help with my bills. \u2018I gave them all my details, then when I woke up, they had taken \u00a3250 out my bank account.\u2019 Kelly managed to get the money back from the bank but reckons her personal information has been sold on by the scammers. There have been five further attempts made to withdraw different sums of money from her account, meaning she\u2019s had to cancel her card several times after. She added: \u2018Everyone thinks it\u2019s funny but it\u2019s not, some bits are, but some bits are quite serious. Giving out my details has had quite big consequences. \u2018But it\u2019s the least of my problems, in the grand scheme of things, I just focus on my children. It\u2019s just something that happens that I have to deal with.\u2019 Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

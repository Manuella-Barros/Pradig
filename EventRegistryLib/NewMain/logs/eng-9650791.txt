Never say the Washington Football Team wasn't a trend-setter.\n\nSome will call them clean, some will call them plain, some will call them the most boring jerseys in the NHL.\n\nThe Utah Hockey Club is currently in the process of having fans vote to determine the name the team will use for the long term. It entered its second round of voting last week, with six options available: the now-incumbent Utah Hockey Club, the Utah Blizzard, the Utah Mammoth, the Utah Outlaws, the Utah Venom and the Utah Yeti.\n\nWhichever name is selected will use the following colors, seen below with the Hockey Club's initial logos: rock black, salt white and mountain blue.\n\nObviously, some of the names will work better with those colors than others (can a woolly mammoth be blue). The second round of fan voting will run through June 20 until 11:59 p.m. MT.\n\nThe NHL's Board of Governors approved the $1.2 billion sale of the Coyotes to Smith in April, adding an NHL team to a personal sports empire that already included the NBA's Utah Jazz, MLS's Real Salt Lake, NWSL's Utah Royals, G League's Salt Lake City Stars, minor league baseball's Salt Lake Bees and MLS Next Pro's Real Monarchs.\n\nAs part of the sale agreement, if former Coyotes owner Alex Meruelo can secure a new arena in Arizona within five years, he can pay back the $1.2 billion and will be awarded an expansion franchise.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League",

doing it unbelievably well.\"\n\n\"We're excited about everything that Ryan and his organization are doing to welcome the players and welcome NHL hockey and introduce it into Utah,\" Bettman said June

It was chosen to complement the Jazz's \"Mountain Basketball\" purple. The hockey team is calling them mountain blue to represent the sky and the state's winter sports history, rock black for the darkness of night and volcanic rock in the deserts and salt white for snow and famous salt flats.\n\nThe home black and road white jerseys feature UTAH diagonally down from left to right. They are set to make their first practical in-person debut later this month at the upcoming NHL draft at the Sphere in Las Vegas when players selected by the team put them on.\n\nThe Utah Hockey Club will play in downtown Salt Lake City at Delta Center, a basketball arena that will need renovations in the coming years to increase the capacity of seats with an unobstructed view of the ice. Bettman at his pre-Stanley Cup Final news conference said that was a short-term issue that will be corrected, and he applauded the new owners by saying they are \"drinking from a firehose, and they're doing it unbelievably well.\"\n\n\"We're excited about everything that Ryan and his organization are doing to welcome the players and welcome NHL hockey and introduce it into Utah,\" Bettman said June 8 in Sunrise, Florida. \"I think things are going even better than we could have hoped based on the short timeframe that they've had to work with.\"", "source": {"uri": "wbal.com", "dataType": "news",

The franchise has also selected a color scheme of \"rock black,\" \"salt white,\" and \"mountain blue\" to serve as a base of its identity for both for this initial campaign in Salt Lake City and beyond. Those colors were chosen in part to be complementary to the existing look of the NBA's Jazz, also owned by Smith.\n\nUtah HC additionally released the first images of its new jerseys, which will be worn by the team's selections at the NHL draft set for June 28-29. Some initial Utah HC merchandise will go on sale to fans at that time, followed by wide rollouts as the regular season approaches.\n\nThese key steps to prepare for the 2024-25 season arrive as the franchise prepares a forthcoming third round of fan voting on the permanent team name. After starting with 20 options, the remaining choices include Yeti, Mammoth, Blizzard, Venom, Outlaws, and retaining the Utah HC identity. There is not a timetable to conclude the process, but that third round of voting will happen later this summer.\n\nBoth this interim identity and the permanent one are being developed with the aid of design firm Doubleday & Cartwright.

This dip coincides with the record date for the spinoff of its new Bitcoin Mini Trust. The sharp decline in GBTC's value marks a pivotal moment as investors react to the forthcoming transfer of a portion of GBTC's BTC holdings to the newly established trust.\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin ETF Plunged 11%\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance, the GBTC price slumped 11.42% to $52.87 in the trading session on Tuesday, July 30. This comes amid accelerated outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF as it recorded $54.3 million negative flow on Monday. Moreover, the negative sentiment has led to loss of investor confidence amid the Mini Trust distribution.\n\nJames Seyffart, a Bloomberg analyst, provided insight into the mechanics of the spinoff. He clarified that the 11% value decline in GBTC reflects the anticipated shift of assets into the Bitcoin Mini Trust. Seyffart emphasized the importance of the record date, which is today, and indicated that trading for BTC is expected to commence tomorrow, pending final approvals from the SEC.\n\n\"We are expecting $BTC to begin trading tomorrow. But there are still final 'approvals' from the SEC that are necessary,\" Seyffart noted.

The transfer involves GBTC shifting a certain percentage of its Bitcoin holdings to the new trust, effectively distributing new shares of BTC to GBTC shareholders. This distribution aims to streamline market operations and improve pricing accuracy for the trust's shares.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust will follow a similar management fee structure as the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. Hence, it set a nominal fee set at 15 basis points. A crucial aspect of this transition is the registration statement on Form S-1 for the BTC Trust.\n\nGrayscale is awaiting the SEC's final approval of this document, which is essential for the legal and regulatory authorization of the trust's shares to be offered to the public. This step is critical as it ensures compliance with regulatory standards and facilitates the trust's operations within the public market.\n\nCurrently, the record date for the initial distribution of Bitcoin Mini Trust shares is established for today, July 30, 2024. Thereafter, the 10% distribution expected to occur the following day. Grayscale's BTC ETF shareholders of record as of the close of business today will receive a one-for-one distribution of new shares in the Bitcoin Mini Trust.

But investors shouldn't worry, Grayscale said.\n\nThe decline was largely expected, as 10% of the bitcoin held by the fund was spun off to create the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust. The additional drop could be attributed to changes in bitcoin's price, which trended about 2% lower in recent trading.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust existed as a bitcoin investment fund even before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot bitcoin ETFs in January this year. Once that approval came, the existing Grayscale fund converted to a spot bitcoin (BTCUSD) ETF. However, it witnessed massive outflows, mostly on account of the comparatively higher fees it charged.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust is a new spot bitcoin ETF that comes with lower fees and offers smaller denominations than the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.\n\nA distribution of 10% of the existing fund's bitcoin holdings will seed the new ETF. So, what does that mean if you're an investor in GBTC?\n\nInvestors in GBTC as of Tuesday will be entitled to shares in the new ETF, although if you buy GBTC after Tuesday, you won't get any shares in the new fund. Existing holders will receive one share in the new ETF for each share held in GBTC.\n\nPending regulatory approval from the SEC, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust is anticipated to launch on NYSE Arca, trading under the ticker \"BTC.\"\n\nWith this new product, Grayscale hopes to offer an ETF that is more competitive with other options on the market, such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has experienced just under $20 billion of inflows since its launch in January, according to Farside Investors. Meanwhile, GBTC has posted nearly $19 billion in outflows. The iShares ETF charges a 0.25% fee versus GBTC's 1.5%.\n\nA similar situation exists with the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust; however, a key difference is that the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust was available on Day 1 of the first spot ether (ETHUSD) ETFs being available for trade on U.S. exchanges earlier this month.\n\nAs of the end of trading on Monday, ETHE has recorded roughly $1.7 billion in outflows, while the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust has received $168.9 million of inflows, according to Farside Investors.", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investopedia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NYSE_Arca", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NYSE Arca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BlackRock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/BqR-HSZTb88pI2v9_1Skv_eMboM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1918186219-ee1067c00b934ad0b90219cfba87de2f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777045", "eventUri": "eng-9777045", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

The product is being seeded with 10% of the assets from the more than decade-old Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which converted into an ETF in January.\n\nThe conversion occurred the same day that nine new Bitcoin ETFs from the likes of BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments went live, a watershed for crypto that made Bitcoin more accessible and spurred a rally in the original cryptocurrency to a record high $73,798 of in March.\n\nThe new entrants slashed fees -- in some cases to zero temporarily -- to woo customers. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust levies 1.5% and has seen an outflow of almost $19 billion since switching to an ETF structure, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It now ranks as the second-biggest Bitcoin fund, behind BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nExisting holders of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust will automatically receive shares of the mini-fund pro-rata as a distribution into their accounts.\n\n\"The timing is also excellent for investors,\" said Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale. \"We have a Federal Reserve that is about to cut rates. Crypto has become an important topic in the US presidential election. The Trump platform may favor a dollar weakness, which could have implications for investors portfolios.\"\n\nThe group of US Bitcoin ETFs has attracted $17.7 billion in net inflows since the listing of the products, part of a record-breaking debut for a fund category. The exits from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust stood out against that backdrop.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission grudgingly approved spot-Bitcoin ETFs at the start of the year in the wake of a court reversal in 2023 in a case brought by Grayscale Investments LLC.\n\nThe asset manager created the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust in 2013 and for years it was the biggest such vehicle. It used to be a closed-end product that sometimes traded at substantial premiums or discounts to its net asset value, prompting Grayscale to push for a conversion into an ETF to ensure trading at par.\n\n\"GBTC is still going to be a very important part of the crypto landscape and investors who value trading volume and tight spreads may value that product relative to our new BTC product,\" said Pandl.\n\nETFs investing in the No. 2 token by market value, Ether, have also received SEC approval and began trading in July.\n\nThe more than six-year-old Grayscale Ethereum Trust -- the largest for Ether -- converted from a closed-end structure into an ETF as part of the process. Grayscale also started the lower-fee Ethereum Mini Trust, which has attracted a net inflow of $181 million, while $1.8 billion has exited the higher-fee portfolio.\n\n--With assistance from Vildana Hajric and James Seyffart.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The distribution, set for July 30, 2024, is expected to be tax-neutral for both the trust and its shareholders.\n\nThe memorandum, released on Monday, outlines the tax treatment of the pro rata distribution of BTC Trust shares to GBTC shareholders.\n\nAccording to the document, neither the GBTC Trust nor its beneficial owners should recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the distribution. This tax stance is subject to various limitations and qualifications, including the trusts' status as grantor trusts for tax purposes and the allocation of existing tax basis between GBTC and BTC Trust shares.\n\nThe distribution is part of the Initial Distribution, which was previously announced and detailed in an information statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The GBTC Trust will contribute Bitcoin to the BTC Trust and distribute shares of the BTC Trust to GBTC shareholders on record as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date.\n\nGrayscale Investments, LLC, the sponsor of both trusts, advises shareholders and intermediaries holding GBTC or BTC Trust shares to consult with tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the distribution, including how to properly allocate the existing tax basis between the two types of shares.\n\nThe information provided in the memorandum is based on a press release statement.\n\nThe recent performance metrics of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) show a remarkable upward trajectory in investor returns, signaling a robust interest in cryptocurrency-focused investment vehicles. With a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 2.53, GBTC presents an attractive valuation compared to the broader market. This low P/E ratio suggests that investors are paying less for each dollar of earnings, which could indicate a potential undervaluation or a unique investment opportunity, especially considering the trust's substantial returns over the past year.\n\nIndeed, GBTC's one-year price total return of 218.72% demonstrates a significant appreciation in value, reflecting heightened investor confidence and a bullish outlook on Bitcoin's prospects. This is further bolstered by a year-to-date (YTD) price total return of 72.39%, which implies a strong performance since the beginning of the year. The average daily volume over the past three months, standing at 5.1 million, reflects the liquidity and active trading interest in GBTC shares.\n\nInvestors considering capitalizing on Grayscale's offerings might find these metrics especially relevant as they evaluate the potential growth and risks associated with GBTC.

The firm describes this spin-off product as a new fund coined from an existing and possibly larger one. Following the creation, both funds will exist independently in the financial market. The difference is that the new product will potentially offer lower costs to attract more investors and increase their investment options.\n\nThe investment company explained in a blog post that current holders of Grayscale's GBTC \"will automatically receive one share of the spin-off fund for each share of the original fund.\" Still, this will not alter the value of investors' portfolios.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust will be primarily traded on the securities exchange, NYSE Arca. Coinbase Custody Trust Company will be a digital asset custodian for the new ETF fund, while Foreside Fund Services will be the marketing agent.\n\nSince launching as a spot Bitcoin ETF in January, Grayscale's GBTC has recorded the most outflows year-to-date, as investors pull millions of dollars worth of BTC nearly every day.

In contrast, most financial firms offering the Bitcoin ETF product to U.S. investors implement a fee between 0.19% and 0.25%.\n\nAlthough the market data in the coming weeks may say otherwise, Grayscale's new ETF product may propel its position in the Bitcoin ETF market to new frontiers.", "source": {"uri": "cryptopotato.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoPotato"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mandy_williams@cryptopotato.com", "name": "Mandy Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinbase", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coinbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NYSE_Arca", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NYSE Arca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Grayscale_Bitcoin.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777045", "eventUri": "eng-9777045", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

This unique structure distinguishes it from most traditional investment vehicles, offering greater flexibility in its operations and investment strategies.\n\nGrayscale Investments, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency space, has unveiled its latest financial product: the Bitcoin (BTC) Mini Trust.\n\nOn July 31 2024, Grayscale announced that its Grayscale BTC Mini Trust debuted trading on the electronic securities exchange NYSE Arca at 8 am UTC. This innovative trust, officially launched on the NYSE Arca, marks a significant milestone in the evolution of crypto investment vehicles. Designed to offer a more accessible entry point into BTC investment, the BTC Mini Trust aims to democratise access to the world's leading crypto.\n\nGrayscale suggested that the Grayscale BTC Mini Trust is not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and does not fall under its regulatory framework, setting it apart from most mutual funds. Grayscale added, \"BTC's distribution event is colloquially known as a 'spin-off,' and is a corporate action that is not expected to be a taxable event for GBTC nor any beneficial owner of GBTC shares as of the previously announced record date of July 30 2024. Investors are encouraged to consult a tax advisor for related tax guidance.\"\n\nThe Grayscale BTC Mini Trust is being introduced as a spin-off from the spot BTC ETF that Grayscale began trading in January 2024 after receiving approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The BTC Mini Trust is designed to expose investors to BTC through a more manageable and smaller investment vehicle. Unlike traditional BTC investment trusts, which typically require more significant capital commitments, the Mini Trust is structured to allow for smaller, incremental investments. This design addresses a key barrier to entry for individual investors who may be hesitant to commit substantial sums to BTC.\n\nOne of the primary features of the BTC Mini Trust is its lower minimum investment threshold, which broadens accessibility for retail investors. The trust is also expected to have a more flexible structure than its larger counterparts, potentially including options for fractional shares or smaller trading increments. This flexibility aligns with Grayscale's mission to make crypto investments more user-friendly and aligned with modern trading practices. The Mini Trust will be listed on NYSE Arca, a well-established exchange known for its innovative approach to listing new financial products. By choosing NYSE Arca, Grayscale ensures that the BTC Mini Trust will benefit from the exchange's robust trading infrastructure and high visibility in the financial markets. This strategic move also underscores Grayscale's commitment to integrating crypto investment opportunities into mainstream financial platforms.\n\nThe launch of the BTC Mini Trust is poised to have several notable implications for both the crypto market and traditional investment spheres. The Mini Trust represents a significant step toward mainstream adoption for the crypto market. By lowering the barrier to entry, Grayscale is likely to attract a new wave of investors who have previously been deterred by the higher costs associated with Bitcoin investment. For traditional investors, the Mini Trust offers a new avenue to diversify their portfolios.\n\nAs digital assets continue to gain acceptance as a legitimate asset class, having a more accessible investment vehicle like the BTC Mini Trust allows investors to gain exposure without directly purchasing or managing the underlying digital assets. This can particularly appeal to institutional investors who may have been cautious about entering the crypto space due to its complexity and volatility. Additionally, the Mini Trust's introduction could stimulate further innovation in the financial sector. As traditional exchanges and financial institutions recognise the demand for more accessible crypto investment products, we may see a broader range of similar offerings emerge. This could lead to greater competition, benefiting investors through improved product features and reduced costs.\n\nThe launch of the BTC Mini Trust is just the beginning of what could be a broader expansion of crypto investment products. Grayscale's move highlights the growing trend of integrating digital assets into conventional financial markets, paving the way for more innovative solutions catering to diverse investors. In the future, we may witness the development of additional crypto trusts that focus on various digital assets beyond BTC.\n\nThese could include Ethereum (ETH), other altcoins, or even baskets of multiple cryptocurrencies, each designed to cater to different investment strategies and risk appetites. The BTC Mini Trust is a proof of concept for these potential products, demonstrating a viable market for smaller, more flexible crypto investment vehicles. Furthermore, as regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies evolve, there may be increased clarity and support for such investment products. This could lead to greater institutional involvement and potentially more favourable conditions for the growth of the crypto market.\n\nGrayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust represents a pivotal development in cryptocurrency investment. By offering a lower-cost, more accessible way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, Grayscale is helping to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world. The trust's listing on NYSE Arca is a testament to the growing integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial markets, and it sets the stage for future innovations in this exciting and rapidly evolving sector. As the financial industry adapts to the increasing demand for cryptocurrency investment opportunities, the Bitcoin Mini Trust will likely play a significant role in shaping the future of digital asset investing.", "source": {"uri": "coininsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "coininsider.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale_(band)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grayscale (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Investment fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NYSE_Arca", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NYSE Arca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_Company_Act_of_1940", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Investment Company Act of 1940"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mutual fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporate action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New wave music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.coininsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bastian-riccardi-Q08CNRiq3k0-unsplash-1067x600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777045", "eventUri": "eng-9777045", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Seyffart's insights clarified the creation of a mini Ethereum ETF (ETH) from Grayscale's Ethereum Trust (ETHE) via a spin-off.\n\nAccording to Seyffart, the creation of these mini ETFs will follow the same procedure for both Ethereum and Bitcoin. Investors holding shares of Grayscale's Ethereum Trust will receive an equal number of shares in the new mini ETH fund.\n\nThis distribution is scheduled for July 23 for Grayscale Ethereum Trust and July 31 for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Importantly, investors need to be owners of record on the specified dates -- July 18 for ETHE and July 30 for GBTC -- to receive the new shares.\n\nNotably, the spin-off mechanism has already impacted trading prices. Seyffart noted that the recent drop in ETHE's price was directly linked to the upcoming share distribution, with a similar pattern expected for GBTC on July 30.\n\nCurrently, ETHE trades at around $29 per share, while GBTC trades at around $59 per share. Post-spin-off, the new mini shares of ETH and BTC are expected to trade at lower prices, approximately $2-$3 for the ETH mini ETF and $5-$6 for the BTC mini ETF, reflecting the division of the original fund's value.\n\nAmid the update from the Bloomberg ETF analyst, Grayscale took to X to acknowledge the accuracy of the information and praise Seyffart.\n\nGrayscale emphasized that investors do not need to take any action to receive the new shares. The distribution will occur automatically, with shares reflecting in accounts shortly after the announced dates. This move aims to offer investors a choice between a lower-fee product and a fund with greater liquidity and a more extended track record.\n\nThis spin-off initiative follows Grayscale's launch of the two spot Ethereum products on NYSE Arca, further expanding its product portfolio.\n\nHowever, since these Ethereum spot ETFs commenced trading last Tuesday, ETHE has not seen positive flows. Instead, it has been drained of $1.84 billion under seven days of trading. On the other hand, the mini ETF \"ETH\" has seen a cumulative of $181 million in inflow.", "source": {"uri": "thecryptobasic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Crypto Basic - Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, DeFi Topics And News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asset management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://thecryptobasic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GrayScale-Bitcoin-Trust.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777045", "eventUri": "eng-9777045", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 662, "textEnd": 669}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 703, "textEnd": 710}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 817, "textEnd": 824}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 838, "textEnd": 845, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

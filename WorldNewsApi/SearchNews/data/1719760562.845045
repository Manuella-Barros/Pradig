Now with more than 4 million views on TikTok, the video captured how the TSA agent opened the bag, only to find an entire bag full of SPAM tinned meat. \"When TSA pulls your carry on and it's all... SPAM,\" the text overlay read.Traveling from Minneapolis back to the Boston area after a work trip, Libed had visited the Minnesota SPAM museum during the trip. \"I was traveling with a show, and we hit Austin, Minnesota, where the SPAM Museum is located,\" Libed told Newsweek. \"I was gifted that case of SPAM from a worker there. It was so sweet.\"Facing a potential baggage weight issue, Libed decided to transfer the SPAM to his carry-on. \"As I packed my suitcase to go home, it was close to being overweight, so I took all the SPAM and put it in my carry-on. I honestly didn't think much about it, but the second it got pulled off the scanner belt, I instantly got nervous,\" he said.SPAM is a brand of canned cooked pork that was first introduced by Hormel Foods Corporation in 1937. Originally created as an affordable and convenient meat product when fresh meat was scarce, it surged in popularity during World War II because it was a source of protein that didn't need refrigerating.When the TSA agent emptied the bag to check the contents, what followed was a mix of nervous laughter and mild embarrassment from Libed.\"Some of my co-workers were already cracking up, so out of nervous laughter, I told the TSA guy what it was and started recording,\" Libed said. \"I was kind of embarrassed as he pulled everything out, and people walked by and looked at it, but he was so cool about everything and let me through once we knew what it was.\"Libed later decided to share the moment on TikTok where it quickly went viral. \"I don't normally post on TikTok, but I decided to share it because I thought it was a good memory. And, wow, did the SPAM community come through,\" he said.While the video has brought plenty of smiles to faces\u2014particularly fans of the tinned meat product\u2014Libed said that his main goal is for the company to see the clip.\"I think it would be hilarious.\" he added. \"But I've honestly loved all the different experiences that people had with TSA, and also all the love for SPAM.\"", "summary": "\"Some of my co-workers were already cracking up, so out of nervous laughter, I told the TSA guy what it was and started recording,\" the man told Newsweek.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/tsa-pull-bag-suspicious-nothing-prepares-1905652", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2400384/tsa-bag-check.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:13:52", "author": "Alice Gibbs", "authors": ["Alice Gibbs"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.096}

Investigations suggest ties to the Indian government, which Canada raised concerns about last year. The suspects, identified as Brar, Karanpreet Singh, and Kamalpreet Singh, face murder and conspiracy charges. The investigation also looks into possible connections to other murders in Canada. India has denied allegations of involvement in Nijjar's killing, citing concerns about separatism and extremism in Canada. The arrests have strained relations between the two countries, leading Canada to downsize its diplomatic presence in India.\n\nCanadian police have arrested three Indian nationals believed by investigators to be members of an alleged hit squad tasked by the government of India with the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey last year, police said.\n\nThe ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the ''potential'' involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar.\n\nIndia has dismissed Trudeau's charges as ''absurd'' and ''motivated.'' Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said that three people have been arrested and charged in the killing of Sikh activist Nijjar.\n\nAddressing a press conference on Friday, he said that in addition to the murder case, separate investigations are looking into possible connections to the Government of India, The Toronto Star newspaper reported.\n\nTeboul stressed that the murder remains ''very much under active investigation,'' CTV News reported.\n\n''There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,'' he was quoted as saying by the news channel.\n\nDuring the press conference, Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, who leads the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team, said that the suspects ''were not known to the police'' before the investigation into Nijjar's death.\n\nMooker identified the suspects as Karan Brar, Karanpreet Singh and Kamalpreet Singh, all men in their 20s, who were arrested on Friday in Edmonton.\n\nMooker said all three are Indian nationals and have been living as non-permanent residents in Canada for the last three to five years.\n\nHe said coordination with India has been ''challenging and rather difficult for the last several years''.\n\nMooker said that his investigation has relied on the Sikh community's support.\n\n''We would not be at this point without the bravery and courage of the Sikh community coming forward with information for this investigation,'' he said, adding that he believes they will continue to come forward for any future investigations, according to the report.\n\nCourt documents show Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh and Karan Brar are each facing one count of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to murder in Nijjar's death.\n\nNijjar, 45, was gunned down outside his gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., on June 18, 2023. He was a Canadian citizen.\n\nCiting sources, a report in Global News said that the suspects had entered Canada on \"student visas but may have been working at the direction of Indian intelligence when they shot Nijjar.\" According to court records, Brar has been charged with a murder that occurred in Surrey on June 18, 2023. He also faces a charge of conspiracy to murder on May 1, 2023, in Edmonton and Surrey, the report said.\n\nTalking to reporters, Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc declined to confirm the Indian government connection, saying such questions are best addressed by the RCMP.\n\n''I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,'' Leblanc said.\n\n''I think the police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,'' he added.\n\nThe indictments Friday allege the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023, and the date of Nijjar's killing.\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan supporters.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a ''problem'' and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n''PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,'' External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n''This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,'' he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-Khalistan slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n''It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,'' Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its ''core issue'' with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended the issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

We hope to get regular updates from the concerned Canadian authorities regarding the arrested Indian nationals,\" Indian High Commissioner to Canada Sanjay Verma said in a statement .\n\n\"I understand that the arrests have been made as a result of investigations conducted by the relevant Canadian law enforcement agencies. This issue is internal to Canada and therefore we have no comments to offer in this regard,\" he added.\n\n\"As stated time and again, it is not the policy of the Government of India to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. We are always ready to work with partner countries in solving crimes, provided specific and relevant evidence is shared with us,\" statement reads further.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that the ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar.\n\nIndia has dismissed Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said that three people have been arrested and charged in the killing of Sikh activist Nijjar.\n\nAddressing a press conference on Friday, he said that in addition to the murder case, separate investigations are looking into possible connections to the Government of India, The Toronto Star newspaper reported.\n\nTeboul stressed that the murder remains \"very much under active investigation,\" CTV News reported.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" he was quoted as saying by the news channel.\n\nDuring the press conference, Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, who leads the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team, said that the suspects \"were not known to the police\" before the investigation into Nijjar's death.\n\nMooker identified the suspects as Karan Brar, Karanpreet Singh and Kamalpreet Singh, all men in their 20s, who were arrested on Friday in Edmonton.\n\nMooker said all three are Indian nationals and have been living as non-permanent residents in Canada for the last three to five years.\n\nHe said coordination with India has been \"challenging and rather difficult for the last several years\".\n\nMooker said that his investigation has relied on the Sikh community's support.\n\n\"We would not be at this point without the bravery and courage of the Sikh community coming forward with information for this investigation,\" he said, adding that he believes they will continue to come forward for any future investigations, according to the report.\n\nCourt documents show Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh and Karan Brar are each facing one count of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to murder in Nijjar's death.\n\nNijjar, 45, was gunned down outside his gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., on June 18, 2023. He was a Canadian citizen.\n\nCiting sources, a report in Global News said that the suspects had entered Canada on \"student visas but may have been working at the direction of Indian intelligence when they shot Nijjar.\" According to court records, Brar has been charged with a murder that occurred in Surrey on June 18, 2023. He also faces a charge of conspiracy to murder on May 1, 2023, in Edmonton and Surrey, the report said.\n\nTalking to reporters, Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc declined to confirm the Indian government connection, saying such questions are best addressed by the RCMP.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc said.\n\n\"I think the police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added.\n\nThe indictments Friday allege the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023, and the date of Nijjar's killing.\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan supporters.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a \"problem\" and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n\"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n\"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-Khalistan slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n\"It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,\" Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended the issuance of visas to Canadian citizens.

He was a Canadian citizen.\n\nCiting sources, a report in Global News said that the suspects had entered Canada on \"student visas but may have been working at the direction of Indian intelligence when they shot Nijjar.\" According to court records, Brar has been charged with a murder that occurred in Surrey on June 18, 2023. He also faces a charge of conspiracy to murder on May 1, 2023, in Edmonton and Surrey, the report said.\n\nTalking to reporters, Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc declined to confirm the Indian government connection, saying such questions are best addressed by the RCMP.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc said.\n\n\"I think the police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added.\n\nThe indictments Friday allege the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023, and the date of Nijjar's killing.\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan supporters.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a \"problem\" and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n\"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n\"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-Khalistan slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n\"It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,\" Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended the issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.

Nijjar, 45, was shot dead in June outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population. A few months later, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cited evidence of Indian government involvement, prompting a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi.\n\nPolice said the matter was still under investigation and other probes were being carried out. The three men were named as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22. \"We're investigating their ties, if any, to the Indian government,\" Mandeep Mooker, a police superintendent, told a televised news conference.\n\nNijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labeled Nijjar a \"terrorist\". Last week the White House expressed concern about the reported role of the Indian intelligence service in assassination plots in Canada and the United States.\n\nCanadian police said they had worked with U.S. law enforcement agencies, without giving additional details. The trio, all Indian nationals, were arrested in the city of Edmonton in Alberta on Friday without incident, police said. The three are due to arrive in British Columbia by Monday.\n\nTrudeau announced in September that Canadian authorities were pursuing allegations linking Indian government agents to the murder of Nijjar. New Delhi rejected Trudeau's claim as \"absurd.\" Canada had been pressing India to cooperate in its investigation. Last November, U.S. authorities said an Indian government official had directed the plot in the attempted murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist and dual citizen of the U.S. and Canada.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"},

The arrests follow Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's accusations of possible Indian involvement in Nijjar's death. India has denied the charges, citing political support for separatism in Canada. The suspects, identified as Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh, and Karan Brar, are charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The hit squad allegedly had different roles on the day of Nijjar's killing. The arrests and investigation center around potential links to other murders, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy. The arrests have put further strain on India-Canada relations, with India rejecting Trudeau's comments and summoning the Canadian deputy high commissioner.\n\nCanadian police on Friday arrested three Indian nationals believed by investigators to be members of an alleged hit squad tasked by the government of India with the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey last year, according to media reports.\n\nThe ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the ''potential'' involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar.\n\nIndia has dismissed Trudeau's charges as ''absurd'' and ''motivated.'' Three people have been arrested and charged in the killing of Sikh activist Nijjar, CTV News quoted a senior government source as saying.\n\nCourt documents show Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh and Karan Brar are each facing one count first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in Nijjar's death.\n\nNijjar, 45, was gunned down outside his gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., on June 18, 2023. He was a Canadian citizen.\n\nA report in Global News identified the suspects as Indians nationals.\n\n''The RCMP took the Indian nationals into custody on Friday morning,\" almost a year after Nijjar was gunned down, the report said.\n\nCiting sources, it said that the suspects had entered Canada on \"student visas but may have been working at the direction of Indian intelligence when they shot Nijjar.\" According to court records, Brar has been charged with a murder that occurred in Surrey on June 18, 2023. He also faces a charge of conspiracy to commit murder on May 1, 2023 in Edmonton and Surrey, the report said.\n\nThe indictments Friday allege the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023 and the date of Nijjar's killing.\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nThe men were arrested Friday during police operations in at least two provinces, the report said.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday, CTV News reported, quoting a senior government source.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan supporters.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a ''problem'' and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n''PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,'' External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n''This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,'' he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-'Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n''It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,'' Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its ''core issue'' with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

The investigation is ongoing, and more arrests are expected. Police are investigating the possible involvement of the Indian government in the murder. The three suspects are believed to be members of a hit squad tasked with killing Nijjar. The arrests have strained relations between India and Canada, which has denied involvement in the killing. India has summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner to protest the raising of pro-Khalistan slogans at an event attended by Prime Minister Trudeau.\n\nCanadian authorities, who arrested three Indian nationals in connection with the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada, have said that their investigation has not concluded and ''others'' who played a role in the homicide would also be arrested. Karan Brar, 22, Kamalpreet Singh, 22, and Karanpreet Singh, 28, all Indian nationals residing in Edmonton have been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) on Friday said they are investigating if the Indian government was involved in the killing of Nijjar, a Canadian citizen. The three are believed to be members of an alleged hit squad tasked by the government of India with the killing of Nijjar, 45, outside a gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18, 2023. \"The investigation does not end here. We are aware that there are others out there that played a role in this homicide and we remain dedicated to identifying and arresting each one of them,\" Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, Officer in Charge of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) said.\n\nThe three men were arrested for the murder of Nijjar Friday morning by IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Edmonton Police Service.\n\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said they are not able to make any comments about the nature of the evidence collected by police nor \"can we speak about the motive\" behind Nijjar's murder.\n\nWhen asked whether there are any Indian ''sleeper agents'' in Canada, Teboul said he could not say more because the issue is ''very much at the centre of evidence and ongoing investigations'', CBC News reported.\n\nAsked whether the public should consider the men to have been ''guns for hire,'' police said more information would come out in court, it said.\n\n\"However, understanding this situation has attracted considerable and very broad public interest, I will say this matter is still very much under active investigation. I will underscore that today's announcements are not a complete account of the investigative work currently underway. ''There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the Government of India.\" The ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the ''potential'' involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar.\n\nIndia has dismissed Trudeau's charges as ''absurd'' and ''motivated.'' During the press conference, Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, who leads the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team, said, ''IHIT is releasing photos of the accused men in hopes of furthering its investigation. Anyone who may have seen these individuals, in or around Surrey, in the weeks leading up to the homicide, or anyone with information about the homicide is asked to contact IHIT.\n\nHe said that the suspects ''were not known to the police'' before the investigation into Nijjar's death, according to reports.\n\nMooker said all three are Indian nationals and have been living as non-permanent residents in Canada for the last three to five years.\n\nHe said coordination with India has been ''challenging and rather difficult for the last several years''.\n\nMooker said that his investigation has relied on the Sikh community's support.\n\n''We would not be at this point without the bravery and courage of the Sikh community coming forward with information for this investigation,'' he said, adding that he believes they will continue to come forward for any future investigations, according to the report.\n\nCiting sources, a report in Global News said that the suspects had entered Canada on \"student visas but may have been working at the direction of Indian intelligence when they shot Nijjar.\" According to court records, Brar has been charged with a murder that occurred in Surrey on June 18, 2023. He also faces a charge of conspiracy to murder on May 1, 2023, in Edmonton and Surrey, the report said.\n\nTalking to reporters, Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc declined to confirm the Indian government connection, saying such questions are best addressed by the RCMP.\n\n''I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,'' Leblanc said.\n\n''I think the police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,'' he added.\n\nThe indictments Friday allege the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023, and the date of Nijjar's killing.\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nIndia on Monday summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-Khalistan slogans at the event in the presence of Prime Minister Trudeau and several other leaders.\n\nNijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its ''core issue'' with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended the issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

A few months later, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cited evidence of Indian government involvement, prompting a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police named the three men as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22.\n\n\"We're investigating their ties, if any, to the Indian government,\" Mandeep Mooker, an RCMP superintendent, told a televised news conference.\n\nAlso read: Trudeau aide: India is cooperating with Canada amid tensions over Nijjar's killing\n\nThe Indian mission in Ottawa did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labelled Nijjar a \"terrorist\".\n\nLast week the White House expressed concern about the reported role of the Indian intelligence service in assassination plots in Canada and the United States.\n\nCanadian police said they had worked with U.S. law enforcement agencies, without giving additional details, and suggested more detentions might be coming.\n\n\"This investigation does not end here. We are aware that others may have played a role in this homicide and we remain dedicated to finding and arresting each one of these individuals,\" said assistant RCMP commissioner David Teboul.\n\nThe trio, all Indian nationals, were arrested in the city of Edmonton in Alberta on Friday, police said. They are due to arrive in British Columbia by Monday.\n\nTrudeau announced in September that Canadian authorities were pursuing allegations linking Indian government agents to the murder. New Delhi rejected Trudeau's claim as absurd.\n\n\"We welcome the arrests but this does lead to a lot more questions,\" said Balpreet Singh, legal counsel and spokesperson for the Canada-based World Sikh Organization advocacy group.\n\n\"Those who have been arrested are part of a hit squad but it's clear that they were directed,\" he said by phone. Canada had been pressing India to cooperate in its investigation. Last November, U.S. authorities said an Indian government official had directed the plot in the attempted murder on U.S. soil of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist and dual citizen of the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\"While today's action is a step forward, it only scratches the surface,\" Pannun said in a statement, calling for action to \"dismantle the networks that enable and perpetuate such crimes against Canadians on Canadian soil\".\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 4, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType":

RCMP headquarters in Surrey, British Columbia\n\nOTTAWA (Reuters) -Canadian police on Friday arrested and charged three Indian men with the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year and said they were probing whether the men had ties to the Indian government.\n\nNijjar, 45, was shot dead in June outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population. A few months later, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cited evidence of Indian government involvement, prompting a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi.\n\nPolice said the matter was still under investigation and other probes were being carried out. The three men were named as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22.\n\n\"We're investigating their ties, if any, to the Indian government,\" Mandeep Mooker, a police superintendent, told a televised news conference.\n\nNijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labeled Nijjar a \"terrorist\".\n\nLast week the White House expressed concern about the reported role of the Indian intelligence service in assassination plots in Canada and the United States.\n\nCanadian police said they had worked with U.S. law enforcement agencies, without giving additional details.\n\nThe trio, all Indian nationals, were arrested in the city of Edmonton in Alberta on Friday without incident, police said. The three are due to arrive in British Columbia by Monday.\n\nTrudeau announced in September that Canadian authorities were pursuing allegations linking Indian government agents to the murder of Nijjar. New Delhi rejected Trudeau's claim as \"absurd.\"\n\nCanada had been pressing India to cooperate in its investigation. Last November, U.S. authorities said an Indian government official had directed the plot in the attempted murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist and dual citizen of the U.S. and Canada.\n\n(Reporting by David Ljunggren and Ismail Shakil;Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Josie Kao and Deepa Babington)", "source": {"uri": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

Three people have been arrested and charged in the killing of Sikh activist Nijjar, CTV News quoted a senior government source as saying.\n\nCourt documents show Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh and Karan Brar are each facing one count first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in Nijjar's death.\n\nNijjar, 45, was gunned down outside his gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., on June 18, 2023. He was a Canadian citizen.\n\nA report in Global News identified the suspects as Indians nationals.\n\n''The RCMP took the Indian nationals into custody on Friday morning,\" almost a year after Nijjar was gunned down, the report said.\n\nCiting sources, it said that the suspects had entered Canada on \"student visas but may have been working at the direction of Indian intelligence when they shot Nijjar.\" According to court records, Brar has been charged with a murder that occurred in Surrey on June 18, 2023. He also faces a charge of conspiracy to commit murder on May 1, 2023 in Edmonton and Surrey, the report said.\n\nTalking to reporters on Parliament Hill, Canada's public safety minister declined to confirm the Indian government connection on Friday, saying such questions are best addressed by the RCMP.\n\n''I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,'' Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc said.\n\n''I think the police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,'' he added.\n\nThe indictments Friday allege the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023 and the date of Nijjar's killing.\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nThe men were arrested Friday during police operations in at least two provinces, the report said.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday, CTV News reported, quoting a senior government source.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan supporters.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a ''problem'' and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n''PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,'' External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n''This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,'' he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-'Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n''It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,'' Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its ''core issue'' with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

Anyone who may have seen these individuals, in or around Surrey, in the weeks leading up to the homicide, or anyone with information about the homicide is asked to contact IHIT.\n\nHe said that the suspects ''were not known to the police'' before the investigation into Nijjar's death, according to reports.\n\nMooker said all three are Indian nationals and have been living as non-permanent residents in Canada for the last three to five years.\n\nHe said coordination with India has been ''challenging and rather difficult for the last several years''.\n\nMooker said that his investigation has relied on the Sikh community's support.\n\n''We would not be at this point without the bravery and courage of the Sikh community coming forward with information for this investigation,'' he said, adding that he believes they will continue to come forward for any future investigations, according to the report.\n\nCiting sources, a report in Global News said that the suspects had entered Canada on \"student visas but may have been working at the direction of Indian intelligence when they shot Nijjar.\" According to court records, Brar has been charged with a murder that occurred in Surrey on June 18, 2023. He also faces a charge of conspiracy to murder on May 1, 2023, in Edmonton and Surrey, the report said.\n\nTalking to reporters, Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc declined to confirm the Indian government connection, saying such questions are best addressed by the RCMP.\n\n''I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,'' Leblanc said.\n\n''I think the police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,'' he added.\n\nThe indictments Friday allege the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023, and the date of Nijjar's killing.\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nIndia on Monday summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-Khalistan slogans at the event in the presence of Prime Minister Trudeau and several other leaders.\n\nNijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its ''core issue'' with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended the issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

A few months later, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cited evidence of Indian government involvement, prompting a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police named the three men as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22.\n\n\"We're investigating their ties, if any, to the Indian government,\" Mandeep Mooker, an RCMP superintendent, told a televised news conference.\n\nThe Indian mission in Ottawa did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labelled Nijjar a \"terrorist\".\n\nLast week, the White House expressed concern about the reported role of the Indian intelligence service in assassination plots in Canada and the United States.\n\nCanadian police said they had worked with US law enforcement agencies, without giving additional details, and suggested more detentions might be coming.\n\n\"This investigation does not end here. We are aware that others may have played a role in this homicide and we remain dedicated to finding and arresting each one of these individuals,\" said assistant RCMP commissioner David Teboul.\n\nThe trio, all Indian nationals, were arrested in the city of Edmonton in Alberta on Friday, police said. They are due to arrive in British Columbia by Monday 6 May 2024.\n\nTrudeau announced in September 2023 that Canadian authorities were pursuing allegations linking Indian government agents to the murder. New Delhi rejected Trudeau's claim as absurd.\n\n\"We welcome the arrests but this does lead to a lot more questions,\" said Balpreet Singh, legal counsel and spokesperson for the Canada-based World Sikh Organization advocacy group.\n\n\"Those who have been arrested are part of a hit squad but it's clear that they were directed,\" he said by phone.\n\nCanada had been pressing India to cooperate in its investigation. Last November, US authorities said an Indian government official had directed the plot in the attempted murder on US soil of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist and dual citizen of the US and

A few months later, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cited evidence of Indian government involvement, prompting a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) named the three suspects as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22, and Karan Brar, 22.\n\n\"We're investigating their ties, if any, to the Indian government,\" RCMP Superintendent Mandeep Mooker told a televised news conference.\n\nThe Indian mission in Ottawa did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labeled Nijjar a \"terrorist.\"\n\nLast week, the White House expressed concern about the reported role of the Indian intelligence service in assassination plots in Canada and the US.\n\nCanadian police said they had worked with US law enforcement agencies, without giving additional details, and suggested more detentions might be coming.\n\n\"This investigation does not end here. We are aware that others may have played a role in this homicide and we remain dedicated to finding and arresting each one of these individuals,\" RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said.\n\nThe trio, all Indian nationals, were arrested in Edmonton, Alberta, police said.\n\nThey are due to arrive in British Columbia by tomorrow.\n\nTrudeau in September last year announced that Canadian authorities were pursuing allegations linking Indian government agents to the murder. New Delhi rejected Trudeau's claim as absurd.\n\n\"We welcome the arrests, but this does lead to a lot more questions,\" said Balpreet Singh, legal counsel and spokesperson for the Canada-based World Sikh Organization advocacy group.\n\n\"Those who have been arrested are part of a hit squad, but it's clear that they were directed,\" he said by phone.\n\nCanada had been pressing India to cooperate in its investigation.\n\nIn November last year, US authorities said that an Indian government official had directed the plot in the attempted murder on US soil of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist and dual citizen of the US and Canada.\n\n\"While today's action ... is a step forward, it only scratches the surface,\" Pannun said in a statement, calling for action to \"dismantle the

He was a Canadian citizen.\n\nA report in Global News identified the suspects as Indians nationals.\n\n\"The RCMP took the Indian nationals into custody on Friday morning,\" almost a year after Nijjar was gunned down, the report said.\n\nCiting sources, it said that the suspects had entered Canada on \"student visas but may have been working at the direction of Indian intelligence when they shot Nijjar.\" According to court records, Brar has been charged with a murder that occurred in Surrey on June 18, 2023. He also faces a charge of conspiracy to commit murder on May 1, 2023 in Edmonton and Surrey, the report said.\n\nThe indictments Friday allege the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023 and the date of Nijjar's killing.\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nThe men were arrested Friday during police operations in at least two provinces, the report said.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday, CTV News reported, quoting a senior government source.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan supporters.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a \"problem\" and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n\"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n\"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-'Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n\"It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,\" Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.

India has dismissed Mr. Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated India, which had designated Nijjar a \"terrorist.\"\n\nWill R&AW's overseas operations affect ties? | Explained\n\nAfter three Indian nationals were arrested in connection with the murder, Police in Canada said they had worked with US law enforcement agencies, without giving additional details.\n\nThe police suggested more arrests might be coming. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, the force's commander for the Pacific region, said Friday that he wouldn't comment on the alleged links between the three men arrested and Indian officials but noted the force is \"investigating connections to the government of India.\"\n\nMeanwhile, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on May 4 said what is happening in poll-bound Canada over the killing of Nijjar is mostly due to their internal politics and has nothing to do with India. He said a section of pro-Khalistan people are using Canada's democracy, creating a lobby and have become a vote bank.\n\nThe ruling party in Canada has no majority in Parliament and some parties depend on pro-Khalistan leaders, he said.\n\nIndia awaiting details about the arrest of three Indians in Canada in Nijjar murder case, says Jaishankar\n\n\"We have convinced them several times not to give visa, legitimacy or political space to such people which is causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship,\" Jaishankar said. But the Canadian government has not done anything, he said, adding that India sought the extradition of 25 people, most of whom are pro-Khalistan, but they did not pay any heed.\n\n\"Canada did not give any proof.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, the force's commander for the Pacific region, said Friday that he wouldn't comment on the alleged links between the three men arrested and Indian officials but noted the force is \"investigating connections to the government of India.\"\n\nMeanwhile, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said what is happening in poll-bound Canada over the killing of Nijjar is mostly due to their internal politics and has nothing to do with India.\n\nHe said a section of pro-Khalistan people are using Canada's democracy, creating a lobby and have become a vote bank.\n\nThe ruling party in Canada has no majority in Parliament and some parties depend on pro-Khalistan leaders, he said.\n\n\"We have convinced them several times not to give visa, legitimacy or political space to such people which is causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship,\" Jaishankar said.\n\nBut the Canadian government has not done anything, Jaishankar said, adding that India sought the extradition of 25 people, most of whom are pro-Khalistan, but they did not pay any heed.\n\n\"Canada did not give any proof.

Trudeau's remark soared ties between the two countries. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated India.

Indian authorities accused Nijjar of involvement in an alleged attack on a Hindu priest in India and announced a reward of about $16,000 for information leading to his arrest in 2022.Nijjar, an Indian-born citizen of Canada, was a plumber.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, the force's commander for the Pacific region, said Friday that he wouldn't comment on the alleged links between the three men arrested and Indian officials but noted the force is \"investigating connections to the government of India.\" Meanwhile, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said what is happening in poll-bound Canada over the killing of Nijjar is mostly due to their internal politics and has nothing to do with India.\n\nHe said a section of pro-Khalistan people are using Canada's democracy, creating a lobby and have become a vote bank.\n\nThe ruling party in Canada has no majority in Parliament and some parties depend on pro-Khalistan leaders, he said.\n\n\"We have convinced them several times not to give visa, legitimacy or political space to such people which is causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship,\" Jaishankar said.\n\nBut the Canadian government has not done anything, Jaishankar said, adding that India sought the extradition of 25 people, most of whom are pro-Khalistan, but they did not pay any heed.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n\"Canada did not give any proof.

Reuters-Yonhap\n\nCanadian police on Friday arrested three men over the killing last year in Vancouver of a Sikh separatist, whose death has been linked to the Indian government.\n\nThe murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar plunged Canada and India into a serious diplomatic crisis last fall after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suggested Indian government involvement in the homicide.\n\nIndia dismissed the allegations as \"absurd\" and responded furiously, briefly curbing visas for Canadians and forcing Ottawa to withdraw diplomats.\n\nThree Indian nationals, two aged 22 and one aged 28, were arrested Friday and charged with first degree murder and conspiracy charges. They are accused of being the shooter, driver and lookout on the day Nijjar was killed.\n\nThey were arrested by police in Edmonton, in the neighboring province of Alberta, where they reside, and are being held pending further proceedings.\n\nAll had been in Canada for between three and five years, police said at a news conference.\n\n\"This investigation does not end here.

He was a Canadian citizen.\n\nThe indictments Friday allege the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023 and the date of Nijjar's killing.\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nThe men were arrested Friday during police operations in at least two provinces, the report said.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday, CTV News reported, quoting a senior government source.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan supporters.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a \"problem\" and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n\"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n\"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-'Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n\"It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,\" Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity.\n\nSubsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was a Canadian citizen.\n\n\"The investigation does not end here. We are aware that there are others out there that played a role in this homicide and we remain dedicated to identifying and arresting each one of them,\" Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, Officer in Charge of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) said.\n\nThe three men were arrested for the murder of Nijjar Friday morning by IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Edmonton Police Service.\n\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said they are not able to make any comments about the nature of the evidence collected by police nor \"can we speak about the motive\" behind Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"However, understanding this situation has attracted considerable and very broad public interest, I will say this matter is still very much under active investigation. I will underscore that today's announcements are not a complete account of the investigative work currently underway.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the Government of India.\" The ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar.\n\nIndia has dismissed Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" Teboul said that three people have been arrested and charged in the killing of Sikh activist Nijjar.\n\nTeboul stressed that the murder remains \"very much under active investigation.\" During the press conference, Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, who leads the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team, said, \"IHIT is releasing photos of the accused men in hopes of furthering its investigation.

He also faces a charge of conspiracy to murder on May 1, 2023, in Edmonton and Surrey, the report said.\n\nTalking to reporters, Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc declined to confirm the Indian government connection, saying such questions are best addressed by the RCMP.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc said.\n\n\"I think the police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously.

The ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar.\n\nIndia has dismissed Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" Three people have been arrested and charged in the killing of Sikh activist Nijjar, CTV News quoted a senior government source as saying. Court documents show Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh and Karan Brar are each facing one count first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in Nijjar's death. Nijjar, 45, was gunned down outside his gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., on June 18, 2023. He was a Canadian citizen. Hardeep Singh Nijjar Killing: 'Sikhs for Justice' Calls for Indian Consulate 'Shutdown' in Canada After PM Justin Trudeau Alleges India's Hand in Killing of Pro-Khalistan Leader\n\nThe indictments Friday allege the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023 and the date of Nijjar's killing. Quoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton. Members of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nThe men were arrested Friday during police operations in at least two provinces, the report said. Sources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday, CTV News reported, quoting a senior government source.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence. Trudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan supporters. On the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a \"problem\" and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination. India's Ties With Canada May Have Undergone 'A Tonal Shift' in Recent Days, Says PM Justin Trudeau\n\n\"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing. \"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-'Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges. \"It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,\" Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar. Days after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country. Following Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Canadian Prime Minister said that every Sikh was feeling unsafe after Nijjar's killing. Nijjar headed the Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) and was wanted by NIA in India. He was killed by unknown assailants in British Colombia last year.\n\n\"This is important because Canada is a rule-of-law country with a strong and independent justice system, as well as a fundamental commitment to protecting all its citizens,\" Trudeau said about the arrests on Saturday at a Toronto gala celebrating Sikh heritage and culture. He said that many in Canada's Sikh community are feeling unsafe following Nijjar's killing, adding, \"Every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free from discrimination and threats of violence in Canada.\"\n\n\"As the RCMP stated, the investigation remains ongoing, as does a separate and distinct investigation not limited to the involvement of the three people arrested yesterday,\" Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) quoted Trudeau as saying.\n\nPolice Arrests 3 For Nijjar's Killing\n\nCanadian authorities arrested three Indian nationals in connection with the killing of terrorist-designate Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

They do not share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us. It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India. As election is coming in Canada, they indulge in vote bank politics,\" said Dr. Jaishankar.\n\nThe ruling party in Canada has no majority in Parliament and some parties depend on pro-Khalistan leaders, said Dr Jaishankar, adding that a section of pro-Khalistan people are using Canada's democracy, creating a lobby and have become a vote bank.\n\nIndia-Canada Ties Strained After Nijjar's Killing\n\nThe ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of 45-year-old Nijjar.

The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labeled Nijjar a \"terrorist\".\n\nCanadian police said they had worked with U.S. law enforcement agencies, without giving additional details, and suggested more detentions might be coming.\n\n(Reporting by Jatindra Dash; Writing by Arpan Chaturvedi; Editing by Ros Russell)", "source": {"uri": "streetinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StreetInsider.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karan Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhubaneswar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bhubaneswar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.

He was a Canadian citizen.\n\nThe indictments Friday allege the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023 and the date of Nijjar's killing.\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nThe men were arrested Friday during police operations in at least two provinces, the report said.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday, CTV News reported, quoting a senior government source.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan supporters.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a \"problem\" and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n\"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n\"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-'Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n\"It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,\" Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.

On June 18, 2023, Nijjar, a Canadian citizen, was shot and killed outside a gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia. \"This is important because Canada is a rule-of-law country with a strong and independent justice system, as well as a fundamental commitment to protecting all its citizens,\" Trudeau said about the arrests on Saturday, May 4.\n\nKaran Brar, Kamalpreet Singh and Karanpreet Singh residing in Edmonton are among the three Indian nationals being charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder on Friday, May 3.\n\nCanadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) quoted Trudeau, \"As the RCMP stated, the investigation remains ongoing, as does a separate and distinct investigation not limited to the involvement of the three people arrested yesterday.\" He said that many in Canada's Sikh community are feeling unsafe following Nijjar's killing. \"Every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free from discrimination and threats of violence in Canada,\" he added.\n\nAfter three Indian nationals were arrested in connection with the murder, Police in Canada said they had worked with US law enforcement agencies, without giving additional details. The police suggested more arrests might be coming.\n\nDavid Teboul, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Assistant Commissioner, the force's commander for the Pacific region, said on Friday that he wouldn't comment on the alleged links between the three men arrested and Indian officials but noted the force is \"investigating connections to the government of India.\"\n\nIndia reacts\n\nFurther to this, India has dismissed Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated India, which had designated Nijjar a \"terrorist.\"\n\nMeanwhile, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said that what is happening in poll-bound Canada over the killing of Nijjar is due to their internal politics and has nothing to do with India. He said a section of pro-Khalistan people are using Canada's democracy, creating a lobby and have become a vote bank. \"We have convinced them several times not to give visa, legitimacy or political space to such people which is causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship,\" Jaishankar said.\n\nJaishankar further added that the Canadian government has not done anything and India sought the extradition of 25 people, most of whom are pro-Khalistan, but they did not pay any heed. \"Canada did not give any proof. They do not share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us. It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India. As elections are coming in Canada, they indulge in vote bank politics,\" the minister said.", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karan Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, the force's commander for the Pacific region, said Friday that he wouldn't comment on the alleged links between the three men arrested and Indian officials but noted the force is \"investigating connections to the government of India.\"\n\nMeanwhile, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said what is happening in poll-bound Canada over the killing of Nijjar is mostly due to their internal politics and has nothing to do with India.\n\nHe said a section of pro-Khalistan people are using Canada's democracy, creating a lobby and have become a vote bank.\n\nThe ruling party in Canada has no majority in Parliament and some parties depend on pro-Khalistan leaders, he said.\n\n\"We have convinced them several times not to give visa, legitimacy or political space to such people which is causing problems for them , for us and also for our relationship,\" Jaishankar said.\n\nBut the Canadian government has not done anything, Jaishankar said, adding that India sought the extradition of 25 people, most of whom are pro-Khalistan, but they did not pay any heed.\n\n\"Canada did not give any proof. They do not share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us. It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India. As elections are coming in Canada, they indulge in vote bank politics,\" the minister said.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karan Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_nationality_law", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian nationality law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/04/17/1600x900/World_News_1713332107319_1713332146018.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 93, "textEnd": 100}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n\"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-Khalistan slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n\"It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,\" Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended the issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.

We are aware that there are others out there that played a role in this homicide and we remain dedicated to identifying and arresting each one of them,\" Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, Officer in Charge of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) said.\n\nThe three men were arrested for the murder of Nijjar Friday morning by IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Edmonton Police Service.\n\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said they are not able to make any comments about the nature of the evidence collected by police nor \"can we speak about the motive\" behind Nijjar's murder.\n\nWhen asked whether there are any Indian \"sleeper agents\" in Canada, Teboul said he could not say more because the issue is \"very much at the centre of evidence and ongoing investigations\", CBC News reported.\n\nAsked whether the public should consider the men to have been \"guns for hire,\" police said more information would come out in court, it said.\n\n\"However, understanding this situation has attracted considerable and very broad public interest, I will say this matter is still very much under active investigation. I will underscore that today's announcements are not a complete account of the investigative work currently underway.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the Government of India.\" The ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar.\n\nIndia has dismissed Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" During the press conference, Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, who leads the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team, said, \"IHIT is releasing photos of the accused men in hopes of furthering its investigation. Anyone who may have seen these individuals, in or around Surrey, in the weeks leading up to the homicide, or anyone with information about the homicide is asked to contact IHIT.\n\nHe said that the suspects \"were not known to the police\" before the investigation into Nijjar's death, according to reports.\n\nMooker said all three are Indian nationals and have been living as non-permanent residents in Canada for the last three to five years.\n\nHe said coordination with India has been \"challenging and rather difficult for the last several years\".\n\nMooker said that his investigation has relied on the Sikh community's support.\n\n\"We would not be at this point without the bravery and courage of the Sikh community coming forward with information for this investigation,\" he said, adding that he believes they will continue to come forward for any future investigations, according to the report.\n\nCiting sources, a report in Global News said that the suspects had entered Canada on \"student visas but may have been working at the direction of Indian intelligence when they shot Nijjar.\" According to court records, Brar has been charged with a murder that occurred in Surrey on June 18, 2023. He also faces a charge of conspiracy to murder on May 1, 2023, in Edmonton and Surrey, the report said.\n\nTalking to reporters, Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc declined to confirm the Indian government connection, saying such questions are best addressed by the RCMP.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc said.\n\n\"I think the police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously.

Trudeau emphasized Canada's strong justice system and the ongoing investigation into the case, including potential connections to the Indian government. The arrests have sparked concerns among the Sikh community, and Trudeau assured Canadians of their right to live safely. Indian External Minister S Jaishankar attributed the incident to Canada's internal politics and the influence of pro-Khalistan groups, who have allegedly gained political influence in the country.\n\nCanada is a ''rule-of-law country'' with a strong and independent justice system and a fundamental commitment to protect its citizens, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said, a day after three Indian nationals were charged with the murder of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\n\nNijjar, a Canadian citizen, was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18, 2023. Karan Brar, 22, Kamalpreet Singh, 22, and Karanpreet Singh, 28, all Indian nationals residing in Edmonton have been charged on Friday with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. ''This is important because Canada is a rule-of-law country with a strong and independent justice system, as well as a fundamental commitment to protecting all its citizens,'' Trudeau said about the arrests on Saturday at a Toronto gala celebrating Sikh heritage and culture.\n\n''As the RCMP stated, the investigation remains ongoing, as does a separate and distinct investigation not limited to the involvement of the three people arrested yesterday,'' Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) quoted Trudeau as saying.\n\nHe said that many in Canada's Sikh community are feeling unsafe following Nijjar's killing, adding: ''Every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free from discrimination and threats of violence in Canada.'' The ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the ''potential'' involvement of Indian agents in the killing of 45-year-old Nijjar, a Khalistan separatist.\n\nIndia has dismissed Trudeau's charges as ''absurd'' and ''motivated.'' The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated India, which had designated Nijjar a ''terrorist.'' After three Indian nationals were arrested in connection with the murder, Police in Canada said they had worked with US law enforcement agencies, without giving additional details.\n\nThe police suggested more arrests might be coming. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, the force's commander for the Pacific region, said Friday that he wouldn't comment on the alleged links between the three men arrested and Indian officials but noted the force is ''investigating connections to the government of India.'' Meanwhile, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said what is happening in poll-bound Canada over the killing of Nijjar is mostly due to their internal politics and has nothing to do with India. He said a section of pro-Khalistan people are using Canada's democracy, creating a lobby and have become a vote bank. The ruling party in Canada has no majority in Parliament and some parties depend on pro-Khalistan leaders, he said. \"We have convinced them several times not to give visa, legitimacy or political space to such people which is causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship,\" Jaishankar said. But the Canadian government has not done anything, Jaishankar said, adding that India sought the extradition of 25 people, most of whom are pro-Khalistan, but they did not pay any heed. \"Canada did not give any proof. They do not share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us. It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India. As elections are coming in Canada, they indulge in vote bank politics,\" the minister said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

The arrests stem from an alleged hit squad believed to be connected to the Indian government. Canada-India relations had worsened after PM Trudeau's accusations of Indian agent involvement. The indictments allege a conspiracy in Surrey and Edmonton in the months leading up to Nijjar's murder. Police are investigating possible links to three other murders, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy. Sources claim the hit squad members had various roles in Nijjar's killing. India has rejected Trudeau's recent remarks connecting the assassination to political issues, highlighting the support for extremism in Canada.\n\nCanadian police on Friday arrested three members of an alleged hit squad investigators here believe was tasked by the government of India with the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey last year, according to a media report.\n\nThe ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the ''potential'' involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar.\n\nIndia has dismissed Trudeau's charges as ''absurd'' and ''motivated.'' Three people have been arrested and charged in the killing of Sikh activist Nijjar, CTV News quoted a senior government source as saying.\n\nCourt documents show Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh and Karan Brar are each facing one count first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in Nijjar's death.\n\nNijjar, 45, was gunned down outside his gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., on June 18, 2023. He was a Canadian citizen.\n\nThe indictments Friday allege the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023 and the date of Nijjar's killing.\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nThe men were arrested Friday during police operations in at least two provinces, the report said.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday, CTV News reported, quoting a senior government source.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan supporters.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a ''problem'' and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n''PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,'' External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n''This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,'' he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-'Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n''It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,'' Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its ''core issue'' with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

We are aware that others may have played a role in this homicide, and we remain dedicated to finding and arresting each one of these individuals,\" Mooker said.\n\nHe added that police are \"investigating if there are any ties to the government of India\".\n\n\"However, as I said, it's an ongoing investigation and I don't have any information to provide on that matter at this time.\"\n\nNijjar was fatally shot on June 18, 2023, outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia, spurring widespread condemnation.\n\nA few months later, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the country's security agencies were investigating \"credible allegations of a potential link\" between Indian government agents and Nijjar's killing.\n\n\"Any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty,\" Trudeau said in an address to Canada's parliament in September of last year. \"In the strongest possible terms, I continue to urge the government of India to cooperate with Canada to get to the bottom of this matter.\"\n\nHis comments spurred a fierce response from India, which rejected the allegations as \"absurd\" and politically motivated. New Delhi also accused Canada of not doing enough to stem anti-India activism and \"Sikh extremism\".\n\nBut Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long faced allegations of targeting political opponents, journalists and religious minorities, including Muslims and Sikhs, in what rights groups have said is a continuing effort to stifle dissent.\n\nAt the time of Nijjar's killing, tensions had been growing between Canada and India over a Sikh campaign for a sovereign state in India's Punjab region. Known as the Khalistan movement, the campaign has supporters in Canada.\n\nNijjar served as president of the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara, the temple where he was killed. He was among those advocating for Khalistan.\n\nAsked to comment on Friday's reports that arrests were made in the case, Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc referred reporters' questions to the RCMP.\n\n\"You'll understand that the developments with respect to the murder of a Canadian citizen, Mr Nijjar, are part of an ongoing police operation. This operation started today. It is still an active police operation,\" LeBlanc said in Ottawa.\n\nThe RCMP identified the three men arrested on Friday as Kamalpreet Singh, Karanpreet Singh and Karan Brar.\n\nMooker, the police superintendent, said all three were non-permanent residents of Canada and had been in the country for between three to five years.\n\nCBC News reported earlier in the day that, according to unnamed sources, \"members of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters\" on the day Nijjar was killed.\n\n\"Sources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance,\" the Canadian broadcaster said.\n\nThe High Commission of India in Ottawa did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment on Friday afternoon.\n\nNijjar's killing continues to raise questions around allegations of Indian foreign interference, particularly within Sikh diaspora communities in Canada, the United States and other countries.\n\nIn September, Moninder Singh at the BC Gurdwaras Council told Al Jazeera that he was among five Sikh leaders -- including Nijjar -- who were warned by the RCMP's national security division in 2022 about threats against their lives.\n\nOn Friday, Danish Singh, president of the World Sikh Organization of Canada advocacy group, welcomed the arrests in Nijjar's case but said they also raise new questions.\n\n\"While the arrest of the hit squad is important, what's even more important is identifying and bringing to justice those who directed these operations,\" Singh said in a statement, accusing the Indian government of being involved.\n\nReports of an alleged plot to kill another prominent Sikh separatist leader in the US have also emerged following Nijjar's death. In late November, the US Department of Justice announced charges against a 52-year-old Indian national, Nikhil Gupta.\n\nGupta was accused of being part of a foiled attempt to assassinate US citizen Gurupatwant Singh Pannun, in coordination with an Indian government employee and others.\n\nThe Washington Post reported earlier this week that US intelligence agencies determined that the operation to target Pannun was approved by the then-head of India's foreign intelligence agency, known as RAW.\n\nThe Indian government rejected those allegations as \"unwarranted\" and \"unsubstantiated\", according to media reports.\n\nOn Monday, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre described the Washington Post report as \"a serious matter\".\n\n\"The government of India has been very clear with us that they are taking this seriously and will investigate -- and we expect that accountability from the government,\" Jean-Pierre told reporters during a news briefing.\n\nShe added that Washington would continue to raise concerns with New Delhi.", "source": {"uri": "island.lk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A few months later, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cited evidence of Indian government involvement, prompting a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police named the three men as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22.\n\n\"We're investigating their ties, if any, to the Indian government,\" Mandeep Mooker, an RCMP superintendent, told a televised news conference.\n\nThe Indian mission in Ottawa did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labeled Nijjar a \"terrorist\".\n\nLast week the White House expressed concern about the reported role of the Indian intelligence service in assassination plots in Canada and the United States.\n\nCanadian police said they had worked with U.S. law enforcement agencies, without giving additional details, and suggested more detentions might be coming.\n\n\"This investigation does not end here. We are aware that others may have played a role in this homicide and we remain dedicated to finding and arresting each one of these individuals,\" said assistant RCMP commissioner David Teboul.\n\nThe trio, all Indian nationals, were arrested in the city of Edmonton in Alberta on Friday, police said. They are due to arrive in British Columbia by Monday.\n\nTrudeau announced in September that Canadian authorities were pursuing allegations linking Indian government agents to the murder. New Delhi rejected Trudeau's claim as absurd.\n\n\"We welcome the arrests but this does lead to a lot more questions,\" said Balpreet Singh, legal counsel and spokesperson for the Canada-based World Sikh Organization advocacy group.\n\n\"Those who have been arrested are part of a hit squad but it's clear that they were directed,\" he said by phone.\n\nCanada had been pressing India to cooperate in its investigation. Last November, U.S. authorities said an Indian government official had directed the plot in the attempted murder on U.S. soil of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist and dual citizen of the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\"While today's action ... is a step forward, it only scratches the surface,\" Pannun said in a statement, calling for action to \"dismantle the networks that enable and perpetuate such crimes against Canadians on Canadian soil\".\n\n(Additional reporting by Anna Mehler Paperny in Toronto and Sarah Lynch in Washington;Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Josie Kao and Deepa Babington)",

Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, the force's commander for the Pacific region, said Friday that he wouldn't comment on the alleged links between the three men arrested and Indian officials but noted the force is \"investigating connections to the government of India.\"\n\nMeanwhile, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said what is happening in poll-bound Canada over the killing of Nijjar is mostly due to their internal politics and has nothing to do with India.\n\nHe said a section of pro-Khalistan people are using Canada's democracy, creating a lobby and have become a vote bank.\n\nThe ruling party in Canada has no majority in Parliament and some parties depend on pro-Khalistan leaders, he said.\n\n\"We have convinced them several times not to give visa, legitimacy or political space to such people which is causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship,\" Jaishankar said.\n\nBut the Canadian government has not done anything, Jaishankar said, adding that India sought the extradition of 25 people, most of whom are pro-Khalistan, but they did not pay any heed.\n\n\"Canada did not give any proof.

New Delhi also accused Canada of not doing enough to stem anti-India activism and \"Sikh extremism\".\n\nBut Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long faced allegations of targeting political opponents, journalists and religious minorities, including Muslims and Sikhs, in what rights groups have said is an ongoing effort to stifle dissent.\n\nAt the time of Nijjar's killing, tensions had been growing between Canada and India over over a Sikh campaign for a sovereign state in India's Punjab region. Known as the Khalistan movement, the campaign has supporters in Canada.\n\nNijjar served as president of the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara, the temple where he was killed. He was among those advocating for Khalistan.\n\nAsked to comment on Friday's reports that arrests were made in the case, Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc referred reporters' questions to the RCMP.\n\n\"You'll understand that the developments with respect to the murder of a Canadian citizen, Mr Nijjar, are part of an ongoing police operation.

The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labeled Nijjar a \"terrorist\". Canadian police said they had worked with U.S. law enforcement agencies, without giving additional details, and suggested more detentions might be coming.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaishankar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaishankar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

Police identified the men as Karan Brar, Kamalpreet Singh and Karanpreet Singh.\n\nPolice said the men had been living in Canada for three to five years and were not permanent residents of Canada, but would not comment on their immigration status.\n\nSeveral other investigations are ongoing and include exploring links to the Indian government's involvement, said Assistant Commissioner David Teboul of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, adding that the relationship with Indian investigative partners had been challenging.\n\nNijjar was a leader in the local Khalistan movement, which seeks to create a separate Sikh nation in India that includes the northern state of Punjab.\n\nHe was born in Punjab and moved to Canada in the heat of India's crackdown on Sikh leaders in the 1990s, according to Indian media reports. He was the leader of the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara temple in Surrey, a city outside Vancouver that is home to one of the largest Sikh populations in Canada.\n\nThe Indian government had labeled Nijjar a terrorist in 2020 and called for his arrest.\n\nHis killing set off diplomatic skirmishes between Canada and India, after Trudeau accused India of being involved in the killing on Canadian soil. The Indian government strongly denied the accusation, which led both countries to expel senior diplomats.\n\nNijjar had been one of several Sikh community members warned about threats on their life by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\nJagmeet Singh, leader of the federal New Democratic Party who represents a British Columbia district, testified last month at a foreign interference inquiry that he had also been warned by police of potential threats against his life.\n\nThe public inquiry, which delivered its interim report Friday, was established in September following increasing political pressure against Trudeau to investigate allegations that countries like China and India have interfered in Canadian elections.\n\nThe report found that Indian intelligence officials use proxies in Canada to influence communities and politicians, with a special interest in the Khalistan movement.\n\nThe arrest of the men accused of carrying out Nijjar's killing will provide little comfort to the Sikh community if Indian officials implicated in the killing and other interference activities are also not held accountable, said Balpreet Singh Boparai, a Toronto-based lawyer at the World Sikh Organization of Canada.\n\n\"We just hope that Canada has the guts to be transparent and identify those individuals who are behind this plot,\" he said.\n\nOther than a map outlining the getaway

Three Indian nationals charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Trudeau assures Sikhs' safety amidst concerns, while Indian government denies involvement allegations. Police probe potential ties to Indian government and Bishnoi crime group. External Affairs Minister Jaishankar says Canada's pro-Khalistan lobby is influencing politics and vote banks. India seeks extradition of 25 pro-Khalistan individuals, alleges lack of cooperation from Canada.\n\nCanada is a ''rule-of-law country'' with a strong and independent justice system and a fundamental commitment to protect its citizens, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said, a day after three Indian nationals were charged with the murder of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\n\nNijjar, a Canadian citizen, was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18, 2023. Karan Brar, 22, Kamalpreet Singh, 22, and Karanpreet Singh, 28, all Indian nationals residing in Edmonton have been charged on Friday with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. All three will be brought to the Lower Mainland in Vancouver, British Columbia, for a court appearance on Monday, Global News reported.\n\n''This is important because Canada is a rule-of-law country with a strong and independent justice system, as well as a fundamental commitment to protecting all its citizens,'' Trudeau said about the arrests on Saturday at a Toronto gala celebrating Sikh heritage and culture.\n\n''As the RCMP stated, the investigation remains ongoing, as does a separate and distinct investigation not limited to the involvement of the three people arrested yesterday,'' Trudeau said.\n\nPolice say they are investigating whether the Indian government was involved, an allegation made by Trudeau in the House of Commons last year, resulting in strained relations between Canada and India.\n\nHe said that many in Canada's Sikh community are feeling unsafe following Nijjar's killing, adding: ''Every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free from discrimination and threats of violence in Canada.'' Meanwhile, Global News, quoting a source familiar with the reported that Nijjar's killing was a murder-for-hire and was believed to be tied to the Bishnoi crime group, which has been implicated in drugs, extortion and killings.\n\nIts leader, Lawrence Bishnoi, has been imprisoned in India since 2014 but continues to operate from behind bars, said Shinder Purewal, a political science professor at Kwantlen Polytechnic University in Surrey.\n\nWilling to do anything for money, Bishnoi has an estimated 700 gunmen, including in Canada, where the gang is \"very active,\" he said.\n\nThe alleged hitmen entered Canada over the past five years and were suspected of involvement in the world of drug trafficking and violence, the report said.\n\nThe ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the ''potential'' involvement of Indian agents in the killing of 45-year-old Nijjar, a Khalistan separatist.\n\nIndia has dismissed Trudeau's charges as ''absurd'' and ''motivated.'' The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated India, which had designated Nijjar a ''terrorist.'' After three Indian nationals were arrested in connection with the murder, Police in Canada said they had worked with US law enforcement agencies, without giving additional details.\n\nThe police suggested more arrests might be coming. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, the force's commander for the Pacific region, said Friday that he wouldn't comment on the alleged links between the three men arrested and Indian officials but noted the force is ''investigating connections to the government of India.'' Meanwhile, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said what is happening in poll-bound Canada over the killing of Nijjar is mostly due to their internal politics and has nothing to do with India. He said a section of pro-Khalistan people are using Canada's democracy, creating a lobby and have become a vote bank. The ruling party in Canada has no majority in Parliament and some parties depend on pro-Khalistan leaders, he said. \"We have convinced them several times not to give visa, legitimacy or political space to such people which is causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship,\" Jaishankar said. But the Canadian government has not done anything, Jaishankar said, adding that India sought the extradition of 25 people, most of whom are pro-Khalistan, but they did not pay any heed. \"Canada did not give any proof. They do not share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us. It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India. As elections are coming in Canada, they indulge in vote bank politics,\" the minister said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as \"absurd.\" The police are also investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada. The Canadian police have charged three Indian nationals in connection with the murder of Khalistan separatist leader leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar, according to Canada's Global News.\n\nRelations between India and Canada became significantly tense after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made allegations last September suggesting the possible involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar.\n\nNew Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\".\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nThe men were arrested Friday during police operations in at least two provinces.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nNijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen, was shot dead on June 18, shortly following evening prayers at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan people.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a \"problem\" and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n\"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n\"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIn his comments to the media, Trudeau, referring to activities by pro-Khalistani elements, said that \"our job is not to crack down on political protest\".\n\nIndia on Monday summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-'Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n\"It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,\" Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.\n\n(With PTI inputs)", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Global News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guru Nanak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaisakhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaisakhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-109824002,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-723711,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1734, "textEnd": 1741}], "sentiment": -0.6705882352941177, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

So, they have tried to create space for themselves in the politics of these countries. I mean, at this time, it's not so much a problem in the US.\"\n\n\"Our biggest problem right now is in Canada. Because in Canada, actually, today the party in power in Canada, and other parties in Canada have given these kinds of extremism, separatism, and advocates of violence a certain legitimacy in the name of free speech. See, when you tell them something, their answer is no no we are a democratic country but it is free speech. The point that they need to understand, it is no longer a world that runs as a one-way street. If there are that which happen out there, there will be pushback. Newton's law of politics will apply there also. There will be a reaction. Others will take steps or counter it,\" he added.\n\nHe said he saw reports that three people have been arrested, and, the Canadian police have conducted 'some investigation'.\n\nNijjar was shot and killed after he had stepped out of a gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A video clip of his killing reportedly surfaced in March this year, purportedly showing Nijjar being fatally shot by assailants, in what was claimed to be 'contract killing'.\n\nJaishankar said Canada has been welcoming people from India with links to organised crime, ignoring warnings by New Delhi.\n\n\"Often, when I see for example these kinds of attacks, threats to our embassies, because they concern me very deeply and I tell the foreign minister, suppose if (they) happened to you, if it was your embassy, your diplomat, your flag, how would you react. We have to keep our position strong on this particular report which has come. I also saw it yesterday night, I was coming to Odisha in the morning, somebody may have been arrested, their police may have done some investigation,\" Jaishankar said at the event.\n\n\"But, the fact is that a number of gangland people, a number of people with organised crime links from Punjab have been made welcome in Canada. We have been telling Canada saying look these are wanted criminals from India, you have given them visas. Many of them have come in false documentation and yet you allow them to live there. If you decide to import for political purposes people with very dubious, actually, very negative backgrounds, there will be issues, they have in some cases created problems in their own country as a result of their own policies. No, why would we fear, if something happens there, it is for them to worry about,\" he added.\n\nOn May 4, Canada's New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh levelled a fresh allegation of an India hand in the killing of Nijjar. However, the Canadian police administration did not share any evidence suggesting India's involvement in the killing of the Khaliatani leader.\n\nJagmeet's party backs the Liberal minority government led by Trudeau in exchange for support on some key bills.\n\nAfter the Canadian Police announced the arrest of three alleged accused in the killing of Hardep Nijjar, Jagmeet renewed his claim of an Indian hand in the incident.\n\n\"The Indian government hired assassins to murder a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil - at a place of worship. Today 3 arrests were made. Let me be clear - any Indian agent or state actor that ordered, planned or carried out this murder must be exposed and met with the full force of Canadian law. For Canada, democracy and free speech - there must be Justice for Hardeep Singh Nijjar,\" Jagmeet posted from his X handle.\n\nIn 2023, the Canadian PM alleged an Indian hand in the killing, a claim that was vehemently denied by India which called it 'absurd and motivated'. The Canadian Police have also not given any evidence linking India to the killing.\n\nEarlier, on Friday, Canadian police released photographs of all three persons arrested in the killing of India-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year amid an ongoing probe into alleged connections of the Indian government.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in a statement named the three men, all Indian nationals, as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22 and released their photographs. The trio were arrested in Edmonton City in Alberta.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of Surrey, RCMP on Friday (local time) said that on the morning of May 3, IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta RCMP and the Edmonton Police Service, arrested the three men for the June 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey.\n\nThe trio have now been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the homicide, according to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police press release. Along with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police have also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of the evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of the murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nIndia and Canada are dealing with an unprecedented diplomatic crisis, after the Canadian Prime Minister accused agents of the Indian government of killing Canadian Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023. However, India has dismissed the accusations as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" (ANI)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The arrested individuals have been identified as Karanpreet Singh (28), Kamalpreet Singh (22), and Karan Brar (22), all of whom were residing in Edmonton, Alberta at the time of the arrest. The suspects are believed to have entered Canada to target Nijjar under the direction of the government of India.\n\nNijjar was shot dead on June 18, 2023, outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia. Indian authorities previously accused Nijjar of leading a terrorist group called \"Khalistan Tiger Force,\" which they claimed was responsible for a 2007 cinema bombing in Punjab. In 2016 Indian intelligence agencies also accused Nijjar of operating a terror camp in British Columbia to carry out attacks in Punjab. Nijjar refuted the allegations before he was murdered, however, and his death has heightened tensions between the governments of Canada and India.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau previously accused the government of India of involvement in the murder of the Sikh community leader and called for cooperation from the Indian government in the ongoing investigation into Nijjar's killing. On their side, India blocked access on YouTube and X to a Canadian investigative documentary focused on the alleged involvement of the Indian government in the murder of the Sikh activist.\n\nAccording to Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, the 3 suspects have been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The arrests are a precipitation of investigative work for over 10 months. He also thanked the RCMP national security program for its unparalleled work ethic and dedication to serving the country in the current investigations.\n\nAssistant Commissioner David Teboul stated that the police were not able to comment on the evidence collected by the police nor the motive behind the murder but noted that the matter is \"still under very active investigation.\" He added:\n\nI will underscore that today's announcements are not a complete account of the investigative work currently underway. There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into this matter, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India ... Today's enforcement actions demonstrate our relentless commitment and ability to combat the sophisticated and complex criminal threats facing our nation.\n\nThe RCMP has promised to investigate if there are any ties between the Indian government and the arrested individuals. They have also guaranteed to continue the investigations as others are suspected of having played a role in the murder of Nijjar.", "source": {"uri": "jurist.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "JURIST"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jabes_ojwang@jurist.org", "name": "Jabes Ojwang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karan Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_(police)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superintendent (police)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/01/canada_police_1578495218.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 488, "textEnd": 495}], "sentiment": -0.615686274509804, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Sikh activist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar - Medicine Hat News", "body": "Homicide police in British Columbia say they will be providing a \"significant update\" on the killing of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, amid reports that arrests have been made in the case. A portrait of Nijjar is seen as protesters gather outside the Consulate of India in response to his shooting death, in Vancouver, B.C., Saturday, June 24, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ethan CairnsSURREY, B.C. - Three Indian nationals have been charged with the murder of B.C. Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in a killing last year that threw Ottawa's relationship with New Delhi into disarray. Police say they are investigating if the Indian government was involved, an allegation raised by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the House of Commons last year. Integrated Homicide Investigation Team Supt. Mandeep Mooker said in a Surrey, B.C., news conference on Friday that the three men had been arrested in Edmonton that morning, and there may be more suspects and arrests as the investigation progresses. \"We are investigating if there are any ties to the government of India,\" Mooker said. \"However \"| it's an ongoing investigation, and I don't have any information to provide on that matter at this time.\" Nijjar was shot and killed in his pickup truck last June as he left the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, touching off a wave of protests and rallies from local communities against diplomats from India. He was the president of the gurdwara. Nijjar also campaigned for a separate Sikh homeland in India - also known as Khalistan - and organized unofficial referendums around the world about Punjabi independence. B.C. Gurdwaras Council spokesman Moninder Singh said he and Nijjar's family were briefed by investigators in Surrey about the arrests, and Nijjar's children were \"very emotional.\"\u009d \"At the moment, there is a bit of a sigh of relief in their father's murder,\"\u009d said Singh. \"There's a bit of anger and frustration around why this had to happen in the first place, and then there are a lot of questions around India. \"Is this over? How do we go back into our community and have this conversation around is this safe or is it not safe?\"\u009d Trudeau said in September that there was credible intelligence linking Nijjar's killing to the Indian government, touching off a diplomatic row that resulted in India suspending issuing visas to Canadians for two months. India has repeatedly denied involvement in Nijjar's death. RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said police in Canada have been trying to collaborate with Indian authorities on investigations such as the Nijjar case, an effort that began before his killing. \"I'll be frank, I'll characterize that collaboration as rather challenging and difficult for the last several years,\" Teboul said. \"However, the RCMP is very committed to continuing to establish a working relationship from law enforcement to law enforcement agency. So we're going to continue our efforts. \"But it's been difficult.\" Police say the three suspects arrested in Nijjar's killing - Karan Brar, Karanpreet Singh and Kamalpreet Singh - are all male Indian nationals in their 20s living in Edmonton. Mooker said the men have been in Canada for three to five years as non-permanent residents but provided no other details on their immigration status. Police say the three suspects are expected to be transported to B.C. by Monday to face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Gurpatwant Singh Pannun is a New-York-based Sikh independence activist who U.S. prosecutors say was a target in an assassination plot directed by an Indian government official. He said the arrests were \"a step forward\" but \"only scratch the surface.\" \"Shaheed Nijjar was my dear personal friend and close associate,\" Pannun said in a statement, using an honorific implying martyrdom. \"He was an upright individual, a peaceful man with demonstrated commitment to community service. \"Canadian politicians of every stripe must stand with the Canadian Sikhs' right to peacefully advocate for Khalistan without facing any violent retaliation from the Indian government.\" Federal Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said in Ottawa that he understands that members of the Indo-Canadian community and others \"may still have questions or concerns,\" and asked that they \"put their trust in the justice system.\" \"Every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free of threats of violence,\" LeBlanc said without taking questions, adding that his department will engage with community groups in the coming days. \"We want to hear their concerns and work with them to foster trust and open communications.\" In a statement, the federal Opposition Conservatives said while they are glad arrests were made, the party wished the Canadian government could have foiled the killing of Nijjar \"as was the case in the United States,\" a reference to the alleged assassination plot there. B.C. Premier David Eby said Nijjar's killing had \"shaken the Sikh community in British Columbia, the larger South Asian community, and Canadians across the country.\" \"I hope that today's announcement of charges against three individuals is an important step towards justice for his family and accountability to the whole community,\" he said in a statement. The World Sikh Organization of Canada said it welcomed the news of the arrest of three members of an \"alleged hit squad that assassinated\"\u009d Nijjar. But the group said in a statement that it believes the arrests raise disturbing questions about the connection between India's government and criminal gangs. It noted that the report by the Foreign Interference Commission says India uses proxies in Canada who work with intelligence officials in Indian and Canada. An interim report into foreign interference released Friday in Ottawa said Indian officials engaged in a range of activities to influence Canada's communities and politicians. It says India's interests in Canada related to the large South Asian community in the country. \"India does not differentiate between lawful, pro-Khalistani political advocacy and the relatively small Canada-based Khalistani violent extremism,\"\u009d the report says. Indian officials in Canada have increasingly relied on Canadian proxies and contacts in its network to conduct foreign interference, the report says. \"It views anyone aligned with Khalistani separatism as a seditious threat to India. Targets of Indian foreign interference are often members of the Indo-Canadian communities, but prominent non-Indo-Canadians are also subject to India's foreign influence activities.\"\u009d - By Chuck

leader, probes India link", "body": "Canadian police have arrested three Indian nationals over assassination of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year, which sparked a diplomatic tension between Ottawa and New Delhi.\n\nThe Canadian police made the first arrests regarding the murder on Friday in Edmonton, Alberta, charging the accused named as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22, with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nLast year, diplomatic ties between two former British colonies hit rock bottom after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the \"agents of the government of India\" of planning the shooting.\n\nMandeep Mooker, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) superintendent and head of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team for the Mounties, told a televised news conference that they were interrogating whether the three culprits have ties, if any, with the Indian government.\n\n\"This investigation does not end here,\" Mooker said. \"We are aware that others may have played a role in this homicide, and we remain dedicated to finding and arresting each one of these individuals.\"\n\nNijjar, a Canadian citizen, leader of the Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) who advocated for the establishment of Khalistan, a separate Sikh homeland, was fatally shot while sitting in his vehicle outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia on the evening of June 18th.\n\nThe assailants, two masked men, fled the scene by running through a park and disappearing.\n\nIn India, Nijjar was a wanted terrorist, with a reward of one million Indian rupees offered for his capture.\n\nThe Khalistan movement aims to establish an independent Sikh state in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan, advocating for Sikh separatism.\n\nThe existence of Sikh separatist organizations in Canada, which houses the world's largest Sikh diaspora community, along with the US and the UK has been a source of ongoing frustration for the Indian government.\n\nThree months after the murder, Trudeau declared in the House of Commons that Canada was looking into \"credible allegations\" that could potentially connect the Indian government to the assassination.\n\nThe Indian government has dismissed the accusations as \"absurd\" and urged the Canadian authorities to crack down on the activities of individuals it calls \"terrorists\", a reference to Sikh separatists.\n\nThe diplomatic row worsened after Canada expelled the head of India's intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), in Canada, Pavan Kumar Rai, who was accused of either ordering or assigning someone to kill Nijjar.\n\nIndia also expelled a Canadian diplomat, and further suspended visa applications for Canadians.\n\nThe tussle forced Ottawa to withdraw two-thirds of its diplomats based in India.\n\nIn November last year, American authorities revealed that an Indian government official was implicated in a conspiracy to carry out the assassination of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, another Sikh separatist who holds dual citizenship in the US and Canada.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org",

He was a Canadian citizen.\n\nA report in Global News identified the suspects as Indians nationals.\n\n\"The RCMP took the Indian nationals into custody on Friday morning,\" almost a year after Nijjar was gunned down, the report said.\n\nCiting sources, it said that the suspects had entered Canada on \"student visas but may have been working at the direction of Indian intelligence when they shot Nijjar.\" According to court records, Brar has been charged with a murder that occurred in Surrey on June 18, 2023. He also faces a charge of conspiracy to commit murder on May 1, 2023 in Edmonton and Surrey, the report said.\n\nThe indictments Friday allege the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023 and the date of Nijjar's killing.\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nThe men were arrested Friday during police operations in at least two provinces, the report said.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday, CTV News reported, quoting a senior government source.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan supporters.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a \"problem\" and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n\"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n\"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-'Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n\"It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,\" Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.

The incident strained relations between India and Canada, with allegations of Indian agent involvement by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Investigators are examining possible links to other murders. The suspects were arrested during raids in multiple provinces. Trudeau's comments about the killing have been criticized by India, which has accused Canada of tolerating separatism and extremism. India has summoned a Canadian diplomat to protest pro-Khalistan slogans raised at an event attended by Trudeau.\n\nCanadian police on Friday arrested members of an alleged hit squad investigators here believe was tasked by the government of India with the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey last year, according to media reports.\n\nThe ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the ''potential'' involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar.\n\nIndia has dismissed Trudeau's charges as ''absurd'' and ''motivated.'' Quoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nThe men were arrested Friday during police operations in at least two provinces, the report said.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday, CTV News reported, quoting a senior government source. Nijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen, was shot dead on June 18, shortly after evening prayers at his Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan supporters.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a ''problem'' and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n''PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,'' External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n''This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,'' he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-'Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n''It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,'' Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its ''core issue'' with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

This comes after the Canadian Police on Friday charged the three men over the murder of Nijjar and said that they were investigating if the suspects had links to the Indian government.\n\nJaishankar said that he had seen the news about the arrests made and added that they \"apparently are Indians of some kind of gang background... We'll have to wait for the police to tell us\".\n\n\"But, as I said, one of our concerns which we have been telling them is that, you know, they have allowed organised crime from India, specifically from Punjab, to operate in Canada,\" Jaishankar added.\n\nIndia's high commissioner to Canada Sanjay Verma said that it hopes to get regular updates from the Canadian authorities regarding the three arrested Indians.\n\n\"I understand that the arrests have been made as a result of investigations conducted by the relevant Canadian law enforcement agencies. This issue is internal to Canada and therefore we have no comments to offer in this regard,\" Verma said.\n\nThe three Indian nationals were arrested in the city of Edmonton in Alberta on Friday, the police said.\n\nNijjar, 45, was shot dead in June outside a gurdwara in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population. A few months later, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged Indian government involvement, stirring a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi.\n\nNijjar, a Canadian citizen, was shot dead by two unidentified men outside a gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18, 2023. \"The investigation does not end here. We are aware that there are others out there that played a role in this homicide and we remain dedicated to identifying and arresting each one of them,\" Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, Officer in Charge of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) said.\n\nEarlier, a purported video footage of the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by the National Investigation Agency in 2020, surfaced online. In the video Nijjar is seen being shot by armed men in what has been described as a 'contract killing', Canada-based CBC News reported.

They do not share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us. It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India.

This arrest has heightened tensions between India and Canada, with Canada accusing India of potential involvement in Nijjar's death while India denies allegations. The hit squad members are linked to three other murders, including the death of an 11-year-old in Edmonton. India has condemned Canada's tolerance for separatists and extremists, claiming it encourages violence and crime. Canada has responded by reducing its diplomatic presence in India and temporarily suspending visa services. The ongoing investigation has raised concerns about foreign influence on Canadian soil.\n\nCanadian police have arrested members of an alleged hit squad investigators believe was tasked by the government of India with killing Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, according to a media report on Friday.\n\nThe ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the ''potential'' involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar.\n\nNew Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as ''absurd''.\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nThe men were arrested Friday during police operations in at least two provinces. Sources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance. Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday, the report said.\n\nNijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen, was shot dead on June 18, shortly after evening prayers at his Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan people.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a ''problem'' and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n''PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well.

New Delhi also accused Canada of not doing enough to stem anti-India activism and \"Sikh extremism\".\n\nBut Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long faced allegations of targeting political opponents, journalists and religious minorities, including Muslims and Sikhs, in what rights groups have said is an ongoing effort to stifle dissent.\n\nAt the time of Nijjar's killing, tensions had been growing between Canada and India over over a Sikh campaign for a sovereign state in India's Punjab region. Known as the Khalistan movement, the campaign has supporters in Canada.\n\nNijjar served as president of the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara, the temple where he was killed. He was among those advocating for Khalistan.\n\nAsked to comment on Friday's reports that arrests were made in the case, Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc referred reporters' questions to the RCMP.\n\n\"You'll understand that the developments with respect to the murder of a Canadian citizen, Mr Nijjar, are part of an ongoing police operation. This operation started today. It is still an active police operation,\" LeBlanc said in Ottawa.\n\nAccording to CBC News, those arrested on Friday \"played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was

None have obtained permanent residency.\n\nAll are alleged associates of a criminal group in Punjab and neighbouring Haryana state that is associated with notorious Punjabi gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, currently held in India's high-security Sabarmati prison in Ahmedabad, in Gujarat, according to sources close to the investigation.\n\nHardeep Nijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen, was shot dead on June 18, shortly after evening prayers at his Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., in what appeared to be a highly coordinated attack, according to video of the incident obtained by CBC's The Fifth Estate programme. The Fifth Estate shows how the killing of a Sikh Canadian activist was carried out, allegedly by agents of the government of India. That programme has been banned on Youtube in India.\n\nCanadian officials has told representatives of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in person that Canada had intelligence linking it to Nijjar's killing.\n\nOn Sept 18, 2023, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rose in the House of Commons to state that \"Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India\" and Nijjar's killing.\n\n\"Any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty,\" he added.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said any foreign government involvement in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is \"an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty\".\n\nDuring a roundtable with Canadian Punjabi media on Sunday, Trudeau said the work by intelligence and police agencies was ongoing.\n\n\"It is very good and rigorous work. And when the time comes for them to conclude that investigation, there will be some very, very clear things that everyone around the world, including in India, will see as to responsibilities and involvement,\" he said.\n\nIn a press conference on Friday, Minister of Public Safety Dominic LeBlanc confirmed Canadian Police have charged three men with first-degree murder in connection to Nijjar's death.\n\nThey are: Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh, and Karan Brar. They are also facing one count each of conspiracy to commit murder in connection to a May 1 offence in Edmonton and Surrey.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News

The external affairs minister's response, during an interaction with senior journalists during a visit to Bhubaneswar, comes after Canadian police charged the three on Friday over the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and said they were probing whether the suspects had links to the Indian government.\n\nJaishankar said India will wait for Canadian police to share information on the three Indian men it has arrested. The minister said he had seen news of the arrests and said the suspects \"apparently are Indians of some kind of gang background... we will have to wait for the police to tell us.\"\n\nAlso Read | Men arrested in Hardeep Nijjar's killing may be members of Lawrence Bishnoi gang, claims Canadian media\n\n\"But, as I said, one of our concerns which we have been telling them is that, you know, they have allowed organised crime from India, specifically from Punjab, to operate in Canada,\" Reuters quoted Jaishankar as saying.\n\nS Jaishankar also said India needs a strong and active prime minister like Narendra Modi to bring further reforms in various sectors, including external affairs, to make a \"Viksit Bharat (developed India)\".\n\n\"India's image globally is now actually much much higher than it had been ever... Canada is an exception. You see the different country heads are praising Bharat and its Prime Minister,\" news agency PTI quoted Jaishankar as saying.\n\nAlso Read | Nijjar killing accused Karanpreet Brar's family in shock in Punjab's Kotkapura\n\nThe EAM said a section of pro-Khalistan people is using Canada's democracy, creating a lobby and has become a vote bank. The ruling party in Canada has no majority in Parliament and some parties depend on pro-Khalistan leaders, Jaishankar claimed.\n\n\"We have convinced them several times not to give visa, legitimacy or political space to such people which is causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship,\" Jaishankar was quoted as saying by PTI.\n\nBut the Canadian government, Jaishankar said, was yet to do anything. According to Jaishankar, India has sought the extradition of 25 people, most of whom are pro-Khalistan, but Canada did not pay any heed.\n\nThe three Indians were arrested in the city of Edmonton in Alberta on Friday, police said. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police revealed that three Indian citizens living in Edmonton had been arrested. Karan Brar and Kamalpreet Singh, both 22, and Karanpreet Singh, 28, have each been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nAlso Read | Canadian authorities charge three persons in connection with the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, 45, was shot dead in June last year outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population. A few months later, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cited credible allegations of Indian government involvement, prompting a diplomatic row with New Delhi. India has dismissed Justin Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated\".\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labelled Nijjar a \"terrorist\".\n\nCanadian police said they had worked with US law enforcement agencies without giving additional details and suggested more detentions might be coming.\n\n\"Canada did not give any proof. They do not share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us. It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India. As election is coming in Canada, they indulge in vote bank politics,\" Jaishankar said on Saturday.\n\nSanjay Verma, India's high commissioner to Canada, said that it hopes to get regular updates from Canadian authorities regarding the three arrested Indians, Reuters reported.\n\n\"I understand that the arrests have been made as a result of investigations conducted by the relevant Canadian law enforcement agencies.

They are accused of being the shooter, driver and lookout on the day Nijjar was killed.\n\nThey were arrested by police in Edmonton, in the neighboring province of Alberta, where they reside, and are being held pending further proceedings.\n\nAll had been in Canada for between three and five years, police said at a news conference.\n\n\"This investigation does not end here.

said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning.\n\nThe shock allegations came after US President Joe Biden hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a rare state visit, as Washington seeks closer ties with India against China's growing influence.\n\nUS intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India's top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, The Washington Post reported this week.\n\nCanada is home to some 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two percent of the country's population, with a

Each is an Indian citizen with non-permanent resident status who has been living in Canada from three to five years, police said. They were identified as Karan Brar, 22; Kamalpreet Singh, 22; and Karanpreet Singh, 28.\n\n\"The murder of Mr. Nijjar ... was outrageous and it was reprehensible,\" said Brian Edwards, assistant commissioner of the Surrey RCMP. \"It had a profound impact on the residents of Surrey, and notwithstanding the announcing of charges, those scars will remain in our community for some time.\"\n\nThe arrests came more than seven months after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told lawmakers that authorities were pursuing \"credible allegations\" that agents of the Indian government were behind the deadly attack on Nijjar as he was leaving the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in his truck in Surrey, B.C., on June 18.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government reacted with fury to Trudeau's announcement in September, calling it \"motivated and absurd.\" The incident sent relations between Ottawa and New Delhi tumbling to a new low at a time when Canada and its allies had been trying to court India as a diplomatic and trade counterweight to China.\n\nCanada expelled the station chief of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), India's spy agency, in Ottawa. India expelled a Canadian diplomat in retaliation. Trade talks between the two countries were suspended, and Canada withdrew 41 diplomats from India after New Delhi threatened to revoke their diplomatic status.\n\nThe Indian High Commission in Ottawa, the the equivalent among Commonwealth nations of an embassy, said in an email that High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma was travelling out of Ottawa and unable to respond.\n\nNijjar's killing was part of a campaign of repression, surveillance and harassment by RAW against critics of the Modi government in the Indian diaspora, The Washington Post reported this week. The effort also included the foiled assassination attempt last year against Gurpatwant Singh Pannun on U.S. soil. Pannun, a U.S. citizen and Sikh activist, was an associate of Nijjar.\n\nThe Post found that U.S. intelligence agencies believe the plot against Pannun was approved by Samant Goel, then the head of RAW. The agencies have tentatively assessed that Modi's national security adviser was probably aware of the plans, but they stressed that no smoking-gun proof had emerged.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice last year charged Nikhil Gupta in the Pannun case. Gupta, described in a U.S. indictment as an Indian drug and weapons trafficker enlisted to hire a contract killer, has denied the charges. He was arrested in Prague last year and is challenging his extradition to the United States.\n\nIndia appointed a special panel to investigate the plot against Pannun. But it has been far less cooperative with Canadian authorities, saying they have provided no evidence for their assertions. Canadian officials, including the country's spy chief and the prime minister's former national security adviser, have traveled to India to discuss the case with their counterparts.\n\nNijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen born in India, advocated for an autonomous Sikh homeland in India's Punjab state to be called Khalistan and organized nonbinding referendums on Sikh statehood in Canada. Indian security agencies designated him a terrorist in 2020, accused him in 2022 of links to the slaying of a Hindu priest in Punjab and sought his extradition.\n\nA Canadian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive law enforcement matter, said Brar, Singh and Singh are believed to be part of an organized crime network that is acting on behalf of the Indian government and its intelligence apparatus.\n\nAuthorities on Friday did not rule out additional arrests in the Nijjar case. A security video of the slaying reviewed by The Post last year reviewed revealed the plot was more complex than police initially indicated, involving at least six people and two vehicles.\n\n\"The investigation does not end here,\" said Mandeep Mooker, a superintendent with the RCMP's Integrated Homicide Investigative Unit. \"We are aware that others may have played a role in this homicide, and we remain dedicated to finding and arresting each one of those individuals.\"\n\nThe probe involved collaboration with counterparts from around the world, including the United States, authorities said. But working with Indian authorities, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul told reporters, proved \"rather challenging\" and \"difficult.\"\n\nNew Delhi has long accused Canada of harboring Sikh extremists who it claims are plotting attacks and organizing rallies in support of the Khalistan movement. Modi's Hindu nationalist government views that movement as a terrorist threat.\n\nCanadian officials have denied those charges. They say they will prosecute criminal activity, but must uphold Canadian rights to free speech and peaceful assembly. Canada is home to the world's largest Sikh diaspora community.\n\nNijjar was among several Sikh separatist leaders in Canada who were warned by Canadian law enforcement of threats to their lives. Sikh advocates here have long complained that Indian officials have sought to harass and intimidate them on Canadian soil but authorities here have not taken the threat seriously enough.\n\nOn Friday, a preliminary report in a public inquiry into foreign interference in Canada named India as one of several countries attempting to meddle in Canadian affairs.\n\nIndian officials, Quebec Court of Appeal Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue wrote, \"have increasingly relied on Canadian and Canadian-based proxies to conduct foreign interference\" to \"obfuscate any explicit link\" with New Delhi. Proxies liaise with Indian intelligence officials in India and Canada, she added, \"taking both explicit and implicit direction from them.\"\n\n\"Targets of Indian foreign interference are often members of the Indo-Canadian communities,\" Hogue wrote, \"but prominent non-Indo-Canadians are also subject to India's foreign influence activities.\"\n\nAsked whether the men arrested Friday might be Indian sleeper agents, Teboul said he wasn't \"at liberty to answer.\"\n\n\"It is a great question,\" he said, \"but it is a matter very much at the center of evidence and ongoing investigations.\"", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp", "dataType": "news", "title": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs",

A few months later, Justin Trudeau cited credible allegations of Indian government involvement, prompting a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi. India has dismissed Justin Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated\".\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan.

He added that India sought the extradition of 25 people, most of whom are pro-Khalistan, but they did not pay any heed.\n\n\"Canada did not give any proof.

Sikh activist, Nijjar - Medicine Hat News", "body": "Homicide police in British Columbia say they will be providing a \"significant update\" on the killing of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, amid reports that arrests have been made in the case. A portrait of Nijjar is seen as protesters gather outside the Consulate of India in response to his shooting death, in Vancouver, B.C., Saturday, June 24, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ethan CairnsSURREY, B.C. - Three Indian nationals have been charged with the murder of B.C. Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in a killing last year that threw Ottawa's relationship with New Delhi into disarray. Police say they are investigating if the Indian government was involved, an allegation raised by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the House of Commons last year. Integrated Homicide Investigation Team Supt. Mandeep Mooker said in a news conference on Friday that the three men had been arrested in Edmonton that morning, and there may be more suspects and arrests as the investigation progresses. \"We are investigating if there are any ties to the government of India,\" Mooker said. \"However \"| it's an ongoing investigation, and I don't have any information to provide on that matter at this time.\" Nijjar was shot and killed in his pickup truck last June as he left the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., touching off a wave of protests and rallies from local communities against diplomats from India. He was the president at the gurdwara where he was killed. Nijjar also campaigned for a separate Sikh homeland in India - also known as Khalistan - and organized unofficial referendums around the world about Punjabi independence. B.C. Gurdwaras Council spokesman Moninder Singh said he and Nijjar's family were briefed by investigators in Surrey about the arrests, and Nijjar's children were \"very emotional.\"\u009d \"At the moment, there is a bit of a sigh of relief in their father's murder,\"\u009d said Singh. \"There's a bit of anger and frustration around why this had to happen in the first place, and then there are a lot of questions around India. \"Is this over? How do we go back into our community and have this conversation around is this safe or is it not safe?\"\u009d Trudeau said in September that there was credible intelligence linking Nijjar's killing to the Indian government, touching off a diplomatic row that resulted in India suspending issuing visas to Canadians for two months. India has repeatedly denied involvement in Nijjar's death. RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said police in Canada have been trying to collaborate with Indian authorities on investigations such as the Nijjar case, an effort that began before his killing. \"I'll be frank, I'll characterize that collaboration as rather challenging and difficult for the last several years,\" Teboul said. \"However, the RCMP is very committed to continuing to establish a working relationship from law enforcement to law enforcement agency. So we're going to continue our efforts. \"But it's been difficult.\" Police say the three suspects arrested in Nijjar's killing, Karan Brar, Karanpreet Singh and Kamalpreet Singh are all male Indian nationals in their 20s living in Edmonton. Mooker said the men have been in Canada for three to five years as non-permanent residents but provided no other details on their immigration status. Police say the three suspects are expected to be transported to B.C. by Monday to face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Gurpatwant Singh Pannun is a New-York-based Sikh independence activist who U.S. prosecutors say was a target in an assassination plot directed by an Indian government official. He said the arrests were \"a step forward\" but \"only scratch the surface.\" \"Shaheed Nijar was my dear personal friend and close associate,\" Pannun said in a statement, using an honorific implying martyrdom. \"He was an upright individual, a peaceful man with demonstrated commitment to community service. \"Canadian politicians of every stripe must stand with the Canadian Sikhs' right to peacefully advocate for Khalistan without facing any violent retaliation from the Indian Government.\" The World Sikh Organization of Canada echoed those sentiments, saying it welcomed the news of the arrest of three members of an \"alleged hit squad that assassinated\"\u009d Nijjar. But the group said in a statement that it believes the arrests raise disturbing questions about the connection between India's government and criminal gangs. It noted that the report by the Foreign Interference Commission says India uses proxies in Canada who work with intelligence officials in Indian and Canada. An interim report into foreign interference released Friday in Ottawa said Indian officials engaged in a range of activities to influence Canada's communities and politicians. It says India's interests in Canada related to the large South Asian community in the country. \"India does not differentiate between lawful, pro-Khalistani political advocacy and the relatively small Canada-based Khalistani violent extremism,\"\u009d the report says. Indian officials in Canada have increasingly relied on Canadian proxies and contacts in its network to conduct foreign interference, the report says. \"It views anyone aligned with Khalistani separatism as a seditious threat to India. Targets of Indian foreign interference are often members of the Indo-Canadian communities, but prominent non-Indo-Canadians are also subject to India's foreign influence activities.\"\u009d -- By

Three people have been arrested and charged in the killing of Nijjar, CTV News quoted a senior government source as saying.\n\nCourt documents show Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh and Karan Brar are each facing one count of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in Nijjar's death.\n\nNijjar, 45, was gunned down outside a gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., on June 18, 2023. He was a Canadian citizen.\n\nThe indictments on Friday allege the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023 and the date of Nijjar's killing.\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed, according to the sources.\n\nThe men were arrested on May 3 during police operations in at least two provinces, the report said.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later on May 3, CTV News reported, quoting a senior government source.\n\nIndia on May 2 rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism and violence.\n\nMr. Trudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on April 28 that was attended by some pro-Khalistan supporters. On the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar created a \"problem\" and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n\"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n\"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he said when asked about Mr. Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on May 29 also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-Khalistan slogans at the event in the presence of Mr. Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\nDays after Mr. Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country. Following Mr. Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n\"It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,\" Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) has now released the pictures and identities of all three accused, who were arrested in Edmonton City in Alberta.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigative Team (IHIT) announced the identities of the trio - Karan Brar, 22, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karanpreet Singh, 28. All of them have been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the homicide. They were arrested on Friday with the help of Alberta RCMP, IHIT investigators and members from the British Columbia province.\n\nAlong with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police have also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area. \"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of evidence... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" said RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul.\n\nNijjar, a Canadian citizen, was shot dead by two unidentified men outside a gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18, 2023. \"The investigation does not end here. We are aware that there are others out there that played a role in this homicide and we remain dedicated to identifying and arresting each one of them,\" Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, Officer in Charge of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) said.\n\nEarlier, a purported video footage of the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by the National Investigation Agency in 2020, surfaced online. In the video Nijjar is seen being shot by armed men in what has been described as a 'contract killing', Canada-based CBC News reported. The video showed Nijjar leaving the parking lot of the Gurdwara in his grey Dodge Ram pickup truck.\n\nSources said Canadian investigators identified the alleged hit squad members, who were arrested on Friday, in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance. Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday, as per reports.\n\nPolice personnel have not given any evidence of any link to India as was being speculated in Canadian media, including the bombshell allegations made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in September last year. India has repeatedly denied the allegations, terming them \"absurd and motivated.\"\n\nThe ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar. New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\". Days after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country. Following Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended the issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.\n\nRecently, India raised a strong protest after 'pro-Khalistan' slogans were raised at a public event which was attended by Trudeau in Toronto. In an official statement, the government has informed that Canadian Deputy High Commissioner Stewart Wheeler has been summoned to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) with regard to the raising of separatist slogans on 'Khalistan' at an event which was being personally addressed by the Prime Minister of Canada.\n\n\"The Government of India's deep concern and strong protest was conveyed at such disturbing actions being allowed to continue unchecked at the event. This illustrates once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism and violence,\" the MEA said.\n\n(with inputs from agencies)\n\nALSO READ | Canadian Police

Canadian police said Friday, May 3, 2024, that they have made three arrests in the June slaying. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP, File)\n\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Canadian police said they arrested three suspects Friday in the slaying of a Sikh separatist leader last June that become the center of a diplomatic spat with India, and are investigating possible ties between the detainees and the Indian government.\n\nThree Indian nationals in their 20s identified as Kamalpreet Singh, Karan Brar and Karampreet Singh were arrested in Edmonton, Alberta on Friday morning in the slaying of 45-year-old Hardeep Singh Nijjar by masked gunmen outside Vancouver, police said.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sparked a diplomatic feud with India in September when he said that there were \"credible allegations\" of Indian involvement in the slaying of Nijjar.\n\nIndia had accused Nijjar of links to terrorism, but angrily denied involvement in the slaying. In response to the allegatio ns, India told Canada last year to remove 41 of its 62 diplomats in the country. Tensions remain but have somewhat eased since.\n\nThe three suspects had been living in Canada as non-permanent residents, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superintendent Mandeep Mooker said Friday at a news conference in Toronto.\n\n\"We are investigating whether there are any ties to the government of India,\" Mooker said, adding that it was an \"ongoing investigation.\"\n\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said Canadian authorities are speaking to counterparts in India. \"I would characterize that collaboration as rather challenging,\" he said. \"It's been very difficult.\"\n\nThe three men were expected to be transported to British Columbia by Monday to face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nNijjar, an Indian-born citizen of Canada, was a plumber and also a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland, known as Khalistan. But he had denied allegations of ties to terrorism.\n\nA bloody decadelong Sikh insurgency shook north India in the 1970s and 1980s, until it was crushed in a government crackdown in which thousands of people were killed, including prominent Sikh leaders.\n\nThe Khalistan movement has lost much of its political power but still has supporters in the Indian state of Punjab, as well as in the sizable overseas Sikh diaspora. While the active insurgency ended years ago, the Indian government has warned repeatedly that Sikh separatists were trying to make a comeback.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalherald.com", "dataType":

This issue is internal to Canada and therefore we have no comments to offer in this regard,\" Verma added.\n\nThe trio, all Indian nationals, were arrested in the city of Edmonton in Alberta on Friday, police said.\n\nNijjar, 45, was shot dead in June outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population. A few months later, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cited credible allegations of Indian government involvement, prompting a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi.\n\nNijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labeled Nijjar a \"terrorist.\"\n\nCanadian police said they had worked with U.S. law enforcement agencies, without giving additional details, and suggested more detentions might be coming.\n\n--\n\n(Reporting by Jatindra Dash and by Promit Mukherjee in Ottawa; Additional Reporting by Rishabh Jaiswal;Writing by Arpan ChaturvediEditing by Ros Russell and Diane Craft)", "source": {"uri": "cp24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pulse24.com                        "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

India has repeatedly denied the allegations, terming them \"absurd and motivated.\"\n\nGiving an address at the Sikh Foundation of Canada's Centennial Gala event held at the Royal Ontario Museum on Sunday, Trudeau began by acknowledging the arrests made in connection to the case, emphasising that the investigation remains ongoing.\n\n\"I need to begin, somewhat awkwardly perhaps, but importantly, to acknowledge the arrests that were made in relation to the murder of Nijjar. As the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) stated, the investigation remains ongoing, as does a separate and distinct investigation, not limited to the involvement of the three people arrested yesterday,\" he said.\n\nHe highlighted Canada's status as a rule-of-law country with a robust and independent justice system. \"This is important because Canada is a rule-of-law country with a strong and independent justice system, as well as a fundamental commitment to protecting all its citizens. I know that many Canadians, particularly members of the Sikh community, are feeling uneasy and perhaps even frightened right now,\" Trudeau added.\n\nTrudeau also reassured that every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free from discrimination and violence. He urged them to \"remain calm... remain steadfast in our commitment to our democratic principles and our system of justice. This is who we are and what we do as Canadians\".\n\nA day ago, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Canada has been issuing visas to people with links to organised crime despite warnings from New Delhi. Jaishankar said some people in Canada, with 'pro-Pakistan leanings', have organised themselves politically and taken the shape of an influential political lobby. He said he saw reports that three people have been arrested, and, the Canadian police have conducted 'some investigation'.\n\nNijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Surrey RCMP received a report of a shooting at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey. First responding members located a man, later identified as Hardeep Singh Nijjar, suffering from fatal gunshot wounds inside a vehicle.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) has been carrying out the investigation. It has continued to work closely with a number of partner agencies and support services across Canada, as far east as Ontario, including the Surrey RCMP, the Alberta RCMP and other Lower Mainland Integrated Teams.\n\nNijjar's killing triggered diplomatic tensions between Canada and India after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of being involved in the killing -- a claim that India has rejected as \"absurd.\"\n\nThe video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March this year showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a \"contract killing\".\n\nThis report is auto-generated from a syndicated feed\n\nComments", "source": {"uri": "indiandefensenews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "indiandefensenews.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Centennial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Centennial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ontario_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Ontario Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

None are believed to have pursued education during their time in Canada or obtained permanent residency.\n\nAll are alleged associates of a criminal group in Punjab and neighbouring Haryana state that is associated with notorious Punjabi gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, currently held in India's high-security Sabarmati prison in Ahmedabad, in Gujarat, according to sources close to the investigation.\n\nHardeep Nijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen, was shot dead on June 18, shortly after evening prayers at his Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, BC, in what appeared to be a highly coordinated attack, according to video of the incident obtained by CBC's The Fifth Estate programme.\n\nThe Fifth Estate shows how the killing of a Sikh Canadian activist was carried out, allegedly by agents of the government of India. That programme has been banned on YouTube in India.\n\nCanadian officials have told representatives of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in person that Canada had intelligence linking it to Nijjar's killing.\n\nOn September 18, 2023, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rose in the House of Commons to state that \"Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India\" and Nijjar's killing.\n\n\"Any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty,\" he added.\n\nPM Trudeau said any foreign government involvement in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is \"an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty\".\n\nDuring a roundtable with Canadian Punjabi media on Sunday, Trudeau said the work by intelligence and police agencies was ongoing.\n\n\"It is very good and rigorous work. And when the time comes for them to conclude that investigation, there will be some very, very clear things that everyone around the world, including in India, will see as to responsibilities and involvement,\" he said.\n\nAccording to both an unsealed US federal indictment and Canadian investigators, the Indian government itself took advantage of criminal networks to go after its enemies in Canada and the US: Hardeep Nijjar and Khalistani activist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.\n\nCanadian and US sources have said both Hardeep Singh Nijjar and Pannun were targeted for their role in organising the Khalistan Referendum voting, attended by tens of thousands of Sikhs.\n\nNijjar was the chief coordinator of the Khalistan Referendum campaign in Canada and a close associate of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. Nijjar, Pannun, UK-based Paramjeet Singh Pamma and others had been designated terrorists by the Indian government in 2020.\n\nMoreover, Nijjar was also the president of Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in British Columbia -- Canada's biggest Gurdawara.\n\nThe Khalistan Referendum voting campaign is being organised under the supervision of the independent Punjab Referendum Commission (PRC), which will announce the results when all phases are completed.\n\nThe voting started on October 31, 2021, from London, UK and has so far been held in several cities across the UK, Geneva Switzerland, Rome and Milan (Italy), Australian cities of Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney; and Canadian cities of Brampton, Mississauga, Malton (Ontario), Vancouver (British Columbia) and two states in the USA.\n\nThe next phase of the referendum is planned for Calgary in Canada at the end of June.", "source": {"uri": "geo.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "GEO TV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On June 18, 2023, he was shot dead by masked assailants in the car park of the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver.\n\nNijjar's killing sent diplomatic relations between Ottawa and New Delhi into a tailspin last year after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were \"credible allegations\" linking Indian intelligence to the crime.\n\nIndia rejected the allegations as \"absurd\", temporarily halting the processing of visas and forcing Canada to reduce its diplomatic presence in the country significantly.\n\n\"It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India,\" the Press Trust of India news agency quoted India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar as saying on Saturday.\n\nNew Delhi has sought to persuade Ottawa not to grant Sikh separatists visas or political legitimacy, Jaishankar said, since they are \"causing problems for them [Canada], for us and also for our relationship\".\n\nHe added that Canada does not \"share any evidence with us in certain cases, [and] police agencies also do not cooperate with us\".\n\nJaishankar said India will wait for the Canadian police to share information on the arrested men, adding that the suspects \"apparently are Indians of some kind of gang background\".\n\n\"We'll have to wait for the police to tell us,\" he said. \"But, as I said, one of our concerns which we have been telling them is that, you know, they have allowed organised crime from India, specifically from Punjab, to operate in Canada.\"\n\nThe three Indian nationals, all in their 20s, were arrested in Edmonton, the capital of Alberta province, on first-degree murder and conspiracy charges. They were accused of being the attacker, driver and lookout in his killing last June. The Canadian police said they were aware that \"others may have played a role\" in the murder.\n\nMeanwhile, Trudeau, speaking on Saturday at an event in Toronto to celebrate Sikh heritage and culture, acknowledged that many Sikhs in Canada are \"feeling uneasy, and perhaps even frightened right now\", but urged faith in the justice system.\n\n\"Let us remain calm and remain steadfast in our commitment to our democratic principles and our system of justice,\" he said.\n\nTrudeau said the arrests were \"important because Canada is a rule of law country with a strong and independent justice system, as well as a fundamental commitment to protecting all its citizens\".\n\nNijjar advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India. Thousands of people were killed in the 1980s during the separatist movement, which was put down by the Indian security forces. The movement has largely petered out within India, but in the Sikh diaspora - whose largest community is in Canada, with about 770,000 people - it retains support among a vocal minority.\n\nIndia has warned governments in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom repeatedly that Sikh separatists were trying to make a comeback.\n\nIn November, the US Department of Justice charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on US soil.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.

Mandeep Mooker said in a Surrey, B.C., news conference on Friday that the three men had been arrested in Edmonton that morning, and there may be more suspects and arrests as the investigation progresses.\n\n\"We are investigating if there are any ties to the government of India,\" Mooker said. \"However ... it's an ongoing investigation, and I don't have any information to provide on that matter at this time.\"\n\nNijjar was shot and killed in his pickup truck last June as he left the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, touching off a wave of protests and rallies from local communities against diplomats from India.\n\nHe was the president of the gurdwara. Nijjar also campaigned for a separate Sikh homeland in India -- also known as Khalistan -- and organized unofficial referendums around the world about Punjabi independence.\n\nB.C.

How do we go back into our community and have this conversation around is this safe or is it not safe?\"\n\nTrudeau said in September that there was credible intelligence linking Nijjar's killing to the Indian government, touching off a diplomatic row that resulted in India suspending issuing visas to Canadians for two months.\n\nIndia has repeatedly denied involvement in Nijjar's death.\n\nRCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said police in Canada have been trying to collaborate with Indian authorities on investigations such as the Nijjar case, an effort that began before his killing.\n\n\"I'll be frank, I'll characterize that collaboration as rather challenging and difficult for the last several years,\" Teboul said. \"However, the RCMP is very committed to continuing to establish a working relationship from law enforcement to law enforcement agency. So we're going to continue our efforts.\n\n\"But it's been difficult.\"\n\nPolice say the three suspects arrested in Nijjar's killing -- Karan Brar, Karanpreet Singh and Kamalpreet Singh -- are all male Indian nationals in their 20s living in Edmonton.\n\nMooker said the men have been in Canada for three to five years as non-permanent residents but provided no other details on their immigration status.\n\nPolice say the three suspects are expected to be transported to B.C. by Monday to face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun is a New-York-based Sikh independence activist who U.S. prosecutors say was a target in an assassination plot directed by an Indian government official.\n\nHe said the arrests were \"a step forward\" but \"only scratch the surface.\"\n\n\"Shaheed Nijjar was my dear personal friend and close associate,\" Pannun said in a statement, using an honorific implying martyrdom. \"He was an upright individual, a peaceful man with demonstrated commitment to community service.\n\n\"Canadian politicians of every stripe must stand with the Canadian Sikhs' right to peacefully advocate for Khalistan without facing any violent retaliation from the Indian government.\"\n\nFederal Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said in Ottawa that he understands that members of the Indo-Canadian community and others \"may still have questions or concerns,\" and asked that they \"put their trust in the justice system.\"\n\n\"Every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free of threats of violence,\" LeBlanc said without taking questions, adding that his department will engage with community groups in the coming days.\n\n\"We want to hear their concerns and work with them to foster trust and open communications.\"\n\nIn a statement, the federal Opposition Conservatives said while they are glad arrests were made, the party wished the Canadian government could have foiled the killing of Nijjar \"as was the case in the United States,\" a reference to the alleged assassination plot there.\n\nB.C. Premier David Eby said Nijjar's killing had \"shaken the Sikh community in British Columbia, the larger South Asian community, and Canadians across the country.\"\n\n\"I hope that today's announcement of charges against three individuals is an important step towards justice for his family and accountability to the whole community,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe World Sikh Organization of Canada said it welcomed the news of the arrest of three members of an \"alleged hit squad that assassinated\" Nijjar.\n\nBut the group said in a statement that it believes the arrests raise disturbing questions about the connection between India's government and criminal gangs.\n\nIt noted that the report by the Foreign Interference Commission says India uses proxies in Canada who work with intelligence officials in Indian and Canada.\n\nAn interim report into foreign interference released Friday in Ottawa said Indian officials engaged in a range of activities to influence Canada's communities and politicians.\n\nIt says India's interests in Canada related to the large South Asian community in the country.\n\n\"India does not differentiate between lawful, pro-Khalistani political advocacy and the relatively small Canada-based Khalistani violent extremism,\" the report says.\n\nIndian officials in Canada have increasingly relied on Canadian proxies and contacts in its network to conduct foreign interference, the report says.\n\n\"It views anyone aligned with Khalistani separatism as a seditious threat to India. Targets of Indian foreign interference are often members of the Indo-Canadian communities, but prominent non-Indo-Canadians are also subject to India's foreign influence activities.\"", "source":

India has repeatedly denied the allegations, terming them \"absurd and motivated.\"\n\nGiving an address at the Sikh Foundation of Canada's Centennial Gala event held at the Royal Ontario Museum on Sunday, Trudeau began by acknowledging the arrests made in connection to the case, emphasising that the investigation remains ongoing.\n\n\"I need to begin, somewhat awkwardly perhaps, but importantly, to acknowledge the arrests that were made in relation to the murder of Nijjar. As the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) stated, the investigation remains ongoing, as does a separate and distinct investigation, not limited to the involvement of the three people arrested yesterday,\" he said.\n\nHe highlighted Canada's status as a rule-of-law country with a robust and independent justice system. \"This is important because Canada is a rule-of-law country with a strong and independent justice system, as well as a fundamental commitment to protecting all its citizens. I know that many Canadians, particularly members of the Sikh community, are feeling uneasy and perhaps even frightened right now,\" Trudeau added.\n\nTrudeau also reassured that every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free from discrimination and violence. He urged them to \"remain calm... remain steadfast in our commitment to our democratic principles and our system of justice. This is who we are and what we do as Canadians\".\n\nA day ago, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Canada has been issuing visas to people with links to organised crime despite warnings from New Delhi. Jaishankar said some people in Canada, with 'pro-Pakistan leanings', have organised themselves politically and taken the shape of an influential political lobby. He said he saw reports that three people have been arrested, and, the Canadian police have conducted 'some investigation'.\n\nNijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Surrey RCMP received a report of a shooting at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey. First responding members located a man, later identified as Hardeep Singh Nijjar, suffering from fatal gunshot wounds inside a vehicle.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) has been carrying out the investigation. It has continued to work closely with a number of partner agencies and support services across Canada, as far east as Ontario, including the Surrey RCMP, the Alberta RCMP and other Lower Mainland Integrated Teams.\n\nNijjar's killing triggered diplomatic tensions between Canada and India after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of being involved in the killing -- a claim that India has rejected as \"absurd.\"\n\nThe video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March this year showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a \"contract killing\".

His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n\"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-'Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n\"It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,\" Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.

He was a Canadian citizen who was advocating for the establishment of a separate Sikh homeland to be formed from India.Canadian police on Friday reportedly charged three Indian nationals linked to the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in the province of British Columbia in June 2023.\n\nThe following is a timeline of important events that led to the arrests in a murder case that has strained relations between Canada and India.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, 45-year-old Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, which is a Vancouver suburb known for its large Sikh population. He was a Canadian citizen who was advocating for the establishment of a separate Sikh homeland to be formed from India.\n\nOn September 1, 2023, a Canadian trade official mentioned that Canada halted discussions regarding a proposed trade agreement with India. This decision was unexpected and occurred approximately three months after both nations expressed their intention to finalise an initial deal within the year.\n\nOn September 10, 2023, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed serious worries regarding Sikh separatist demonstrations in Canada to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during a G20 summit in New Delhi.\n\nTrudeau told parliament on Sept. 18, 2023 that Canada was \"actively pursuing credible allegations' linking Indian government agents to the killing of Nijjar.\n\nIndia dismissed Trudeau's assertion as \"absurd\" on Sept. 19, 2023. Both countries expel a diplomat in retaliatory actions, where Canada expels India's top intelligence officer while India expels the Canadian counterpart.\n\nOn September 22, 2023, India suspended the issuance of new visas for Canadians and requests Ottawa to decrease its diplomatic representation in India. India start issuing visas again after a two-month period.\n\nOn October 29, 2023, tens of thousands of Sikhs gather in Surrey, British Columbia, at the gurdwara where Nijjar was killed to participate in an unofficial referendum regarding the establishment of an independent Sikh state.\n\nOn Nov 21, 2023: India's anti-terror agency files a case against Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist, stating that he warned Air India passengers in video messages shared on social media that their lives were in danger.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, a senior official from the Biden administration stated that U.S. authorities had foiled a plot to assassinate Pannun within the United States and had cautioned India due to suspicions of the involvement of the government in New Delhi.\n\nIndia's High Commissioner on Feb. 5, 2024, said in an interview with Canada's Globe & Mail newspaper that India will not provide information to Canadian investigators over Nijjar's murder until Canada shares evidence.\n\nOn April 30, 2024, the White House considers a Washington Post report serious. The report suggests that an officer from India's intelligence service played a direct role in the killing of Nijjar and the failed attempt to kill Pannun in the United States.\n\nIndia's foreign ministry said the report contained \"unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations.\"\n\nWith inputs from Reuters", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He migrated to Canada in 1997 and acquired citizenship 18 years later.\n\nHe was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder, the allegations he had denied. On June 18, 2023, he was shot dead by masked assailants in the car park of the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver.\n\nNijjar's killing sent diplomatic relations between Ottawa and New Delhi into a tailspin last year after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were \"credible allegations\" linking Indian intelligence to the crime.\n\nIndia rejected the allegations as \"absurd\", temporarily halting the processing of visas and forcing Canada to reduce its diplomatic presence in the country significantly.\n\n\"It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India,\" the Press Trust of India news agency quoted India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar as saying on Saturday.\n\nNew Delhi has sought to persuade Ottawa not to grant Sikh separatists visas or political legitimacy, Jaishankar said, since they are \"causing problems for them [Canada], for us and also for our relationship\".\n\nHe added that Canada does not \"share any evidence with us in certain cases, [and] police agencies also do not cooperate with us\".\n\nJaishankar said India will wait for the Canadian police to share information on the arrested men, adding that the suspects \"apparently are Indians of some kind of gang background\".\n\n\"We'll have to wait for the police to tell us,\" he said. \"But, as I said, one of our concerns which we have been telling them is that, you know, they have allowed organised crime from India, specifically from Punjab, to operate in Canada.\"\n\nThe three Indian nationals, all in their 20s, were arrested in Edmonton, the capital of Alberta province, on first-degree murder and conspiracy charges. They were accused of being the attacker, driver and lookout in his killing last June. The Canadian police said they were aware that \"others may have played a role\" in the murder.\n\nMeanwhile, Trudeau, speaking on Saturday at an event in Toronto to celebrate Sikh heritage and culture, acknowledged that many Sikhs in Canada are \"feeling uneasy, and perhaps even frightened right now\", but urged faith in the justice system.\n\n\"Let us remain calm and remain steadfast in our commitment to our democratic principles and our system of justice,\" he said.\n\nTrudeau said the arrests were \"important because Canada is a rule of law country with a strong and independent justice system, as well as a fundamental commitment to protecting all its citizens\".\n\nNijjar advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India. Thousands of people were killed in the 1980s during the separatist movement, which was put down by the Indian security forces. The movement has largely petered out within India, but in the Sikh diaspora - whose largest community is in Canada, with about 770,000 people - it retains support among a vocal minority.\n\nIndia has warned governments in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom repeatedly that Sikh separatists were trying to make a comeback.\n\nIn November, the US Department of Justice charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on US soil.\n\nA Washington Post investigation found last week that Indian foreign intelligence officials were involved in the plot, a claim rejected by New Delhi.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Assistant Commissioner David Teboul announced the arrest of three individuals charged in the murder of Sikh activist Nijjar.\n\nDuring a press briefing, Teboul stated that ongoing investigations into potential connections with the Indian government, underscoring the murder's active probe.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" he was quoted as saying by the CTV News channel.\n\nSuperintendent Mandeep Mooker, leading the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team, noted that the suspects were previously unknown to law enforcement. Identifying them as Karan Brar, Karanpreet Singh, and Kamalpreet Singh, all in their twenties, Mooker revealed their arrest in Edmonton.\n\nAll three persons, identified as Indian nationals, have resided in Canada as non-permanent residents for three to five years, Mooker added.\n\nCoordination with Indian authorities has posed challenges in recent years, according to Mooker, who credited the Sikh community for crucial information aiding the investigation.\n\n\"We would not be at this point without the bravery and courage of the Sikh community coming forward with information for this investigation,\" he said, adding that he believes they will continue to come forward for any future investigations, according to the report.\n\nThe suspects face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in Nijjar's death, court documents confirm.\n\nNijjar, a Canadian citizen, was shot outside his gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18, 2023.\n\nReports suggest the suspects entered Canada on student visas but may have been operating under Indian intelligence directives during the assassination. Karan Brar faces additional charges related to a separate murder in Surrey and a conspiracy to murder in Edmonton and Surrey.\n\n\"Student visas but may have been working at the direction of Indian intelligence when they shot Nijjar.\" According to court records, Brar has been charged with a murder that occurred in Surrey on June 18, 2023. He also faces a charge of conspiracy to murder on May 1, 2023, in Edmonton and Surrey, a report by Global News said.\n\nCanadian Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc refrained from confirming links to the Indian government, deferring such inquiries to the RCMP.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc said, as reported by PTI.\n\n\"I think the police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added.\n\nThe indictments allege a conspiracy spanning Surrey and Edmonton from May 1, 2023, until Nijjar's killing.\n\nCBC reports police are actively probing potential ties to three additional Canadian murders, including the death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nAlleged hit squad members assumed various roles during Nijjar's assassination, acting as shooters, drivers, and spotters, according to sources.\n\nIndia rebuffed Trudeau's recent comments on Nijjar's killing, asserting the remarks perpetuate separatism and extremism in Canada.\n\n\"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n\"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nEarlier on Monday, India had also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-Khalistan slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. \"It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,\" Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.", "source": {"uri":

They are also charged on a second count for using a firearm \"on or about June 18, 2023... to commit first-degree murder.\"\n\nAll three suspects are Indian nationals, police said in a press briefing on Wednesday.

Anyone who may have seen these individuals, in or around Surrey, in the weeks leading up to the homicide, or anyone with information about the homicide is asked to contact IHIT.\n\nHe said that the suspects \"were not known to the police\" before the investigation into Nijjar's death, according to reports.\n\nMooker said all three are Indian nationals and have been living as non-permanent residents in Canada for the last three to five years.\n\nHe said coordination with India has been \"challenging and rather difficult for the last several years\".\n\nMooker said that his investigation has relied on the Sikh community's support.\n\n\"We would not be at this point without the bravery and courage of the Sikh community coming forward with information for this investigation,\" he said, adding that he believes they will continue to come forward for any future investigations, according to the report.\n\nCiting sources, a report in Global News said that the suspects had entered Canada on \"student visas but may have been working at the direction of Indian intelligence when they shot Nijjar.\" According to court records, Brar has been charged with a murder that occurred in Surrey on June 18, 2023. He also faces a charge of conspiracy to murder on May 1, 2023, in Edmonton and Surrey, the report said.\n\nTalking to reporters, Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc declined to confirm the Indian government connection, saying such questions are best addressed by the RCMP.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc said.\n\n\"I think the police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added.\n\nThe indictments Friday allege the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023, and the date of Nijjar's killing.\n\nQuoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, according to the sources.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nIndia on Monday summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-Khalistan slogans at the event in the presence of Prime Minister Trudeau and several other leaders.\n\nNijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended the issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.

His day job was working as a plumber.\n\nFor years, the Indian government called him a terrorist -- a claim Nijjar repeatedly denied.\n\nOne source close to the investigation told CBC News Canada is seeing foreign governments, including India, make use of criminal elements to carry out international operations.\n\n\"Why risk sending Indian government people when you can get so much mileage using

Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar | RCI", "body": "Canadian police have arrested members of an alleged hit squad investigators believe was tasked by the government of India with killing prominent Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, B.C. last June, CBC News has learned.\n\nSources close to the investigation also told CBC News that police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, according to the sources.\n\nThe men were arrested Friday during police operations in at least two provinces. Sources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nKamalpreet Singh, Karanpreet Singh and Karan Brar face first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the Nijjar case, according to documents filed in a Surrey court Friday. The charges have not been tested in court.\n\nPolice are expected to share some details of their investigation later Friday.\n\nCBC News learned of the arrests -- as well as other information that may not be announced by police on Friday -- through extensive discussions with senior investigative and government sources, as well as members of the Sikh community.\n\nThe investigative and government sources spoke with CBC News on the condition that they not be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The sources in the Sikh community expressed concerns about their personal security, so CBC News is not disclosing their identities.\n\nNijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen, was shot dead on June 18, shortly after evening prayers at his Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara (new window) in Surrey, B.C., in what appeared to be a highly coordinated attack, according to video of the incident (new window) obtained by CBC's The Fifth Estate.\n\nWATCH | The Fifth Estate shows how the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar was carried out\n\nThe Fifth Estate shows how the killing of a Sikh Canadian activist was carried out, allegedly by agents of the government of India.\n\nLast August, Canadian officials told representatives of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in person that Canada had intelligence linking it to Nijjar's killing.\n\nA month later -- on Sept. 18, 2023, not long after returning from a fraught visit to India (new window) for the G20 Summit -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rose in the House of Commons to state that Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India and Nijjar's killing.\n\nAny involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty, he added.\n\nModi's government has denied it ordered extrajudicial killings in the U.S. and Canada. Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar initially decried the Canadian allegation as absurd and accused Canada of harbouring violent extremists.\n\nWATCH | Trudeau links Indian government to fatal shooting in Canada\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau says any foreign government involvement in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is 'an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty.'\n\nThe minister's tone at a Sept. 27, 2023 speaking event was somewhat less confrontational (new window). Jaishankar said at that time that we told the Canadians that this is not the government of India's policy.\n\nIn December, after a U.S. indictment accused an unnamed Indian government employee of playing a role in a murder-for-hire plot in the U.S., Jaishankar issued another statement (new window).\n\nWe have always maintained that if any country, not just Canada, has a concern and gives us some input or some basis for that concern, we are always open to look at it, he said.\n\nBloomberg reported in March that the Indian government had given the U.S. a report in which it acknowledged that Indian agents were involved in the U.S. murder plot, but claimed they were rogue operatives. (new window)\n\nAt this stage of Canada's investigation, investigators are unlikely to expand on any possible connections between Nijjar's alleged killers and Indian government officials.\n\nHowever, during a roundtable (new window) with Canadian Punjabi media on Sunday, Trudeau said the work by intelligence and police agencies was ongoing.\n\nIt is very good and rigorous work. And when the time comes for them to conclude that investigation, there will be some very, very clear things that everyone around the world, including in India, will see as to responsibilities and involvement, he said.\n\nJust two days after Trudeau's bombshell statement in the House -- on Sept. 20, 2023 -- Sukhdool Singh Gill, 39, of Winnipeg was found shot to death in a duplex in the city's northwest. A neighbour told police he heard 11 shots.\n\nGill also went by the alias Sukha Duneke and allegedly was part of the Davinder Bambiha gang in India, according to police documents in that country. Indian media have reported that he fled to Canada in 2017 using a false passport.\n\nGill was one of Punjab's most wanted men, accused of extortion and arranging money for gang members to buy weapons. Police in India have publicly linked him to murders and other serious crimes.\n\nHe was also on the radar of the government of India.\n\nOne day before his killing, Gill's name and photo appeared on a list of 43 names of suspected terrorists drawn up by India's National Investigation Agency (NIA) (new window), which linked him to the separatist Khalistan Tiger Force. India previously accused Nijjar of being part of the same organization.\n\nThe day after Gill died, the NIA tweeted an image (new window) of him along with other wanted men.\n\nSix weeks after Gill's death, another alleged Indian gangland figure in another western province was shot dead in a brazen daylight attack that also claimed the life of his 11-year-old son.\n\nHarpreet Uppal, a 41-year-old with links to organized crime, was shot dead in his vehicle in a busy suburban shopping area of Edmonton on Nov. 9, 2023. Two boys were in the vehicle, Uppal's 11-year-old son, Gavin, and a friend.\n\nThe Edmonton Police Service later said the killers shot both father and son, while sparing the other boy. EPS Acting Superintendent Colin Derkson said Gavin was not caught in a crossfire or killed by mistake.\n\nNo one has been charged in the Gill or Uppal killings, and the sources told CBC News charges in connection to these cases are not expected to come Friday.\n\nThe sources told CBC News the men arrested Friday in relation to Nijjar's killing are Indian citizens who arrived in Canada on temporary visas after 2021, some of them student visas. None are believed to have pursued education while in Canada. None have obtained permanent residency.\n\nAll are alleged associates of a criminal group in Punjab and neighboring Haryana state that is associated with notorious Punjabi gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, currently held in India's high-security Sabarmati prison in Ahmedabad, in Gujarat, according to sources close to the investigation.\n\nBishnoi is accused by the Indian government of the shooting murder of Punjabi singer-politician Sidhu Moose Wala, a former resident of Brampton, Ont., in Punjab in May 2022, as well as drug smuggling and extortion.\n\nBishnoi was one of two jailed Indian gangsters who claimed responsibility on social media for Gill's killing last September, describing it as revenge for a previous gangland killing in India, according to widespread Indian media reports.\n\nIndia has long alleged that Punjabi gangsters are able to use Canada as a base to squeeze money from business owners and others in India, relying on an army of low-paid gunmen to act as collectors and enforcers back home.\n\nAccording to both an unsealed U.S. federal indictment and Canadian investigators, the Indian government itself took advantage of those criminal networks to go after its enemies in Canada and the U.S. -- enemies such as Nijjar and Khalistani activist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, reportedly the target of an unsuccessful assassination plot in the U.S. (new window)\n\nWATCH | U.S. indictment reveals alleged murder-for-hire plot linked to India\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar was a pro-Khalistan activist and the president of a Sikh temple in Surrey, B.C. His day job was working as a plumber. For years, the Indian government called him a terrorist -- a claim Nijjar repeatedly denied. So, who was Nijjar, and why did India think he was such a danger?\n\nPannun was the key organizer behind a series of independence votes in the Sikh diaspora. While the votes had no legal effect, they reportedly infuriated the Modi government.\n\nNijjar was targeted by India because of his role in helping to organize the votes in Canada's Sikh community, according to Canadian sources and the U.S. indictment.\n\nOne source close to the investigation told CBC News Canada is seeing foreign governments, including India, make use of criminal elements to carry out international operations.\n\nWhy risk sending Indian government people when you can get so much mileage using people from organized crime? the investigator said.\n\nBut while the investigation is probing possible connections between Nijjar's killing and the Gill and Uppal cases, investigators are not convinced the Indian government was involved in the latter two.\n\nInvestigators say the Edmonton and Winnipeg killings may have had more to do with gangland rivalries and vendettas.\n\nThe U.S. indictment (new window) alleges an Indian government employee contracted a criminal to target enemies in North America.\n\nOn June 30, 2023, Czech authorities acting on a U.S. warrant arrested alleged Indian drug trafficker Nikhil Nick Gupta. On Nov. 30 he was indicted in the U.S. for allegedly helping an unnamed Indian government official hire a hitman to kill an unnamed Sikh independence activist in New York, reported to be Pannun, widely considered India's number one target.\n\nIt was the Drug Enforcement Administration, rather than the FBI, that stumbled onto the U.S.-based conspiracy while investigating Gupta in a narcotics case.\n\nGupta didn't know that the contact he asked to help him find a hitman was in fact a confidential informant of the DEA, the U.S. indictment alleges. Gupta has denied the charges and is facing extradition to the United States. He has not been tried.\n\nThe U.S. indictment also referred to Canadian cases. It alleged the unnamed Indian government employee told Gupta the Nijjar killing had accelerated the timetable for the assassination in New York -- It's [a] priority now, he allegedly texted.\n\nGupta allegedly sent his supposed contract killer a video of Nijjar's body and told him to do it quickly.\n\nThe U.S. indictment says Gupta told the police informant in an audio call that they had four jobs to finish before June 29 -- one in New York and three in Canada.\n\nThe publication of court documents in his case was one of a number of incidents that concerned Canadian investigators, who watched closely to see what effect the revelations might have on their own surveillance targets in Canada.\n\nWhile the prime minister and U.S. authorities have pointed the finger at the Indian government, Canadian investigators have struggled with the question of how high up the Indian chain of command they should pursue charges.\n\nInvestigators long ago dismissed the notion that India's overseas assassination campaign is a rogue operation, as the Indian government has maintained.\n\nThey say they believe that Indian officials would not dare to proceed with assassinations in Western countries without official sanction. As CBC News has previously reported, Canadian government sources say Canada has evidence of communications (new window) between Indian government officials in India and Canada collected in the course of their investigation.\n\nThe arrests come as Indians go to the polls in a national election that takes several weeks of voting to produce a result, expected on June 4.

So, they have tried to create space for themselves in the politics of these countries. I mean, at this time, it's not so much a problem in the US.\"\n\n\"Our biggest problem right now is in Canada. Because in Canada, actually, today the party in power in Canada, and other parties in Canada have given these kinds of extremism, separatism, and advocates of violence a certain legitimacy in the name of free speech. See, when you tell them something, their answer is no no we are a democratic country but it is free speech. The point that they need to understand, it is no longer a world that runs as a one-way street. If there are that which happen out there, there will be pushback. Newton's law of politics will apply there also. There will be a reaction. Others will take steps or counter it,\" he added.\n\nHe said he saw reports that three people have been arrested, and, the Canadian police have conducted 'some investigation'.\n\nAbout Hardeep Singh Nijjar's Death\n\nNijjar was shot and killed after he had stepped out of a gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A video clip of his killing reportedly surfaced in March this year, purportedly showing Nijjar being fatally shot by assailants, in what was claimed to be 'contract killing'.\n\nJaishankar said Canada has been welcoming people from India with links to organised crime, ignoring warnings by New Delhi.\n\n\"Often, when I see for example these kinds of attacks, threats to our embassies, because they concern me very deeply and I tell the foreign minister, suppose if (they) happened to you, if it was your embassy, your diplomat, your flag, how would you react. We have to keep our position strong on this particular report which has come. I also saw it yesterday night, I was coming to Odisha in the morning, somebody may have been arrested, their police may have done some investigation,\" Jaishankar said at the event.\n\n\"But, the fact is that a number of gangland people, a number of people with organised crime links from Punjab have been made welcome in Canada. We have been telling Canada saying look these are wanted criminals from India, you have given them visas. Many of them have come in false documentation and yet you allow them to live there. If you decide to import for political purposes people with very dubious, actually, very negative backgrounds, there will be issues, they have in some cases created problems in their own country as a result of their own policies. No, why would we fear, if something happens there, it is for them to worry about,\" he added.\n\nJagmeet Singh Alleges Involvement Of An Indian In The Killing Of Nijjar\n\nOn May 4, Canada's New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh levelled a fresh allegation of an India hand in the killing of Nijjar. However, the Canadian police administration did not share any evidence suggesting India's involvement in the killing of the Khaliatani leader.\n\nJagmeet's party backs the Liberal minority government led by Trudeau in exchange for support on some key bills.\n\nAfter the Canadian Police announced the arrest of three alleged accused in the killing of Hardep Nijjar, Jagmeet renewed his claim of an Indian hand in the incident.\n\n\"The Indian government hired assassins to murder a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil - at a place of worship. Today 3 arrests were made. Let me be clear - any Indian agent or state actor that ordered, planned or carried out this murder must be exposed and met with the full force of Canadian law. For Canada, democracy and free speech - there must be Justice for Hardeep Singh Nijjar,\" Jagmeet posted from his X handle.\n\nIn 2023, the Canadian PM alleged an Indian hand in the killing, a claim that was vehemently denied by India which called it 'absurd and motivated'. The Canadian Police have also not given any evidence linking India to the killing.\n\nPhotographs Of 3 Indians Released By Canadian Police\n\nEarlier, on Friday, Canadian police released photographs of all three persons arrested in the killing of India-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year amid an ongoing probe into alleged connections of the Indian government.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in a statement named the three men, all Indian nationals, as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22 and released their photographs. The trio were arrested in Edmonton City in Alberta.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of Surrey, RCMP on Friday (local time) said that on the morning of May 3, IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta RCMP and the Edmonton Police Service, arrested the three men for the June 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey.\n\nThe trio have now been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the homicide, according to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police press release. Along with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police have also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of the evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of the murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nIndia and Canada are dealing with an unprecedented diplomatic crisis, after the Canadian Prime Minister accused agents of the Indian government of killing Canadian Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023. However, India has dismissed the accusations as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\"", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagmeet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jagmeet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaishankar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaishankar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

The video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March this year showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a \"contract killing.\"\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardeep_Singh_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hardeep Singh (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagmeet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jagmeet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Police_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Police Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Investigation_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Investigation Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/in7fkl/article68138658.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-04-16T220746Z_927190942_RC2T77AG032U_RTRMADP_3_CANADA-BUDGET.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1972, "textEnd": 1977}], "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

So, they have tried to create space for themselves in the politics of these countries. I mean, at this time, it's not so much a problem in the US.\"\n\n\"Our biggest problem right now is in Canada. Because in Canada, actually, today the party in power in Canada, and other parties in Canada have given these kinds of extremism, separatism, and advocates of violence a certain legitimacy in the name of free speech. See, when you tell them something, their answer is no no we are a democratic country but it is free speech. The point that they need to understand, it is no longer a world that runs as a one-way street. If there are that which happen out there, there will be pushback. Newton's law of politics will apply there also. There will be a reaction. Others will take steps or counter it,\" he added.\n\nHe said he saw reports that three people have been arrested, and, the Canadian police have conducted 'some investigation'.\n\nNijjar was shot and killed after he had stepped out of a gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A video clip of his killing reportedly surfaced in March this year, purportedly showing Nijjar being fatally shot by assailants, in what was claimed to be 'contract killing'.\n\nJaishankar said Canada has been welcoming people from India with links to organised crime, ignoring warnings by New Delhi.\n\n\"Often, when I see for example these kinds of attacks, threats to our embassies, because they concern me very deeply and I tell the foreign minister, suppose if (they) happened to you, if it was your embassy, your diplomat, your flag, how would you react. We have to keep our position strong on this particular report which has come. I also saw it yesterday night, I was coming to Odisha in the morning, somebody may have been arrested, their police may have done some investigation,\" Jaishankar said at the event.\n\n\"But, the fact is that a number of gangland people, a number of people with organised crime links from Punjab have been made welcome in Canada. We have been telling Canada saying look these are wanted criminals from India, you have given them visas. Many of them have come in false documentation and yet you allow them to live there. If you decide to import for political purposes people with very dubious, actually, very negative backgrounds, there will be issues, they have in some cases created problems in their own country as a result of their own policies. No, why would we fear, if something happens there, it is for them to worry about,\" he added.\n\nOn May 4, Canada's New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh levelled a fresh allegation of an India hand in the killing of Nijjar. However, the Canadian police administration did not share any evidence suggesting India's involvement in the killing of the Khaliatani leader.\n\nJagmeet's party backs the Liberal minority government led by Trudeau in exchange for support on some key bills.\n\nAfter the Canadian Police announced the arrest of three alleged accused in the killing of Hardep Nijjar, Jagmeet renewed his claim of an Indian hand in the incident.\n\n\"The Indian government hired assassins to murder a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil - at a place of worship. Today 3 arrests were made. Let me be clear - any Indian agent or state actor that ordered, planned or carried out this murder must be exposed and met with the full force of Canadian law. For Canada, democracy and free speech - there must be Justice for Hardeep Singh Nijjar,\" Jagmeet posted from his X handle.\n\nIn 2023, the Canadian PM alleged an Indian hand in the killing, a claim that was vehemently denied by India which called it 'absurd and motivated'. The Canadian Police have also not given any evidence linking India to the killing.\n\nEarlier, on Friday, Canadian police released photographs of all three persons arrested in the killing of India-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year amid an ongoing probe into alleged connections of the Indian government.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in a statement named the three men, all Indian nationals, as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22 and released their photographs. The trio were arrested in Edmonton City in Alberta.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of Surrey, RCMP on Friday (local time) said that on the morning of May 3, IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta RCMP and the Edmonton Police Service, arrested the three men for the June 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey.\n\nThe trio have now been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the homicide, according to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police press release. Along with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police have also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of the evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of the murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nIndia and Canada are dealing with an unprecedented diplomatic crisis, after the Canadian Prime Minister accused agents of the Indian government of killing Canadian Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023. However, India has dismissed the accusations as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" (ANI)", "source": {"uri": "aninews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asian News International (ANI)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagmeet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jagmeet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaishankar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaishankar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

Police said the men were Indian citizens living in Edmonton: Karan Brar and Kamalpreet Singh, both 22, and Karanpreet Singh, 28. They have each been charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nThe men -- all non-permanent residents of Canada who have been in the country for three to five years -- were taken into custody in Edmonton. Authorities are probing a connection between the killing of Nijjar and the government of India, but police did not provide many details on the alleged link on Friday.\n\nIn September, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly described \"credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India\" and the killing, sparking a row between the two countries. India has denied having a role and expelled Canadian diplomats.\n\nTrudeau and other Canadian officials have largely gone silent about the killing since then, saying they would wait for Canada's police and justice system to investigate the matter.\n\nA few months after Trudeau's accusation, United States court documents revealed American authorities had thwarted an alleged assassination attempt against a Sikh activist in New York and were seeking to extradite the suspect from the Czech Republic.\n\nProsecutors in that case allege the hitman was recruited by an agent who was \"employed at all times relevant to this Indictment by the Indian government, resides in India, and directed the assassination plot from India.\" Last week the Washington Post reported American officials believe the operation was approved by senior-level members of India's intelligence agency, including its chief at the time.\n\nNijjar was a prominent voice in a movement to carve out a separate state in India for Sikhs called Khalistan, which the Indian government deems a terrorist threat.\n\nDanish Singh, president of the World Sikh Organization of Canada, said in a statement that he welcomes the reported arrests but believes they \"raise disturbing questions about the nexus between the Government of India and criminal gangs.\"", "source": {"uri": "bangkokpost.com", "dataType":

Hardeep Singh Nijjar was named in the event.\n\nIndia has consistently expressed concerns regarding the space given to separatists, terrorists, and anti-India elements in Canada, considering it a core issue in bilateral relations.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's accusations last year, India temporarily halted the issuance of visas to Canadian citizens.

Today 3 arrests were made. Let me be clear - any Indian agent or state actor that ordered, planned or carried out this murder must be exposed and met with the full force of Canadian law.

Earlier on Friday, Canadian police released photographs of all three persons arrested in the killing of India-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year amid an ongoing probe into alleged connections of the Indian government.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in a statement named the three men, all Indian nationals, as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22 and released their photographs.

Along with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police have also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of the evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of the murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc refrained from confirming any connection to the Indian government, asserting that such inquiries should be directed to the RCMP, CTV News reported.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc said.\n\n\"The police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added, according to CTV News report.\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. The video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March this year showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a \"contract killing.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribuneindia.com",

They are accused of being the shooter, driver and lookout on the day Nijjar was killed.\n\nThey were arrested by police in Edmonton, in the neighbouring province of Alberta, where they reside, and are being held pending further proceedings.\n\nAll had been in Canada for between three and five years, police said at a news conference.\n\n\"This investigation does not end here. We are aware that others may have played a role in this homicide,\" said Mandeep Mooker of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's homicide investigations team.\n\n'Credible allegations'\n\nNijjar -- who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 -- advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India.\n\nHe was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, he was shot dead by masked assailants in the parking lot of the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver.\n\nTrudeau announced several months later that Canada had \"credible allegations\" linking Indian intelligence to the killing and expelled an Indian official, spurring the diplomatic tit-for-tat with New Delhi.\n\nMooker said Canadian police are still investigating the ties of the suspects, \"if any, to the Indian government.\"\n\n\"It is a bit of a sigh of relief that the investigation is moving forward,\" Moninder Singh, a close friend of Nijjar, told AFP.\n\n\"It is ultimately India who is responsible and hiring individuals to assassinate Sikh leaders in foreign countries,\" said Singh, spokesperson for the British Columbia Council of Gurdwaras.\n\nIn November, the US Justice Department charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on American soil.\n\nProsecutors said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning.\n\nThe shock allegations came after US President Joe Biden hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a rare state visit, as Washington seeks closer ties with India against China's growing influence.\n\nUS intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India's top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, The Washington Post reported this week.\n\nCanada is home to some 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two per cent of the country's population, with a vocal minority calling for an independent state of Khalistan. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

So, they have tried to create space for themselves in the politics of these countries. I mean, at this time, it's not so much a problem in the US.\"\n\n\"Our biggest problem right now is in Canada. Because in Canada, actually, today the party in power in Canada, and other parties in Canada have given these kinds of extremism, separatism, and advocates of violence a certain legitimacy in the name of free speech. See, when you tell them something, their answer is no no we are a democratic country but it is free speech. The point that they need to understand, it is no longer a world that runs as a one-way street. If there are that which happen out there, there will be pushback. Newton's law of politics will apply there also. There will be a reaction. Others will take steps or counter it,\" he added.\n\nHe said he saw reports that three people have been arrested, and, the Canadian police have conducted 'some investigation'.\n\nNijjar was shot and killed after he had stepped out of a gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A video clip of his killing reportedly surfaced in March this year, purportedly showing Nijjar being fatally shot by assailants, in what was claimed to be 'contract killing'.\n\nJaishankar said Canada has been welcoming people from India with links to organised crime, ignoring warnings by New Delhi.\n\n\"Often, when I see for example these kinds of attacks, threats to our embassies, because they concern me very deeply and I tell the foreign minister, suppose if (they) happened to you, if it was your embassy, your diplomat, your flag, how would you react. We have to keep our position strong on this particular report which has come. I also saw it yesterday night, I was coming to Odisha in the morning, somebody may have been arrested, their police may have done some investigation,\" Jaishankar said at the event.\n\n\"But, the fact is that a number of gangland people, a number of people with organised crime links from Punjab have been made welcome in Canada. We have been telling Canada saying look these are wanted criminals from India, you have given them visas. Many of them have come in false documentation and yet you allow them to live there. If you decide to import for political purposes people with very dubious, actually, very negative backgrounds, there will be issues, they have in some cases created problems in their own country as a result of their own policies. No, why would we fear, if something happens there, it is for them to worry about,\" he added.\n\nOn May 4, Canada's New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh levelled a fresh allegation of an India hand in the killing of Nijjar. However, the Canadian police administration did not share any evidence suggesting India's involvement in the killing of the Khaliatani leader.\n\nJagmeet's party backs the Liberal minority government led by Trudeau in exchange for support on some key bills.\n\nAfter the Canadian Police announced the arrest of three alleged accused in the killing of Hardep Nijjar, Jagmeet renewed his claim of an Indian hand in the incident.\n\n\"The Indian government hired assassins to murder a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil - at a place of worship. Today 3 arrests were made. Let me be clear - any Indian agent or state actor that ordered, planned or carried out this murder must be exposed and met with the full force of Canadian law. For Canada, democracy and free speech - there must be Justice for Hardeep Singh Nijjar,\" Jagmeet posted from his X handle.\n\nIn 2023, the Canadian PM alleged an Indian hand in the killing, a claim that was vehemently denied by India which called it 'absurd and motivated'. The Canadian Police have also not given any evidence linking India to the killing.\n\nEarlier, on Friday, Canadian police released photographs of all three persons arrested in the killing of India-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year amid an ongoing probe into alleged connections of the Indian government.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in a statement named the three men, all Indian nationals, as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22 and released their photographs. The trio were arrested in Edmonton City in Alberta.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of Surrey, RCMP on Friday (local time) said that on the morning of May 3, IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta RCMP and the Edmonton Police Service, arrested the three men for the June 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey.\n\nThe trio have now been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the homicide, according to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police press release. Along with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police have also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of the evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of the murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nIndia and Canada are dealing with an unprecedented diplomatic crisis, after the Canadian Prime Minister accused agents of the Indian government of killing Canadian Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023.

Today 3 arrests were made. Let me be clear - any Indian agent or state actor that ordered, planned or carried out this murder must be exposed and met with the full force of Canadian law. For Canada, democracy and free speech - there must be Justice for Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\"\n\nLast year Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau had also alleged an Indian hand in the killing, a claim that was vehemently denied by India which called it 'absurd and motivated'.\n\nCandian Police personnel have also not given any evidence of any link to India as was being speculated in Canadian media. Earlier on Friday, Canadian police released photographs of all three persons arrested in the killing of India-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year amid an ongoing probe into alleged connections of the Indian government.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in a statement named the three men, all Indian nationals, as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22 and released their photographs. The trio were arrested in Edmonton City in Alberta.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of Surrey, RCMP on Friday (local time) said that on the morning of May 3, IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta RCMP and the Edmonton Police Service, arrested the three men for the June 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey.\n\nThe trio have now been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the homicide, according to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police press release. Along with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police have also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of the evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of the murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc refrained from confirming any connection to the Indian government, asserting that such inquiries should be directed to the RCMP, CTV News reported.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc said.\n\n\"The police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added, according to CTV News report.\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. The video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March this year showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a \"contract killing.\"\n\nThis report is auto-generated from a

Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar", "body": "Three Indian men living in Edmonton have been arrested and charged with the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a B.C. Sikh separatist leader whose death last year was linked to the Indian government by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nRCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul affirmed Friday the force's probe included \"investigating connections to the government of India.\" He said there are numerous cases still open and they are \"certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today.\"\n\nThe killing became a full-blown diplomatic row last September after Mr. Trudeau told the House of Commons that Canadian security agencies were probing allegations that the Indian government had played a role in the slaying of Mr. Nijjar.\n\nHe told MPs that he had personally presented his concerns about these allegations to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nIn November, U.S. authorities said an Indian government official had directed a plot in the attempted murder of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist and dual citizen of the United States and Canada.\n\nOn Friday, RCMP took pains to thank members of the Sikh community in Surrey, particularly the leadership of the Guru Nanak temple.\n\n\"The murder of Mr. Nijjar at the Scott Road gurdwara was outrageous and it was reprehensible,\" said Assistant Commissioner Brian Edwards.\n\n\"It had a profound impact on the residents of Surrey and notwithstanding today the announcing of charges, those scars will remain in our community for some time.\"\n\nMr. Nijjar was ambushed as he exited the parking lot at the Guru Nanak temple in Surrey last June 18, Father's Day. He was heading home for a late dinner with his wife and sons.\n\nMoninder Singh is a spokesperson for the B.C. Gurdwara Council and was a close friend of Mr. Nijjar. Both were among five men warned by the RCMP's national security division in August 2022 that their lives were in danger. Mr. Singh took part in an emotional briefing with Mounties and Mr. Nijjar's family on Friday morning.\n\nHe said news of the arrests brings some measure of relief, but noted the case is still open and that eyewitnesses saw at least five men in the getaway car on the day of the murder.\n\nMr. Singh also alleged India still poses a credible threat to activists in the Sikh diaspora. He said the community is keen to understand any potential links the charges Friday have to the Modi government.\n\n\"It has to do with India's involvement in this, how these individuals utilized their potential criminal ties back in India, how they got into the country - all of those are questions that are outstanding for all of us right now,\" he told reporters outside the RCMP press conference.\n\nMr. Pannun, who lives in New York, said the arrest \"only scratches the surface.\" He called on Canada to charge high-ranking Indian diplomats.\n\nRCMP officials say the three arrested are not residents of Canada and were not known to police. They say further charges are possible.\n\nCourt documents show Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22, and Karan Brar, 22, have been charged with first-degree murder for a killing that they are alleged to have started plotting in Edmonton and Surrey in May 2023. All three are also charged with conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nThe trio had been living in Canada for three to five years, RCMP said, and the investigation that led to their charges included RCMP from Alberta, British Columbia and one other province the force would not name.\n\nIndian High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma said he would not comment on \"arrests made for crimes committed in Canada,\" calling \"this an internal matter for Canada.\"\n\nIndia considers Mr. Nijjar a terrorist and had him listed among the country's most wanted.\n\nWhen asked how the RCMP would characterize investigators' interaction with Indian officials in Canada, Assistant Commissioner Teboul described it as \"challenging and difficult.\"\n\nMr. Nijjar was involved in a campaign aimed at the creation of a Sikh state carved from India. His group, Sikhs for Justice, has been holding referendums - non-binding votes - at Sikh temples across Canada, Britain, Australia and the United States. Hundreds of thousands of Sikhs have participated.\n\nPrabjot Singh, a member of the executive council at Guru Nanak, accused the Indian government of being willing to use organized crime groups as proxies in its fight to silence political dissidents abroad.\n\n\"This [Mr. Nijjar's murder] is very clearly a part of a much larger conspiracy and this is an initial step in advancing this investigation and unravelling all the different component parts,\" Mr. Singh told reporters.\n\nNews of the arrests arrived on the same day that a commission of inquiry into foreign interference in Canada released its report after months of testimony. In her report, Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue said Indian officials, including Canada-based proxies, seek to influence Canadian communities and politicians.\n\nThese activities include efforts to align Canada's position with India's interest in key areas, particularly on the issue of an independent Sikh homeland in the Indian state of Punjab, she said.\n\nWhile she made no mention of the murder of Mr. Nijjar, Justice Hogue said Indian officials rely on networks of proxies to \"liaise and work with Indian intelligence officials in India and Canada, talking both explicit and implicit directions from them.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_hager@theglobeandmail.com", "name": "Mike Hager",

We are aware that others may have played a role in this homicide, and we remain dedicated to finding and arresting each one of these individuals,\" Mooker said.\n\nHe added that police are \"investigating if there are any ties to the government of India\".\n\n\"However, as I said, it's an ongoing investigation and I don't have any information to provide on that matter at this time.\"\n\nA few months later, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the country's security agencies were investigating \"credible allegations of a potential link\" between Indian government agents and Nijjar's killing.\n\n\"In the strongest possible terms, I continue to urge the government of India to cooperate with Canada to get to the bottom of this matter.\"\n\nHis comments spurred a fierce response from India, which rejected the allegations as \"absurd\" and politically motivated. New Delhi also accused Canada of not doing enough to stem anti-India activism and \"Sikh extremism\".\n\nBut Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long faced allegations of targeting political opponents, journalists and religious minorities, including Muslims and Sikhs, in what rights groups have said is a continuing effort to stifle dissent.\n\nAt the time of Nijjar's killing, tensions had been growing between Canada and India over a Sikh campaign for a sovereign state in India's Punjab region. Known as the Khalistan movement, the campaign has supporters in Canada.\n\nAsked to comment on Friday's reports that arrests were made in the case, Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc referred reporters' questions to the RCMP.\n\n\"You'll understand that the developments with respect to the murder of a Canadian citizen, Mr Nijjar, are part of an ongoing police operation. This operation started today. It is still an active police operation,\" LeBlanc said in Ottawa.\n\nThe RCMP identified the three men arrested on Friday as Kamalpreet Singh, Karanpreet Singh and Karan Brar.\n\nMooker, the police superintendent, said all three were non-permanent residents of Canada and had been in the country for between three to five years.\n\nCBC News reported earlier in the day that, according to unnamed sources, \"members of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters\" on the day Nijjar was killed.\n\n\"Sources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance,\" the Canadian broadcaster said.\n\nThe High Commission of India in Ottawa did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment on Friday afternoon.\n\nNijjar's killing continues to raise questions around allegations of Indian foreign interference, particularly within Sikh diaspora communities in Canada, the United States and other countries.\n\nIn September, Moninder Singh at the BC Gurdwaras Council told Al Jazeera that he was among five Sikh leaders -- including Nijjar -- who were warned by the RCMP's national security division in 2022 about threats against their lives.\n\nOn Friday, Danish Singh, president of the World Sikh Organization of Canada advocacy group, welcomed the arrests in Nijjar's case but said they also raise new questions.\n\n\"While the arrest of the hit squad is important, what's even more important is identifying and bringing to justice those who directed these operations,\" Singh said in a statement, accusing the Indian government of being involved.\n\nReports of an alleged plot to kill another prominent Sikh separatist leader in the US have also emerged following Nijjar's death. In late November, the US Department of Justice announced charges against a 52-year-old Indian national, Nikhil Gupta.\n\nGupta was accused of being part of a foiled attempt to assassinate US citizen Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, in coordination with an Indian government employee and others.\n\nThe Washington Post reported earlier this week that US intelligence agencies determined that the operation to target Pannun was approved by the then-head of India's foreign intelligence agency, known as RAW.\n\nThe Indian government rejected those allegations as \"unwarranted\" and \"unsubstantiated\", according to media reports.\n\nOn Monday, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre described the Washington Post report as \"a serious matter\".\n\n\"The government of India has been very clear with us that they are taking this seriously and will investigate -- and we expect that accountability from the government,\" Jean-Pierre told reporters during a news briefing.", "source": {"uri":

Today 3 arrests were made. Let me be clear - any Indian agent or state actor that ordered, planned or carried out this murder must be exposed and met with the full force of Canadian law.

Earlier on Friday, Canadian police released photographs of all three persons arrested in the killing of India-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year amid an ongoing probe into alleged connections of the Indian government.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in a statement named the three men, all Indian nationals, as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22 and released their photographs.

Along with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police have also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar...

Sikh activist, Nijjar", "body": "SURREY, B.C. -- Three Indian nationals have been charged with the murder of B.C. Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in a killing last year that threw Ottawa's relationship with New Delhi into disarray.\n\nPolice say they are investigating if the Indian government was involved, an allegation raised by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the House of Commons last year.\n\nIntegrated Homicide Investigation Team Supt. Mandeep Mooker said in a news conference on Friday that the three men had been arrested in Edmonton that morning, and there may be more suspects and arrests as the investigation progresses.\n\n\"We are investigating if there are any ties to the government of India,\" Mooker said. \"However ... it's an ongoing investigation, and I don't have any information to provide on that matter at this time.\"\n\nNijjar was shot and killed in his pickup truck last June as he left the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., touching off a wave of protests and rallies from local communities against diplomats from India.\n\nHe was the president at the gurdwara where he was killed. Nijjar also campaigned for a separate Sikh homeland in India -- also known as Khalistan -- and organized unofficial referendums around the world about Punjabi independence.\n\nB.C. Gurdwaras Council spokesman Moninder Singh said he and Nijjar's family were briefed by investigators in Surrey about the arrests, and Nijjar's children were \"very emotional.\"\n\n\"At the moment, there is a bit of a sigh of relief in their father's murder,\" said Singh. \"There's a bit of anger and frustration around why this had to happen in the first place, and then there are a lot of questions around India.\n\n\"Is this over? How do we go back into our community and have this conversation around is this safe or is it not safe?\"\n\nTrudeau said in September that there was credible intelligence linking Nijjar's killing to the Indian government, touching off a diplomatic row that resulted in India suspending issuing visas to Canadians for two months.\n\nIndia has repeatedly denied involvement in Nijjar's death.\n\nRCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said police in Canada have been trying to collaborate with Indian authorities on investigations such as the Nijjar case, an effort that began before his killing.\n\n\"I'll be frank, I'll characterize that collaboration as rather challenging and difficult for the last several years,\" Teboul said. \"However, the RCMP is very committed to continuing to establish a working relationship from law enforcement to law enforcement agency. So we're going to continue our efforts.\n\n\"But it's been difficult.\"\n\nPolice say the three suspects arrested in Nijjar's killing, Karan Brar, Karanpreet Singh and Kamalpreet Singh are all male Indian nationals in their 20s living in Edmonton.\n\nMooker said the men have been in Canada for three to five years as non-permanent residents but provided no other details on their immigration status.\n\nPolice say the three suspects are expected to be transported to B.C. by Monday to face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun is a New-York-based Sikh independence activist who U.S. prosecutors say was a target in an assassination plot directed by an Indian government official.\n\nHe said the arrests were \"a step forward\" but \"only scratch the surface.\"\n\n\"Shaheed Nijar was my dear personal friend and close associate,\" Pannun said in a statement, using an honorific implying martyrdom. \"He was an upright individual, a peaceful man with demonstrated commitment to community service.\n\n\"Canadian politicians of every stripe must stand with the Canadian Sikhs' right to peacefully advocate for Khalistan without facing any violent retaliation from the Indian Government.\"\n\nThe World Sikh Organization of Canada echoed those sentiments, saying it welcomed the news of the arrest of three members of an \"alleged hit squad that assassinated\" Nijjar.\n\nBut the group said in a statement that it believes the arrests raise disturbing questions about the connection between India's government and criminal gangs.\n\nIt noted that the report by the Foreign Interference Commission says India uses proxies in Canada who work with intelligence officials in Indian and Canada.\n\nAn interim report into foreign interference released Friday in Ottawa said Indian officials engaged in a range of activities to influence Canada's communities and politicians.\n\nIt says India's interests in Canada related to the large South Asian community in the country.\n\n\"India does not differentiate between lawful, pro-Khalistani political advocacy and the relatively small Canada-based Khalistani violent extremism,\" the report says.\n\nIndian officials in Canada have increasingly relied on Canadian proxies and contacts in its network to conduct foreign interference, the report says.\n\n\"It views anyone aligned with Khalistani separatism as a seditious threat to India. Targets of Indian foreign interference are often members of the Indo-Canadian communities, but prominent non-Indo-Canadians are also subject to India's foreign influence activities.\"\n\n-- By Chuck

The suspects, Karanpreet Singh (28), Kamalpreet Singh (22), and Karan Brar (22), are facing charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) stated that they are investigating whether the arrested individuals have any connections to the Indian government. This development follows Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's previous remarks suggesting possible involvement of Indian government entities in the assassination, leading to tensions between Ottawa and New Delhi.\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen advocating for the establishment of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland, had been labeled a \"terrorist\" by the Indian government. His assassination further strained relations between Canada and India.\n\nThe arrests in Edmonton, Alberta, were made in collaboration with US law enforcement agencies, although specific details were not disclosed. Canadian authorities hinted at the possibility of more arrests in connection with the murder.\n\nBalpreet Singh, representing the Canada-based World Sikh Organization, welcomed the arrests but raised questions about potential directives behind the hit, suggesting a deeper layer to the investigation.\n\nThe extradition of the suspects to British Columbia for legal proceedings is expected by Monday. Trudeau's previous assertion of alleged Indian government involvement in the murder had been refuted by New Delhi as baseless. Additionally, last year, US authorities revealed an alleged Indian government role in a failed assassination attempt on Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist with dual citizenship in the US and

So, they have tried to create space for themselves in the politics of these countries. I mean, at this time, it's not so much a problem in the US.\"\n\n\"Our biggest problem right now is in Canada. Because in Canada, actually, today the party in power in Canada, and other parties in Canada have given these kinds of extremism, separatism, and advocates of violence a certain legitimacy in the name of free speech. See, when you tell them something, their answer is no, we are a democratic country but it is free speech. The point that they need to understand, it is no longer a world that runs as a one-way street. If there are that which happen out there, there will be pushback. Newton's law of politics will apply there also. There will be a reaction. Others will take steps or counter it,\" he added.\n\nHe said he saw reports that three people have been arrested, and, the Canadian police have conducted 'some investigation'. Nijjar was shot and killed after he had stepped out of a gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A video clip of his killing reportedly surfaced in March this year, purportedly showing Nijjar being fatally shot by assailants, in what was claimed to be 'contract killing'.\n\nJaishankar said Canada has been welcoming people from India with links to organised crime, ignoring warnings by New Delhi.\n\n\"Often, when I see for example these kinds of attacks, threats to our embassies, because they concern me very deeply and I tell the foreign minister, suppose if (they) happened to you, if it was your embassy, your diplomat, your flag, how would you react. We have to keep our position strong on this particular report which has come. I also saw it yesterday night, I was coming to Odisha in the morning, somebody may have been arrested, their police may have done some investigation,\" Jaishankar said at the event.\n\n\"But, the fact is that a number of gangland people, a number of people with organised crime links from Punjab have been made welcome in Canada. We have been telling Canada saying look these are wanted criminals from India, you have given them visas. Many of them have come in false documentation and yet you allow them to live there. If you decide to import for political purposes people with very dubious, actually, very negative backgrounds, there will be issues, they have in some cases created problems in their own country as a result of their own policies. No, why would we fear, if something happens there, it is for them to worry about,\" he added.\n\nOn May 4, Canada's New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh levelled a fresh allegation of an India hand in the killing of Nijjar.\n\nHowever, the Canadian police administration did not share any evidence suggesting India's involvement in the killing of the Khaliatani leader. Jagmeet's party backs the Liberal minority government led by Trudeau in exchange for support on some key bills. After the Canadian Police announced the arrest of three alleged accused in the killing of Hardep Nijjar, Jagmeet renewed his claim of an Indian hand in the incident.\n\n\"The Indian government hired assassins to murder a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil - at a place of worship. Today 3 arrests were made. Let me be clear - any Indian agent or state actor that ordered, planned or carried out this murder must be exposed and met with the full force of Canadian law. For Canada, democracy and free speech - there must be Justice for Hardeep Singh Nijjar,\" Jagmeet posted from his X handle.\n\nIn 2023, the Canadian PM alleged an Indian hand in the killing, a claim that was vehemently denied by India which called it 'absurd and motivated'.\n\nThe Canadian Police have also not given any evidence linking India to the killing. Earlier, on Friday, Canadian police released photographs of all three persons arrested in the killing of India-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year amid an ongoing probe into alleged connections of the Indian government. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in a statement named the three men, all Indian nationals, as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22 and released their photographs.\n\nThe trio were arrested in Edmonton City in Alberta. The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of Surrey, RCMP on Friday (local time) said that on the morning of May 3, IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta RCMP and the Edmonton Police Service, arrested the three men for the June 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey.\n\nThe trio have now been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the homicide, according to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police press release. Along with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police have also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of the evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of the murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nIndia and Canada are dealing with an unprecedented diplomatic crisis, after the Canadian Prime Minister accused agents of the Indian government of killing Canadian Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023. However, India has dismissed the accusations as 'absurd' and 'motivated.'", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S.

Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday, the report said.\n\nNijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen, was shot dead on June 18, shortly after evening prayers at his Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan people.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a \"problem\" and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n\"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n\"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIn his comments to the media, Trudeau, referring to activities by pro-Khalistani elements, said that \"our job is not to crack down on political protest\".\n\nIndia on Monday summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-'Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n\"It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,\" Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity.\n\nSubsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.

Today 3 arrests were made. Let me be clear - any Indian agent or state actor that ordered, planned or carried out this murder must be exposed and met with the full force of Canadian law.

Earlier on Friday, Canadian police released photographs of all three persons arrested in the killing of India-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year amid an ongoing probe into alleged connections of the Indian government.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in a statement named the three men, all Indian nationals, as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22 and released their photographs. The trio were arrested in Edmonton City in Alberta.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of Surrey, RCMP on Friday (local time) said that on the morning of May 3, IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta RCMP and the Edmonton Police Service, arrested the three men for the June 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey.\n\nThe trio have now been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the homicide, according to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police press release. Along with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police have also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of the evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of the murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc refrained from confirming any connection to the Indian government, asserting that such inquiries should be directed to the RCMP, CTV News reported.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc said.\n\n\"The police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added, according to CTV News report.\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. The video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March this year showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a \"contract killing.\" (ANI)", "source": {"uri":

In response to the allegatio ns, India told Canada last year to remove 41 of its 62 diplomats in the country.

But he had denied allegations of ties to terrorism.\n\nA bloody decadelong Sikh insurgency shook north India in the 1970s and 1980s, until it was crushed in a government crackdown in which thousands of people were killed, including prominent Sikh leaders.\n\nThe Khalistan movement has lost much of its political power but still has supporters in the Indian state of Punjab, as well as in the sizable overseas Sikh diaspora.

The men are accused of conspiring \"with others to commit the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar,\" according to the filings. They are also charged on a second count for using a firearm \"on or about June 18, 2023... to commit first-degree murder.\"\n\nAll three suspects are Indian nationals and non-permanent residents of Canada, police said in a press briefing on Wednesday. Authorities are currently investigating if they have ties to the Indian government - the latest development in a long-running intrigue that has fueled diplomatic tension between Canada and India.\n\nNijjar, a Canadian citizen, was gunned down by masked men last June outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia. He was a prominent campaigner for a separate Sikh homeland out of India, which would be known as Khalistan and include parts of India's Punjab state.\n\nLast September, Trudeau said he had credible information linking the Indian government to the killing of Nijjar. The allegation outraged India, which has forcefully denied the claim, calling it \"absurd and motivated.\" The diplomatic fallout saw tit-for-tat expulsions of senior diplomats from both countries.\n\nAuthorities on Wednesday did not specify who allegedly conspired with the accused but said there are separate investigations ongoing on Nijjar's death.\n\n\"These efforts include investigating connections to the Government of India,\" Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner David Teboul told a Friday press conference.\n\nCampaigning for the creation of Khalistan has long been outlawed in India, where painful memories of a deadly insurgency by some Sikh separatists continue to haunt many Indian citizens. But it garners a level of public sympathy among some in the Sikh diaspora overseas, where activists protected by free speech laws can more openly demand secession from India.\n\nWeeks after Trudeau's announcement, the United States accused an Indian government official of being involved in a conspiracy to kill another Sikh separatist, American citizen Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, on US soil. A US indictment unsealed in November accused an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, of trying to kill Pannun, who is a wanted man in India and considered to be a terrorist by the government.\n\nUS prosecutors say Gupta was acting on orders from an unnamed Indian government official. India's government has denied any involvement in the alleged plot to kill Pannun.\n\nJust one day after Nijjar was killed in Canada, US prosecutors say Gupta allegedly told an undercover law enforcement official posing as a hitman that Nijjar had also been one of his targets.\n\n\"We have so many targets,\" Gupta allegedly said.\n\nNijjar's assassination has sent a chill through Sikh activists living abroad. Dr. Pritpal Singh, an American citizen who heads the American Sikh Caucus Committee, told CNN he was alerted with a \"duty to warn\" by the FBI of a threat to his life after the Canadian's assassination.\n\nHe commended Canadian law enforcement for its \"dedication to upholding justice by rigorously pursuing those responsible for these crimes\" in a statement, adding that \"we, as a community, stand firm in demanding accountability and will continue to advocate for justice to ensure such reprehensible actions are addressed decisively.\"\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

India has repeatedly denied the allegations, terming them \"absurd and motivated.\"\n\nGiving an address at the Sikh Foundation of Canada's Centennial Gala event held at the Royal Ontario Museum on Sunday, Trudeau began by acknowledging the arrests made in connection to the case, emphasising that the investigation remains ongoing.\n\n\"I need to begin, somewhat awkwardly perhaps, but importantly, to acknowledge the arrests that were made in relation to the murder of Nijjar. As the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) stated, the investigation remains ongoing, as does a separate and distinct investigation, not limited to the involvement of the three people arrested yesterday,\" he said.\n\nHe highlighted Canada's status as a rule-of-law country with a robust and independent justice system. \"This is important because Canada is a rule-of-law country with a strong and independent justice system, as well as a fundamental commitment to protecting all its citizens. I know that many Canadians, particularly members of the Sikh community, are feeling uneasy and perhaps even frightened right now,\" Trudeau added.\n\nTrudeau also reassured that every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free from discrimination and violence. He urged them to \"remain calm... remain steadfast in our commitment to our democratic principles and our system of justice. This is who we are and what we do as Canadians\".\n\nA day ago, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Canada has been issuing visas to people with links to organised crime despite warnings from New Delhi. Jaishankar said some people in Canada, with 'pro-Pakistan leanings', have organised themselves politically and taken the shape of an influential political lobby. He said he saw reports that three people have been arrested, and, the Canadian police have conducted 'some investigation'.\n\nNijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Surrey RCMP received a report of a shooting at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey. First responding members located a man, later identified as Hardeep Singh Nijjar, suffering from fatal gunshot wounds inside a vehicle.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) has been carrying out the investigation. It has continued to work closely with a number of partner agencies and support services across Canada, as far east as Ontario, including the Surrey RCMP, the Alberta RCMP and other Lower Mainland Integrated Teams.\n\nNijjar's killing triggered diplomatic tensions between Canada and India after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of being involved in the killing -- a claim that India has rejected as \"absurd.\"\n\nThe video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March this year showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a \"contract killing\".

A US indictment unsealed in November accused Indian national Nikhil Gupta of trying to kill American citizen Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who is also wanted in India and considered a terrorist by the government.\n\nAccording to US prosecutors, Gupta was following orders from an alleged Indian government official. The Indian government, however, has denied any involvement in the purported murder plot against Pannun. US prosecutors said Gupta allegedly told an undercover law enforcement agent masquerading as a hitman that Nijjar was one of his targets, just one day after his death in Canada. \"We have so many targets,\" Gupta allegedly said.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karan Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l48920240504093731.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 871, "textEnd": 878}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

He said all three had been living in Edmonton, Alberta where they were arrested. They have been charged with first-degree murder, court records show, as well as conspiracy to commit murder. All had been in Canada for three to five years, police said.Police added that investigations were continuing, including into \"connections to the government of India\".\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters. Certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today,\" Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said.Investigators have been working with counterparts in India but the collaboration has been \"rather difficult and rather challenging\" for several years, they saidPolice said there may be others involved in the killing, and there may be further arrests or charges.Who was Canadian Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar?Mr Nijjar was a Sikh separatist leader who publicly campaigned for Khalistan - the creation of an independent Sikh homeland in the Punjab region of India.In the 1970s, Sikhs launched a separatist insurgency in India which saw thousands killed before it was quelled the following decade. Since then, the movement has been mostly limited to countries with large Sikh populations.India has in the past described Mr Nijjar as a terrorist who led a militant separatist group - accusations his supporters say are unfounded. They say he had received threats in the past because of his activism.He was shot dead at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, a city about 30km (18 miles) east of Vancouver on 18 June last year.Those close to him have said he was warned by Canadian intelligence services before his death that he was on a \"hit list\" and there had been threats on his life. Moninder Singh, a member of the British Columbia Gurdwaras Council who was friends with Mr Nijjar for 15 years, told BBC News that the Sikh community was grateful to see progress in the investigation.However he said there were still \"public safety concerns\" and \"a lot of tension. There's frustration. And there's a hope, as well.\"This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Three months after he was killed, Mr Trudeau, standing in the House of Commons, said Canada was looking at \"credible allegations potentially linking\" the Indian state to the killing. The allegation had been strongly denied by Indian officials, who accused Canada of providing shelter to \"Khalistani terrorists and extremists\". The row between the two countries led Delhi to ask Ottawa to reduce the number of envoys it had in India.Mr Trudeau has also faced pressure to provide evidence for his allegation of Delhi's involvement.Related TopicsIndiaCanada ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Today 3 arrests were made. Let me be clear - any Indian agent or state actor that ordered, planned or carried out this murder must be exposed and met with the full force of Canadian law. For Canada, democracy and free speech - there must be Justice for Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\"\n\nLast year Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau had also alleged an Indian hand in the killing, a claim that was vehemently denied by India which called it 'absurd and motivated'.\n\nCandian Police personnel have also not given any evidence of any link to India as was being speculated in Canadian media. Earlier on Friday, Canadian police released photographs of all three persons arrested in the killing of India-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year amid an ongoing probe into alleged connections of the Indian government.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in a statement named the three men, all Indian nationals, as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22 and released their photographs.

Along with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police have also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of the evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of the murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc refrained from confirming any connection to the Indian government, asserting that such inquiries should be directed to the RCMP, CTV News reported.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc said.\n\n\"The police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added, according to CTV News report.\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. The video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March this year showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a \"contract killing.\"", "source": {"uri":

New Delhi also accused Canada of not doing enough to stem anti-India activism and \"Sikh extremism\".\n\nBut Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long faced allegations of targeting political opponents, journalists and religious minorities, including Muslims and Sikhs, in what rights groups have said is a continuing effort to stifle dissent.\n\nAt the time of Nijjar's killing, tensions had been growing bet ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sikhism in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_nationality_law", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian nationality law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Indian_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Indian sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 729, "textEnd": 736}], "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The Police are expected to share details later Friday (local time). Nijjar was killed outside the Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia on June 18.\n\nThe Canadian Police have arrested some persons behind the killing of India designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June last year, Canadian news site CBC News revealed on Friday. The report said that Canadian police are investigating the links between the alleged shooters and three additional killings in Canada. The police are expected to share details later Friday (local time). Nijjar was killed outside the Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18.\n\nThe CBC report further claimed that the \"arrested men could be part of an alleged hit squad tasked by the government of India.\" This charge has been repeatedly denied by India. In September 2023, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said that the Indian government had told Canada that it was not Government of India policy to engage in such acts like the killing of Hardeep Nijjar In its report on Friday, CBC news further quoted sources, saying that the arrested men arrived in Canada on temporary visas after 2021. They are said to be alleged associates of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who is currently under arrest in India. Bishnoi is accused of plotting the killing of popular singer Sidhu Moose Wala in May 2022.\n\nAccording to another Canadian news outlet, CTV news, court documents show the three arrested as Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh and Karan Brar. They face one count of first degree murder and a count of conspiracy to commit murder. The arrests come in the backdrop of frayed relationship between India and Canada. Last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had alleged that there was an Indian government hand behind the killing of Nijjar, a charge that the Indian government had vehemently denied, calling it absurd.\n\nEarlier this month, purported video footage of the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar surfaced, showing Nijjar being shot by armed men. Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by the National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia. The attack was described as 'highly coordinated' and involved six men and two vehicles. The India-Canada relationship continues to be troubled. On May 2, the Ministry of External Affairs condemned pro-Khalistan slogans at a public event attended by Justin Trudeau, and stressed that this shows the kind of political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nDuring the weekly briefing, the MEA spokesperson said, \"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well...His remarks illustrate once again the kind of political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence. This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens.\" During the Khalsa Day Celebrations that took place in Toronto, loud chants of pro-Khalistan slogans were seen being raised in the presence of Canadian PM Trudeau, as well as opposition leader Pierre Poilievre.

They have sent money and resources to support the cause and have staged unofficial referendums here in Canada, actions that have been condemned by India's leadership.\n\nTrudeau, like his predecessors, has said Canada supports a \"united India.\"\n\nHe hasn't cracked down on Sikh separatist discourse, despite intense Indian pressure to do so. Some Sikh Canadians have defended the push for an independent \"Khalistan\" as a peaceful movement for greater Sikh autonomy in India.\n\nThe fractious relationship came to a head last fall when Trudeau said publicly that Canadian authorities have been \"actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link\" between agents working for the Indian government and the murder of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar outside his Surrey, B.C. gurdwara in June 2023.\n\nIndia rejected Trudeau's claim as \"absurd\" and accused Canadians of interfering in \"internal matters.\" Both countries subsequently kicked out each other's diplomats.\n\nOn Friday, Canadian police arrested members of a hit squad alleged to have carried out the Nijjar killing. Investigators have said they believe the alleged assassins were retained by the Indian government.\n\nSpeaking to Punjabi media in Canada on the Sunday before those arrests, Trudeau said the Nijjar investigation will reveal some \"very, very clear things that everyone around the world -- including in India -- will see as to the responsibilities and involvement.\"\n\nHere is a timeline of some of the events that have complicated Canada's bilateral relationship with India, the world's largest democracy.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau comes in for criticism after a troubled trip to India -- a week-long visit meant to bolster relations with the world's largest democracy.\n\nTrudeau had intended to use the trip to smooth over long-simmering tensions about support for Sikh separatism in the Canadian diaspora, and to bolster Canada's relatively weak trading relationship with India.\n\nBut the visit gets derailed when news emerges that Jaspal Atwal, a B.C. man convicted of attempting to murder an Indian politician in Canada, was invited by a Liberal MP to two functions attended by Trudeau.\n\nThe invitation, while not sanctioned by Trudeau, is a diplomatic embarrassment.\n\nTrudeau and his family are also mocked for wearing traditional Indian garb during the visit, which attracts negative scrutiny at home and abroad.\n\nTrudeau's national security adviser accuses India of being one of the top sources of foreign interference in Canada, a public designation Ottawa had largely limited to authoritarian states up to that point.\n\nIn early June, India's foreign minister, S. Jaishankar, criticizes Canada for allowing a float in a parade depicting the 1984 assassination of then-Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her bodyguards. India sees the float as an effort to glorify violence by Sikh separatists.\n\nTwo weeks later, on the evening of June 18, Sikh community leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar is shot dead outside his gurdwara in Surrey, B.C.

The police are expected to share details later Friday (local time). Nijjar was killed outside the Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18.\n\nThe CBC report further claimed that the \"arrested men could be part of an alleged hit squad tasked by the government of India.\" This charge has been repeatedly denied by India. In September 2023, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said that the Indian government had told Canada that it was not Government of India policy to engage in such acts like the killing of Hardeep Nijjar\n\nIn its report on Friday, CBC news further quoted sources, saying that the arrested men arrived in Canada on temporary visas after 2021. They are said to be alleged associates of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who is currently under arrest in India. Bishnoi is accused of plotting the killing of popular singer Sidhu Moose Wala in May 2022.\n\nAccording to another Canadian news outlet, CTV news, court documents show the three arrested as Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh and Karan Brar. They face one count of first degree murder and a count of conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nThe arrests come in the backdrop of frayed relationship between India and Canada. Last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had alleged that there was an Indian government hand behind the killing of Nijjar, a charge that the Indian government had vehemently denied, calling it absurd.\n\nEarlier this month, purported video footage of the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar surfaced, showing Nijjar being shot by armed men. Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by the National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia. The attack was described as 'highly coordinated' and involved six men and two vehicles.\n\nThe India-Canada relationship continues to be troubled. On May 2, the Ministry of External Affairs condemned pro-Khalistan slogans at a public event attended by Justin Trudeau, and stressed that this shows the kind of political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nDuring the weekly briefing, the MEA spokesperson said, \"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well...His remarks illustrate once again the kind of political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence. This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens.\"\n\nDuring the Khalsa Day Celebrations that took place in Toronto, loud chants of pro-Khalistan slogans were seen being raised in the presence of Canadian PM Trudeau, as well as opposition leader Pierre Poilievre.

They are accused of conspiring \"with others to commit the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar,\" according to the filings.\n\nNijjar, a Canadian citizen, was gunned down by masked men last June outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia. He was a prominent campaigner for a separate Sikh homeland out of India, which would be known as Khalistan and include parts of India's Punjab state.\n\nLast September, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had credible information linking the Indian government to the killing of Nijjar. The allegation outraged India, which has vehemently denied the claim, calling it \"absurd and motivated.\" The diplomatic fallout saw tit-for-tat expulsions of senior diplomats from both countries.\n\nCampaigning for the creation of Khalistan has long been outlawed in India, where painful memories of a deadly insurgency by some Sikh separatists continue to haunt many Indian citizens. But it garners a level of public sympathy among some in the Sikh diaspora overseas, where activists protected by free speech laws can more openly demand secession from India.\n\nWeeks after Trudeau's announcement, the United States accused an Indian government official of being involved in a conspiracy to kill another Sikh separatist, American citizen Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, on US soil. A US indictment unsealed in November accused an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, of trying to kill Pannun, who is a wanted man in India and considered to be a terrorist by the government.\n\nUS prosecutors say Gupta was acting on orders from an unnamed Indian government official. India's government has denied any involvement in the alleged plot to kill Pannun.\n\nJust one day after Nijjar was killed in Canada, US prosecutors say Gupta allegedly told an undercover law enforcement official posing as a hitman that Nijjar had also been one of his targets.\n\n\"We have so many targets,\" Gupta allegedly said.\n\nNijjar's assassination has sent a chill through Sikh activists living abroad. Dr. Pritpal Singh, an American citizen who heads the American Sikh Caucus Committee, told CNN he was alerted with a \"duty to warn\" by the FBI of a threat to his life after the Canadian's assassination.\n\nHe commended Canadian law enforcement for its \"dedication to upholding justice by rigorously pursuing those responsible for these crimes\" in a statement, adding that \"we, as a community, stand firm in demanding accountability and will continue to advocate for justice to ensure such reprehensible actions are addressed decisively.\"\n\nThis is a developing story and will be

The trio were arrested in Edmonton city in Alberta.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of Surrey, RCMP on Friday (local time) said that on the morning of May 3, IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta RCMP and the Edmonton Police Service, arrested the three men for the June 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey a suburb in Vancouver.\n\nThe trio have now been charged with first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the homicide.\n\nAlong with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police has also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar.... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc refrained from confirming any connection to the Indian government, asserting that such inquiries should be directed to the RCMP, CTV News report.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc said.\n\n\"The police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added, according to CTV News report.\n\nPolice personnel have not given any evidence of any link to India as was being speculated in Canadian media. India has repeatedly denied the allegations, terming them \"absurd and motivated.\"\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Surrey RCMP received a report of a shooting at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey. First responding members located a man, later identified as Hardeep Singh Nijjar, suffering from fatal gunshot wounds inside a vehicle.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) has been carrying out the investigation. It has continued to work closely with a number of partner agencies and support services across Canada, as far east as Ontario, including the Surrey RCMP, the Alberta RCMP and other Lower Mainland Integrated Teams.\n\nThe Canadian police have not given any evidence of any link to India as was being speculated in Canadian media.\n\nNijjar's killing triggered diplomatic tensions between Canada and India after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of being involved in the killing -- a claim which India has rejected as \"absurd.\"\n\nThe video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March this year showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a \"contract killing\".\n\nThis report is auto-generated from a syndicated feed\n\nComments", "source":

Jaishankar's responses came during an interaction with journalists in Odisha capital Bhubaneswar.\n\nThe relationship between India and Canada deteriorated significantly when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Indian operatives of \"potential\" involvement in Nijjar's death in September of last year. India has slammed Trudeau's allegations as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\"\n\nSanjay Verma, India's high commissioner to Canada, stated that India intends to get frequent information from Canadian authorities on the three imprisoned Indians. \"I hear that the arrests were made following investigations by the appropriate Canadian law enforcement organisations. This is an internal issue in Canada, so we have no comments,\" Verma added.\n\nNijjar, 45, was fatally shot outside a gurdwara in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a sizable Sikh community.

They have been charged with first-degree murder, court records show, as well as conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nAll had been in Canada for three to five years, police said.\n\nPolice added that investigations were continuing, including into \"connections to the government of India\".\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters. Certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today,\" Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said.\n\nInvestigators have been working with counterparts in India but the collaboration has been \"rather difficult and rather challenging\" for several years, they said\n\nPolice said there may be others involved in the killing, and there may be further arrests or charges.\n\nMr Nijjar was a Sikh separatist leader who publicly campaigned for Khalistan - the creation of an independent Sikh homeland in the Punjab region of India.\n\nIn the 1970s, Sikhs launched a separatist insurgency in India which saw thousands killed before it was quelled the following decade. Since then, the movement has been mostly limited to countries with large Sikh populations.\n\nIndia has in the past described Mr Nijjar as a terrorist who led a militant separatist group - accusations his supporters say are unfounded. They say he had received threats in the past because of his activism.\n\nHe was shot dead at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, a city about 30km (18 miles) east of Vancouver on 18 June last year.\n\nThose close to him have said he was warned by Canadian intelligence services before his death that he was on a \"hit list\" and there had been threats on his life.\n\nMoninder Singh, a member of the British Columbia Gurdwaras Council who was friends with Mr Nijjar for 15 years, told BBC News that the Sikh community was grateful to see progress in the investigation.\n\nHowever he said there were still \"public safety concerns\" and \"a lot of tension. There's frustration. And there's a hope, as well.\"\n\nThree months after he was killed, Mr Trudeau, standing in the House of Commons, said Canada was looking at \"credible allegations potentially linking\" the Indian state to the killing.\n\nThe allegation had been strongly denied by Indian officials, who accused Canada of providing shelter to \"Khalistani terrorists and extremists\".\n\nThe row between the two countries led Delhi to ask Ottawa to reduce the number of envoys it had in India.\n\nMr Trudeau has also faced pressure to provide evidence for his allegation of Delhi's involvement.\n\nBiden meeting

Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday, the report said.\n\nNijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen, was shot dead on June 18, shortly after evening prayers at his Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan people.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a \"problem\" and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n\"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n\"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIn his comments to the media, Trudeau, referring to activities by pro-Khalistani elements, said that \"our job is not to crack down on political protest\".\n\nIndia on Monday summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-'Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n\"It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,\" Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh alleges India's hand in Nijjar killing despite no evidence", "body": "PTC Web Desk: The leader of Canada's New Democratic Party (NDP), Jagmeet Singh, has once again alleged the Indian government's involvement in the killing of Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar, despite a lack of evidence linking India to the crime. Jagmeet Singh's NDP has formed an alliance with the Liberal minority government, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in exchange for support on key legislative initiatives.\n\nFollowing the announcement by the Canadian police of the arrest of three suspects in Hardeep Nijjar's killing, Jagmeet Singh reiterated his claim of the Indian government's involvement. In a post on X, Singh said, \"The Indian government hired assassins to murder a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil - at a place of worship. Today 3 arrests were made. Let me be clear - any Indian agent or state actor that ordered, planned or carried out this murder must be exposed and met with the full force of Canadian law. For Canada, democracy and free speech - there must be Justice for Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\"\n\nLast year, Prime Minister Trudeau also alleged Indian involvement in the killing, a claim vehemently denied by India as \"absurd and motivated.\" The Canadian police have not provided any evidence of Indian involvement, contrary to speculation in Canadian media.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) released photographs of the three arrested individuals, identified as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22, and Karan Brar, 22, all Indian nationals. They were apprehended in Edmonton City, Alberta, and charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in connection with Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing in June 2023 in Surrey, British Columbia.\n\nAddressing reporters, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder, stating, \"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of the evidence or the motive of the murder... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation.\"\n\nTeboul also mentioned ongoing investigations into potential connections to the government of India. Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc refrained from confirming any such connection, stating that inquiries should be directed to the RCMP.\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar was fatally shot outside a gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A video purportedly showing his killing emerged in March this year, depicting Hardeep Singh Nijjar being shot by armed individuals in what has been described as a \"contract killing.\"", "source": {"uri": "ptcnews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "PTC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagmeet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jagmeet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardeep_Singh_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hardeep Singh (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_LeBlanc", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominic LeBlanc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.ptcnews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2658d6d6ab4b2da1900e945aad29d60b_1280X720.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

He was shot down by masked gunmen outside Vancouver, police said.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sparked a diplomatic feud with India in September when he said that there were \"credible allegations\" of Indian involvement in the slaying of Nijjar.\n\nIndia had accused Nijjar of links to terrorism, but angrily denied involvement in the slaying. In response to the allegations, India told Canada last year to remove 41 of its 62 diplomats in the country.

But he had denied allegations of ties to terrorism.\n\nA bloody decadelong Sikh insurgency shook north India in the 1970s and 1980s, until it was crushed in a government crackdown in which thousands of people were killed, including prominent Sikh leaders.\n\nThe Khalistan movement has lost much of its political power but still has supporters in the Indian state of Punjab, as well as in the sizable overseas Sikh diaspora. While the active insurgency ended years ago, the Indian government has warned repeatedly that Sikh separatists were trying to make a comeback.\n\nSeparatists in the diaspora, including in California, they say their efforts are limited to peaceful protest and referendums to show support for an independent Khalistan.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikh_diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sikh diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0004af0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+193/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2Fec%2Fc69ba2331e2fb2a7fff564b46974%2F4a83d9d2b594459f93332df35b1d1550", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

A US indictment unsealed in November accused an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, of trying to kill Pannun, who is a wanted man in India and considered a terrorist by the government.\n\nUS prosecutors say Gupta was acting on orders from an unnamed Indian government official. India's government has denied any involvement in the alleged plot to kill Pannun.\n\nJust one day after Nijjar was killed in Canada, US prosecutors say Gupta allegedly told an undercover law enforcement official posing as a hitman that Nijjar had also been one of his targets.\n\n\"We have so many targets,\" Gupta allegedly said.\n\nNijjar's assassination has sent a chill through Sikh activists living abroad. Dr. Pritpal Singh, an American citizen who heads the American Sikh Caucus Committee, told CNN he was alerted with a \"duty to warn\" by the FBI of a threat to his life after the Canadian's assassination.\n\nHe commended Canadian law enforcement for its \"dedication to upholding justice by rigorously pursuing those responsible for these crimes\" in a statement, adding that \"we, as a

But it garners a level of public sympathy among some in the Sikh diaspora overseas, where activists protected by free speech laws can more openly demand secession from India.\n\nWeeks after Trudeau's announcement, the United States accused an Indian government official of being involved in a conspiracy to kill another Sikh separatist, American citizen Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, on US soil. A US indictment unsealed in November accused an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, of trying to kill Pannun, who is a wanted man in India and considered to be a terrorist by the government.\n\nUS prosecutors say Gupta was acting on orders from an unnamed Indian government official. India's government has denied any involvement in the alleged plot to kill Pannun.\n\nJust one day after Nijjar was killed in Canada, US prosecutors say Gupta allegedly told an undercover law enforcement official posing as a hitman that Nijjar had also been one of his targets.\n\n\"We have so many targets,\" Gupta allegedly said.\n\nNijjar's assassination has sent a chill through Sikh activists living abroad. Dr. Pritpal Singh, an American citizen who heads the American Sikh Caucus Committee, told CNN he was alerted with a \"duty to warn\" by the FBI of a threat to his life after the Canadian's assassination.\n\nHe commended Canadian law enforcement for its \"dedication to upholding justice by rigorously pursuing those responsible for these crimes\" in a statement, adding that \"we, as a community, stand firm in demanding accountability and will continue to advocate for justice to ensure such reprehensible actions are addressed decisively.\"\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

In September 2023, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said that the Indian government had told Canada that it was not Government of India policy to engage in such acts like the killing of Nijjar\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar.... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nThe indictments allege that the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023, and the day of Nijjar's killing.\n\nScheduled updates on the case from the BC RCMP and the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team were announced for 12:30 pm PT on Friday.\n\nNijjar's assassination triggered diplomatic tensions between Canada and India after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau disclosed intelligence investigations regarding a potential link between the Indian government and the killing.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc refrained from confirming any connection to the Indian government, asserting that such inquiries should be directed to the RCMP, as reported by CTV News.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc affirmed.\n\n\"The police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added.\n\nNijjar, who was designated a terrorist by the National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on the evening of June 18, 2023.\n\nThe video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March recently, showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a 'contract killing'.\n\nThe killing led to accusations from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the government of India had a hand in the killing -- a claim that was denied by India and led to the deterioration of diplomatic ties between Canada and India.

The police are expected to share details later Friday (local time). Nijjar was killed outside the Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18.\n\nAlso Read | Hardeep Singh Nijjar Killing: Canadian Police Arrest Three Suspects in Killing of Khalistan Separatist, Says Media Report.\n\nThe CBC report further claimed that the \"arrested men could be part of an alleged hit squad tasked by the government of India.\" This charge has been repeatedly denied by India. In September 2023, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said that the Indian government had told Canada that it was not Government of India policy to engage in such acts like the killing of Hardeep Nijjar\n\nIn its report on Friday, CBC news further quoted sources, saying that the arrested men arrived in Canada on temporary visas after 2021. They are said to be alleged associates of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who is currently under arrest in India. Bishnoi is accused of plotting the killing of popular singer Sidhu Moose Wala in May 2022.\n\nAlso Read | Bomb Blast in Pakistan: Three Killed, Eight Injured in Explosion in Khuzdar District of Balochistan Province.\n\nAccording to another Canadian news outlet, CTV news, court documents show the three arrested as Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh and Karan Brar. They face one count of first degree murder and a count of conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nThe arrests come in the backdrop of frayed relationship between India and Canada. Last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had alleged that there was an Indian government hand behind the killing of Nijjar, a charge that the Indian government had vehemently denied, calling it absurd.\n\nEarlier this month, purported video footage of the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar surfaced, showing Nijjar being shot by armed men. Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by the National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia. The attack was described as 'highly coordinated' and involved six men and two vehicles.\n\nThe India-Canada relationship continues to be troubled. On May 2, the Ministry of External Affairs condemned pro-Khalistan slogans at a public event attended by Justin Trudeau, and stressed that this shows the kind of political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nDuring the weekly briefing, the MEA spokesperson said, \"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well...His remarks illustrate once again the kind of political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.

India has denied the allegations.\n\nThe three suspects have been identified as Karan Brar, 22, Kamal Preet Singh, 22, and Karan Preet Singh, 28, Royal Canadian Mounted Police superintendent Mandeep Mooker said on Friday.\n\nAll three suspects were arrested from Alberta, where they lived as non-permanent residents for at least three to five years.\n\nThey have been charged with first-degree murder as well as conspiracy to commit murder, according to court documents.\n\n\"We are investigating whether there are any ties to the government of India,\" Mr Mooker said, adding that it was an \"ongoing investigation\".\n\nAssistant commissioner David Teboul said Canadian authorities were speaking to counterparts in India. \"I would characterise that collaboration as rather challenging,\" he said.\n\n\"It's been very difficult.\"\n\nThe three men were expected to be transported to British Columbia by Monday to face charges.\n\nNijjar, an Indian-born citizen of Canada, was a plumber and also a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland, known as Khalistan. The Sikh secessionist movement calls for a separate homeland for the Sikh religious community to be carved out of India's Punjab state.\n\nNijjar was accused of leading a proscribed militant organisation called the Khalistan Tiger Force, but he had denied allegations of ties to terrorism.\n\nThree months after his death, Mr Trudeau claimed the Indian government could be behind the killing of Nijjar, which worsened already faltering bilateral ties.\n\n\"Any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty,\" Mr Trudeau said in parliament.\n\nIndia rejected Canada's \"absurd and motivated\" allegations while accusing the Trudeau government of allowing the Khalistan movement to thrive. In response to the allegations, India told Canada last year to remove 41 of its 62 diplomats in the country. Tensions remain but have somewhat eased since.\n\nMoninder Singh, a friend of Nijjar, said the arrests were \"bittersweet\".\n\n\"It's a relief that the investigation is moving forward. At the same time, it's still raising a lot of questions,\" Mr Singh, a spokesperson for the BC Gurdwaras Council, told Reuters.\n\nBalpreet Singh, legal counsel for the World Sikh Organisation, said: \"I think that Canada has been soft on Indian interference for the past four decades.

The RCMP said that the force is still \"investigating connections to the government of India.\"\n\nIndia's take on the matter\n\nEarlier today, External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said that New Delhi will wait for the Canadian police to share information on the three men who were arrested and charged.\n\nJaishankar noted that he had seen news of the arrests and the fact that the suspects \"apparently are Indians of some kind of gang background &mldr; we'll have to wait for the police to tell us.\"\n\n\"But, as I said, one of our concerns which we have been telling them is that, you know, they have allowed organized crime from India, specifically from Punjab, to operate in Canada,\" he said.\n\nWhile addressing an event in Odisha, the EAM also took time to criticize the Canadian government for allowing people with links to organized crime into the country.\n\n\"Our biggest problem right now is in Canada, because in Canada, actually today the party in power in Canada &mldr; [has] given these kind of extremism, separatism, advocates of violence a certain legitimacy in the name of free speech,\" Jaishankar said.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanjay Verma, India's high commissioner to Canada said that New Delhi is hoping for regular updates from the Canadian authorities regarding the arrests of the three men.\n\n\"I understand that the arrests have been made as a result of investigations conducted by the relevant Canadian law enforcement agencies. This issue is internal to Canada and therefore we have no comments to offer in this regard,\" Verma averred.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karan Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamalpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamalpreet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

None pursued education while in in the country and none have permanent residency, according to the CBC.\n\nInvestigators say the group could also be tied to three other murders in Canada, including the \"sick and twisted\" killing of an 11-year-old boy in the city of Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the group, alleged to be the gunmen and drivers responsible for the brazen 18 June killing of Nijjar, were arrested in police raids in at least two provinces.\n\nThe British Columbia RCMP and the integrated homicide investigation team expected to provide an update on the arrests update later on Friday.",

The killing sent diplomatic relations between Ottawa and New Delhi into a tailspin last autumn after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were \"credible allegations\" linking Indian intelligence to the crime.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday acknowledged fear in Canada's Sikh community but underscored the \"rule of law\" after three arrests in connection with last year's killing of a Sikh separatist in Vancouver. Speaking Saturday at a gala in Toronto to celebrate Sikh heritage and culture, Trudeau acknowledged that many in Canada's Sikh community are \"feeling uneasy, and perhaps even frightened right now,\" but urged faith in the justice system.\n\n\"Let us remain calm and remain steadfast in our commitment to our democratic principles and our system of justice,\" he said. Trudeau said the arrests were \"important because Canada is a rule of law country with a strong and independent justice system, as well as a fundamental commitment to protecting all its citizens.\"\n\nIndia vehemently rejected the allegations as \"absurd\", halting the processing of visas for a time and forcing Canada to significantly reduce its diplomatic presence in the country. \"It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India,\" the Press Trust of India news agency quoted External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as saying on Saturday. Thousands of people were killed in the 1980s during a separatist insurgency aimed at creating a Sikh homeland known as Khalistan, which was put down by security forces.\n\nThe movement has largely petered out within India, but in the Sikh diaspora -- whose largest community is in Canada, with around 770,000 people -- it retains support among a vocal minority. New Delhi has sought to persuade Ottawa not to grant Sikh separatists visas or political legitimacy, Jaishankar said, since they are \"causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship\". He added that Canada does not \"share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us\".\n\nNijjar immigrated to Canada in 1997 and acquired citizenship 18 years later. He was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder. On June 18, 2023, he was shot dead by masked assailants in the parking lot of the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver. Trudeau announced several months later that Canada had \"credible allegations\" linking Indian intelligence to the killing and expelled an Indian official, touching off a diplomatic tit-for-tat with New Delhi. India dismissed the allegations as \"absurd\" and responded furiously, briefly curbing visas for Canadians and forcing Ottawa to withdraw diplomats.\n\nThe three arrested Indian nationals, all in their twenties, were charged with first degree murder and conspiracy. They were accused of being the shooter, driver and lookout in his killing last June. The Canadian police said they were aware that \"others may have played a role\" in the murder. In November, the US Justice Department charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with plotting a similar assassination attempt on another Sikh separatist leader on American soil.\n\nA Washington Post investigation reported last week that Indian foreign intelligence officials were involved in the plot, a claim rejected by New Delhi.

Jaishankar as saying on May 4.\n\nThousands of people were killed in the 1980s during a separatist insurgency aimed at creating a Sikh homeland known as Khalistan, which was put down by security forces.\n\nThe movement has largely petered out within India, but in the Sikh diaspora - whose largest community is in Canada, with around 770,000 people - it retains support among a vocal minority.\n\nNew Delhi has sought to persuade Ottawa not to grant Sikh separatists visas or political legitimacy, Dr Jaishankar said, since they are \"causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship\".\n\nHe added that Canada does not \"share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us\".\n\nNijjar immigrated to Canada in 1997 and acquired citizenship 18 years later. He was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nThe three arrested Indian nationals, all in their 20s, were charged with first degree murder and conspiracy.\n\nThey were accused of being the shooter, driver and lookout in the killing last June.\n\nThe Canadian police said they were aware that \"others may have played a role\" in the murder.\n\nIn November, the US Justice Department charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with plotting a similar assassination attempt on another Sikh separatist leader on American soil.\n\nA Washington Post investigation reported last week that Indian foreign intelligence officials were involved in the plot, a claim rejected by New Delhi.

They are accused of being shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed.\n\nCBC said police were also investigating possible links to three more murders, including of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton. Police are reportedly set to hold a press conference later Friday.\n\nNijjar, who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015, advocated for a separate Sikh state carved out of India.\n\nHe was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nLast June, he was shot dead by masked assailants in the parking lot of a Sikh temple near the west coast city of Vancouver.\n\nTrudeau announced several months later that Canada had \"credible allegations\" linking Indian intelligence to the killing and expelled an Indian official, spurring the diplomatic tit-for-tat with New Delhi.\n\nIn November, the US Justice Department charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on American soil.\n\nProsecutors said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning.\n\nThe shock allegations came after US President Joe Biden hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a rare state visit, as Washington seeks closer ties with India against growing China's growing influence.\n\nUS intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India's top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, the Washington Post reported this week.\n\nCanada is home to some 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two percent of the country's population, with a vocal minority calling for creating a separate state of Khalistan.\n\nThe Sikh separatist movement is largely finished within India, where security forces used deadly force to put down an insurgency in the state of Punjab in the 1980s.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

He was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India.\n\nSept. 1, 2023: A Canadian trade official says Canada paused talks on a proposed trade treaty with India, an unexpected move that came about three months after both countries said they planned to seal an initial pact this year.\n\nSept. 10, 2023: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveys strong concerns about Sikh separatist protests in Canada to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the sidelines of a G20 summit in New Delhi.\n\nSept. 18, 2023: Trudeau tells parliament that Canada was \"actively pursuing credible allegations\" linking Indian government agents to the killing of Nijjar.\n\nSept. 19, 2023: India dismisses Trudeau's assertion as \"absurd\". Each country expels a diplomat in tit-for-tat moves, with Canada throwing out India's top intelligence officer in the country while India expelled his Canadian counterpart.\n\nSept. 22, 2023: India suspends issuing new visas for Canadians and asks Ottawa to reduce its diplomatic presence in India. India resumes issuing visas two months later.\n\nOct. 29, 2023: Tens of thousands of Sikhs turn out in Surrey, British Columbia, at the same gurdwara where Nijjar was killed to vote in an unofficial referendum on the creation of an independent Sikh state.\n\nNov. 21, 2024: India's anti-terror agency files a case against Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist, stating that he warned Air India passengers in video messages shared on social media that their lives were in danger.\n\nNov. 22, 2024: A senior Biden administration official says U.S. authorities thwarted a plot to kill Pannun in the United States and issued a warning to India over concerns the government in New Delhi was involved.\n\nFeb. 5, 2024: India's High Commissioner says in an interview with Canada's Globe & Mail newspaper that India will not provide information to Canadian investigators over Nijjar's murder until Canada shares evidence.\n\nApril 30, 2024: The White House describes as a serious matter a Washington Post report that an officer in India's intelligence service was directly involved in both Nijjar's killing and the foiled plot to kill Pannun in the U.S.\n\nIndia said the report contained \"unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribuneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This development unfolds amidst continuing inquiries into alleged links with the Indian government.\n\nAs per court records cited by Canadian news outlet CTV News, Karanpreet Singh (28), Kamalpreet Singh (22), and Karan Brar (22) are each accused of one count of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in relation to Nijjar's demise.\n\nHowever, India has consistently refuted this accusation. In September 2023, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stated that the Indian government had informed Canada that it is not part of the Government of India's policy to engage in actions such as the killing of Nijjar.\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, head of the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, underscored the ongoing and intensive nature of the investigation into Nijjar's homicide.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar.... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nThe indictments allege that the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023, and the day of Nijjar's killing. Scheduled updates on the case from the BC RCMP and the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team were announced for 12:30 pm PT on Friday.\n\nNijjar's assassination triggered diplomatic tensions between Canada and India after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau disclosed intelligence investigations regarding a potential link between the Indian government and the killing.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc refrained from confirming any connection to the Indian government, asserting that such inquiries should be directed to the RCMP, as reported by CTV News.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc affirmed.\n\n\"The police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added.\n\nNijjar, who was designated a terrorist by the National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on the evening of June 18, 2023.\n\nThe video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March recently, showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a 'contract killing'.\n\nThe killing led to accusations from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the government of India had a hand in the killing -- a claim that was denied by India and led to the deterioration of diplomatic ties between Canada and India.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

Local media reported his death had been linked to the Indian government, local media reported.\n\nThe killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, which Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly linked to Indian intelligence, ignited a diplomatic firestorm between the two countries. India dismissed the allegations as \"absurd\" and responded furiously, briefly curbing visas for Canadians and forcing Ottawa to withdraw diplomats.\n\nAccording to documents submitted in a Western Canadian court, the three arrested are accused of being shooters, drivers, and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed. CBC said police were also investigating possible links to three more murders, including of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton. Police are reportedly set to hold a press conference later Friday.\n\nNijjar, who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015, advocated for a separate Sikh state carved out of India. He was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder. Last June, he was shot dead by masked assailants in the parking lot of a Sikh temple near the west coast city of Vancouver.\n\nTrudeau announced several months later that Canada had \"credible allegations\" linking Indian intelligence to the killing and expelled an Indian official, spurring the diplomatic tit-for-tat with New Delhi. In November, the US Justice Department charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on American soil. Prosecutors said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning.\n\nThe shock allegations came after US President Joe Biden hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a rare state visit, as Washington seeks closer ties with India against growing China's growing influence. US intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India's top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, the Washington Post reported this week.\n\nCanada is home to some 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two percent of the country's population, with a vocal minority calling for creating a separate state of Khalistan. The Sikh separatist movement is largely finished within India, where security forces used deadly force to put down an insurgency in the state of Punjab in the 1980s.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr",

The trio were arrested in Edmonton city in Alberta.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of Surrey, RCMP on Friday (local time) said that on the morning of May 3, IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta RCMP and the Edmonton Police Service, arrested the three men for the June 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey a suburb in Vancouver.\n\nThe trio have now been charged with first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the homicide.\n\nAlong with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police has also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar.... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc refrained from confirming any connection to the Indian government, asserting that such inquiries should be directed to the RCMP, CTV News report.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc said.\n\n\"The police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added, according to CTV News report.\n\nPolice personnel have not given any evidence of any link to India as was being speculated in Canadian media. India has repeatedly denied the allegations, terming them \"absurd and motivated.\"\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Surrey RCMP received a report of a shooting at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey. First responding members located a man, later identified as Hardeep Singh Nijjar, suffering from fatal gunshot wounds inside a vehicle.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) has been carrying out the investigation. It has continued to work closely with a number of partner agencies and support services across Canada, as far east as Ontario, including the Surrey RCMP, the Alberta RCMP and other Lower Mainland Integrated Teams.\n\nThe Canadian police have not given any evidence of any link to India as was being speculated in Canadian media.\n\nNijjar's killing triggered diplomatic tensions between Canada and India after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of being involved in the killing -- a claim which India has rejected as \"absurd.\"\n\nThe video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March this year showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a \"contract killing\".

In response to the allegatio ns, India told Canada last year to remove 41 of its 62 diplomats in the country.

Mandeep Mooker of IHIT shared in an update to media on Friday at a press conference at BC RCMP Headquarters in Surrey.\n\nNijjar was shot to death on June 18, 2023 in the parking lot of Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey's Newton neighbourhood just before 8:30 p.m. The 45-year-old, who was the temple president at the time, was found in his truck suffering from gunshot wounds. Nijjar succumbed to his injuries at the scene.\n\nAssistant commissioner David Teboul, commander of the federal policing program in the Pacific region, said police would not be able to speak about the \"nature of the evidence\" collected by police, nor the motive behind the killing.\n\n\"I will say this matter is still very much under active investigation,\" he said. \"I will underscore that today's announcements are not a complete account of the investigative work currently underway.\"\n\nPolice would not speak to whether any of the three charged have involvement in gang activity in India.\n\nWhile three people have been charged, Mooker said investigators believe there may be more individuals involved who are still at large.\n\nDays after the shooting, Sgt. Timothy Pierotti of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) shared details of two suspects. According to investigators, the suspects -- who were wearing face coverings -- ran southbound on 122 Street, through Cougar Creek Park and onto 121 Street after the incident. A getaway vehicle was possibly waiting for them upon their arrival.\n\nREAD MORE: Two heavy-set suspects ran through park after Surrey temple president's shooting, IHIT says\n\nAccording to the Nijjar family, the temple president had been meeting with Canadian Security Intelligence Service officers regularly before his death, as threats against him were mounting. Balraj Nijjar said his father was told about the threats and was advised to stay home.\n\nNijjar was also a vocal advocate for the Khalistan movement, which advocates for a separate Sikh homeland in Punjab, India, which led to accusations against him of terrorism and separatism by the government.\n\nREAD MORE: CSIS warned B.C. Sikh temple leader of assassination threat before killing: lawyer\n\nREAD MORE: Nijjar, CSIS met regularly before he was killed in Surrey, son says\n\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun, a close associate of Nijjar's, said Nijjar had asked authorities for a bulletproof vest weeks before he was killed but was told they could not provide one. The president was also told to avoid going to the gurdwara at his usual times and should avoid being seen in public, Pannun said.\n\nBut Balraj said his father did not want to hide.\n\nWhile the Indian government has denied involvement in Nijjar's death, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in September 2023 that there was \"credible\" information linking India to the killing.\n\nAt the Friday afternoon media conference, police said the claim of an Indian government link remains under investigation.\n\nSurrey Mayor Brenda Locke, in a statement issued May 3, urged the federal government to \"take every opportunity to determine if there was foreign government involvement in the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.\"\n\n\"That question needs to be answered given the circumstances surrounding Mr. Nijjar's murder,\" she said.\n\nPolice noted the death of Nijjar was shocking and troubling to the Sikh community, not just around Surrey but all throughout the country.\n\n\"We would not be at this point without the bravery and courage of the Sikh community coming forward for Hardeep Nijjar's murder investigation,\" Mooker shared, adding the community was \"instrumental\" in the investigation.\n\n- with files from Canadian Press, Black Press Media staff", "source": {"uri": "surreynowleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Surrey

This development comes after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's accusations in September last year, suggesting the \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in Nijjar's killing, which significantly strained relations between India and Canada.\n\nIndia has rejected Trudeau's accusations as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Assistant Commissioner David Teboul confirmed the arrest and charging of three individuals in the killing of activist Nijjar.\n\nAccording to court documents, Karanpreet Singh (28), Kamalpreet Singh (22), and Karan Brar (22) have been charged with first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to murder in Nijjar's death. The three men, who were arrested on Friday, were residing in the city of Edmonton, Alberta. They are scheduled to be transported on Monday to British Columbia to face the charges. The indictments state that the conspiracy was planned in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1 and June 18.\n\nThe arrests come nearly a year after the activist was killed in the parking lot of the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara on the evening of June 18 in the city of Surrey, British Columbia. Investigators previously described the incident as a carefully orchestrated operation, with two assailants firing approximately 50 bullets at Nijjar before fleeing the area in a grey car.\n\nDuring the press conference, Superintendent Mandeep Mooker, who leads the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team, stated that the suspects, identified as Karan Brar, Karanpreet Singh, and Kamalpreet Singh, all men in their 20s, were not previously known to the police before the investigation into Nijjar's death. The three individuals were apprehended on Friday (May 03) in Edmonton.\n\nMooker revealed that all three suspects are Indian nationals and have been residing in Canada as non-permanent residents for the past three to five years. He acknowledged that coordination with India has been challenging in recent years. Mooker emphasized that the investigation has relied on the support of the Sikh community.\n\n\"We would not be at this point without the bravery and courage of the Sikh community coming forward with information for this investigation,\" he said, adding that he believes they will continue to come forward for any future investigations, according to the report.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karan Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamalpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamalpreet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guru Nanak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01hx0katzs3tmbxgk9c3y66336/hardeep-singh-nijjar.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "dateEnd": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1173, "textEnd": 1190}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1323, "textEnd": 1330}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1925, "textEnd": 1931}], "sentiment": -0.584313725490196, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Modi's administration of orchestrating the killing, prompting India to dismiss the allegation as \"absurd\" and expel dozens of Canadian diplomats.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police revealed Friday that three Indian citizens living in Edmonton had been arrested. Karan Brar and Kamalpreet Singh, both 22, and Karanpreet Singh, 28, have each been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nThe men - all temporary residents of Canada who have been in the country for three to five years - were taken into custody in Edmonton. They are accused of driving from Edmonton to Surrey - about a 700-mile distance, or 12 hours on the road - to commit the killing before returning to the Alberta city.\n\nPolice said there are several investigations underway, including probes into a connection to the Indian government, but provided few details about that alleged link. Officers said they are in constant collaboration with domestic and international agencies, including those in the US.\n\n\"We believe that there may be others involved and therefore there may be potential arrests or charges for others as well,\" said Supt. Mandeep Mooker of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team.\n\nIn September, Trudeau publicly described \"credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India\" and the killing, prompting a row between the two countries. The prime minister and other Canadian officials largely fell silent about the killing since then, saying they would wait for Canada's police and justice system to investigate the matter.\n\nThe police did not give a clear indication on Friday of how fully India has been cooperating with their investigation.\n\nDavid Teboul, assistant commissioner for the RCMP, said he has been collaborating with his Indian counterparts on this and other investigations, but he described that work as \"rather challenging and difficult for the last several years.\"\n\nRead More: Aftermath of an Assassination: Inside the India-Canada Crisis\n\nA few months after Trudeau's accusation, US court documents revealed American authorities had thwarted an alleged assassination attempt against a Sikh activist in New York, and were seeking to extradite the suspect from the Czech Republic.\n\nProsecutors in that case allege the hitman was recruited by an agent who was \"employed at all times relevant to this Indictment by the Indian government, resides in India, and directed the assassination plot from India.\" Last week the Washington Post reported American officials believe the operation was approved by senior-level members of India's intelligence agency, including its chief at the time.\n\nNijjar, 45, was an outspoken voice in a movement to carve out a separate state in India for Sikhs called Khalistan, which the Indian government deems a terrorist threat.\n\nDanish Singh, president of the World Sikh Organization of Canada, said in a statement that he welcomes the arrests but believes they \"raise disturbing questions about the nexus between the government of India and criminal gangs.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [],

They have been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in the killing of British Columbia Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Integrated Homicide Investigation Team **MANDATORY CREDIT**SURREY, B.C. - Three suspects accused of murdering British Columbia Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year are scheduled to appear in court in Surrey on Tuesday. Indian nationals Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh, and Karan Brar are due to face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder at Surrey Provincial Court. Their arrests in Edmonton were announced on Friday in the killing of Nijjar in June last year outside the Surrey gurdwara where he was president. The killing of Nijjar, who campaigned for a separate Sikh homeland known as Khalistan, threw Canada's relationship with India into disarray after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons that credible intelligence suggested India's government was behind his death. Indictments for the three suspects allege that from May 1 last year they conspired in Surrey and Edmonton to kill Nijjar, while the murder counts say all three used a firearm in the killing. India has repeatedly denied involvement in the death of Nijjar, who was shot dead in his pickup truck as he left his temple's parking lot. India's foreign affairs minister accused Canada over the weekend of welcoming criminals from his country. Speaking in response to the arrests, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said \"wanted criminals\" from India and \"people with organized crime links from Punjab\" had been let into Canada.

'rule of law' after arrests in Sikh separatist murder", "body": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday acknowledged fear in Canada's Sikh community but underscored the \"rule of law\" after three arrests in connection with last year's killing of a Sikh separatist in Vancouver.\n\nPolice arrested three men on Friday for the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, which triggered a diplomatic rift between Canada and India last fall after Trudeau suggested Indian government involvement in the homicide.\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nSpeaking Saturday at a gala in Toronto to celebrate Sikh heritage and culture, Trudeau acknowledged that many in Canada's Sikh community are \"feeling uneasy, and perhaps even frightened right now,\" but urged faith in the justice system.\n\n\"Let us remain calm and us remain steadfast in our commitment to our democratic principles and our system of justice,\" he said.\n\nTrudeau said the arrests were \"important because Canada is a rule of law country with a strong and independent justice system, as well as a fundamental commitment to protecting all its citizens.\"\n\nThree Indian nationals, two aged 22 and one aged 28, were arrested Friday on first-degree murder and conspiracy charges.\n\nThey are accused of being the shooter, driver and lookout on the day Nijjar was killed.\n\nPolice said they were still investigating the ties of the suspects, \"if any, to the Indian government,\" and whether others may have been involved.\n\nNijjar -- who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 -- advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India.\n\nHe was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, he was shot dead by masked assailants in the parking lot of the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver.\n\nTrudeau announced several months later that Canada had \"credible allegations\" linking Indian intelligence to the killing and expelled an Indian official, touching off a diplomatic tit-for-tat with New Delhi.\n\nIndia dismissed the allegations as \"absurd\" and responded furiously, briefly curbing visas for Canadians and forcing Ottawa to withdraw diplomats.\n\nIn November, the US Justice Department charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on American soil.\n\nRead more:\n\nCanada arrests three over killing of Sikh separatist: Report", "source": {"uri":

Police say they were arrested in Edmonton where they live without incident Friday morning.\n\n\"After 10 months of waiting for the family and the community, it's a very positive step,\" said B.C. Gurdwaras Council spokesperson Moninder Singh. \"We've been waiting for this day to better understand what has been happening.\"\n\nPolice say all three men are Indian nationals. CBC has learned at least two came to Canada as international students.\n\n\"There's some relief but there are a lot of questions still, particularly around ... who ordered [the killing], where does this connect back to India and who was involved,\" said Singh.\n\nCourt documents say the conspiracy to murder took place from May 1 to June 18 last year, at or near Surrey and Edmonton.\n\nNijjar, 45, was gunned down in the parking lot of the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara on 120 Street in Surrey's Newton neighbourhood on June 18.\n\nThe arrests take place against a backdrop of national security tensions between Canada and India.\n\nRCMP Asst. Commissioner David Teboul said co-operating police agencies are conducting \"separate and distinct investigations\" related to Nijjar's killing, including looking into the involvement of the government of India.\n\nHe said Canadian law enforcement continues to liaise with agencies from other countries, but described the relationship with the national police of India as being \"rather challenging and difficult.\"\n\nAt a press conference in Surrey, Sikh leaders squarely placed the blame for Nijjar's killing on \"transnational repression\" by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"Canadian politicians of every stripe must stand with the Canadian Sikhs' right to peacefully advocate for a Khalistan without facing any violent retaliation from the Indian government,\" said Bhupinder Hothi, general secretary of the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara Society.\n\nFormer B.C. solicitor general Kash Heed said an outstanding question in the police investigation is proving to whom the murderers are linked.\n\n\"The interesting part is whether [investigators] were able to just get the hired hitmen ... and whether they will be able to now link that right back to whether it's a gang in India or it's the Indian government,\" said Heed, who is also a former West Vancouver police chief.\n\nThe three men charged are expected to be transferred to B.C. by Monday morning, according to Integrated Homicide Investigation Team Supt. Mandeep Mooker.\n\nMooker said information and co-operation from the Sikh community had greatly aided the investigation.\n\n\"We would not be at this point without the bravery and courage of the Sikh community coming forward,\" he said.\n\nSources close to the investigation told CBC News that police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the

The trio were arrested in Edmonton city in Alberta.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of Surrey, RCMP on Friday (local time) said that on the morning of May 3, IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta RCMP and the Edmonton Police Service, arrested the three men for the June 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey a suburb in Vancouver.\n\nThe trio have now been charged with first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the homicide.\n\nAlong with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police has also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar.... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc refrained from confirming any connection to the Indian government, asserting that such inquiries should be directed to the RCMP, CTV News report.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc said.\n\n\"The police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added, according to CTV News report.\n\nPolice personnel have not given any evidence of any link to India as was being speculated in Canadian media. India has repeatedly denied the allegations, terming them \"absurd and motivated.\" Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Surrey RCMP received a report of a shooting at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey. First responding members located a man, later identified as Hardeep Singh Nijjar, suffering from fatal gunshot wounds inside a vehicle.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) has been carrying out the investigation. It has continued to work closely with a number of partner agencies and support services across Canada, as far east as Ontario, including the Surrey RCMP, the Alberta RCMP and other Lower Mainland Integrated Teams.\n\nThe Canadian police have not given any evidence of any link to India as was being speculated in Canadian media.\n\nNijjar's killing triggered diplomatic tensions between Canada and India after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of being involved in the killing -- a claim which India has rejected as \"absurd.\" The video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March this year showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a \"contract killing\".", "source": {"uri": "tribuneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

These individuals are suspected of being part of an alleged hit squad, reportedly directed by the Indian government, to assassinate Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey last year. This incident has escalated tensions following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations against India's involvement in Nijjar's murder in September of the previous year, which India has vehemently denied, labeling the accusations as baseless and politically motivated.\n\nAccording to CTV News, citing a senior government source, the individuals arrested have been identified as Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh, and Karan Brar. Each faces charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in connection with Nijjar's death. Court documents reveal that Nijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen, was fatally shot outside his gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., on June 18, 2023. Global News reported that the suspects were Indian nationals who had entered Canada on student visas but are suspected of operating under instructions from Indian intelligence.\n\nThe charges against Brar include involvement in a murder that took place in Surrey on June 18, 2023, along with a conspiracy to commit murder charge dating back to May 1, 2023, in Edmonton and Surrey. The indictment suggests that the conspiracy spanned both locations from May 1 until Nijjar's assassination. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) has reported that police are investigating potential connections between the suspects and three additional murders in Canada, including the tragic death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nOn the day of Nijjar's killing at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, members of the alleged hit squad are said to have performed various roles including shooters, drivers, and spotters. These arrests were made during police operations across at least two provinces. Sources indicate that these individuals had been identified by investigators months prior and were under close surveillance.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are expected to provide further details on their investigation following these arrests. This comes after India's strong rejection of Prime Minister Trudeau's recent comments on Nijjar's killing. External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal criticized Trudeau's remarks for providing political space to separatism and extremism within Canada, which he argued not only affects India-Canada relations but also fosters a climate of violence detrimental to Canadian society itself.\n\nIndia's response to Trudeau's allegations included summoning the Canadian deputy high commissioner to express a strong protest over pro-Khalistan slogans raised at a Khalsa Day event attended by Trudeau among other leaders. Following these developments, India requested Canada to reduce its diplomatic presence in India for parity, leading to Canada withdrawing 41 diplomats and their family members from India. Amidst these diplomatic tensions, India had temporarily suspended visa issuance to Canadian citizens, a service which was resumed several weeks later.\n\nThis incident underscores the complex dynamics between India and Canada, particularly concerning the contentious issue of Khalistan separatism. Both nations now face the challenge of navigating these diplomatic waters carefully to address their respective concerns while maintaining bilateral relations.", "source": {"uri": "oneindia.com",

They face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in connection to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, Canada, last year.\n\nThe RCMP on Saturday released photographs of the accused along with images of a Toyota Corolla allegedly used by the suspects leading up to Nijjar's murder.

He stated that some Canadians with \"pro-Pakistan leanings\" have organized themselves politically and become an influential political lobby. Jaishankar criticized the rise of pro-Khalistactivities in Canada and the arrest of three Indians over their alleged involvement in the killing of India-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.In a fresh critique of the Justine Trudeau-led dispensation for giving space and legitimacy to \"extremism, separatism, and advocates of violence\" in the name of free speech, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Canada has been issuing visas to people with links to organised crime despite warnings from New Delhi.\n\nSharing the stage with the state's intellectuals and professionals for an interaction on his book 'Why Bharat Matters', Jaishankar said some people in Canada, with 'pro-Pakistan leanings', have organised themselves politically and taken the shape of an influential political lobby.\n\nOn the rise of pro-Khalistactivities in Canada and the arrest of three Indians over their alleged involvement in the killing of India-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, Jaishankar said, \"In some countries, these kinds of people have organised themselves politically and become a political lobby and in some of these democratic countries, the politicians of these countries are made to believe that if they defer to these people or pander to these people, these people have some ability to get a community to support them. So, they have tried to create space for themselves in the politics of these countries. I mean, at this time, it's not so much a problem in the US.\"\n\n\"Our biggest problem right now is in Canada. Because in Canada, actually, today the party in power in Canada, and other parties in Canada have given these kinds of extremism, separatism, and advocates of violence a certain legitimacy in the name of free speech. See, when you tell them something, their answer is no no we are a democratic country but it is free speech. The point that they need to understand, it is no longer a world that runs as a one-way street. If there are that which happen out there, there will be pushback. Newton's law of politics will apply there also. There will be a reaction. Others will take steps or counter it,\" he added.\n\nHe said he saw reports that three people have been arrested, and, the Canadian police have conducted 'some investigation'.\n\nNijjar was shot and killed after he had stepped out of a gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A video clip of his killing reportedly surfaced in March this year, purportedly showing Nijjar being fatally shot by assailants, in what was claimed to be 'contract killing'.\n\nJaishankar said Canada has been welcoming people from India with links to organised crime, ignoring warnings by New Delhi.\n\n\"Often, when I see for example these kinds of attacks, threats to our embassies, because they concern me very deeply and I tell the foreign minister, suppose if (they) happened to you, if it was your embassy, your diplomat, your flag, how would you react. We have to keep our position strong on this particular report which has come. I also saw it yesterday night, I was coming to Odisha in the morning, somebody may have been arrested, their police may have done some investigation,\" Jaishankar said at the event.\n\n\"But, the fact is that a number of gangland people, a number of people with organised crime links from Punjab have been made welcome in Canada. We have been telling Canada saying look these are wanted criminals from India, you have given them visas. Many of them have come in false documentation and yet you allow them to live there. If you decide to import for political purposes people with very dubious, actually, very negative backgrounds, there will be issues, they have in some cases created problems in their own country as a result of their own policies. No, why would we fear, if something happens there, it is for them to worry about,\" he added.\n\nOn May 4, Canada's New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh levelled a fresh allegation of an India hand in the killing of Nijjar. However, the Canadian police administration did not share any evidence suggesting India's involvement in the killing of the Khaliatani leader.\n\nJagmeet's party backs the Liberal minority government led by Trudeau in exchange for support on some key bills.\n\nAfter the Canadian Police announced the arrest of three alleged accused in the killing of Hardep Nijjar, Jagmeet renewed his claim of an Indian hand in the incident.\n\n\"The Indian government hired assassins to murder a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil - at a place of worship. Today 3 arrests were made. Let me be clear - any Indian agent or state actor that ordered, planned or carried out this murder must be exposed and met with the full force of Canadian law. For Canada, democracy and free speech - there must be Justice for Hardeep Singh Nijjar,\" Jagmeet posted from his X handle.\n\nIn 2023, the Canadian PM alleged an Indian hand in the killing, a claim that was vehemently denied by India which called it 'absurd and motivated'. The Canadian Police have also not given any evidence linking India to the killing.\n\nEarlier, on Friday, Canadian police released photographs of all three persons arrested in the killing of India-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year amid an ongoing probe into alleged connections of the Indian government.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in a statement named the three men, all Indian nationals, as Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22 and released their photographs. The trio were arrested in Edmonton City in Alberta.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of Surrey, RCMP on Friday (local time) said that on the morning of May 3, IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta RCMP and the Edmonton Police Service, arrested the three men for the June 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey.\n\nThe trio have now been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the homicide, according to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police press release. Along with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police have also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of the evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of the murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nIndia and Canada are dealing with an unprecedented diplomatic crisis, after the Canadian Prime Minister accused agents of the Indian government of killing Canadian Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023. However, India has dismissed the accusations as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" (ANI)", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S.

Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday, the report said.\n\nNijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen, was shot dead on June 18, shortly after evening prayers at his Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey.\n\nIndia had on Thursday rejected fresh comments by Prime Minister Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar and said the remarks once again illustrated the political space given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nTrudeau addressed a Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday that was attended by some pro-Khalistan people.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, he told the media that the killing of Nijjar in British Columbia in June last year created a \"problem\" and that he cannot ignore it, in an apparent reference to his earlier allegations of involvement of Indian agents in the assassination.\n\n\"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in New Delhi at his weekly media briefing.\n\n\"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he said when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIn his comments to the media, Trudeau, referring to activities by pro-Khalistani elements, said that \"our job is not to crack down on political protest\".\n\nIndia on Monday summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of pro-'Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau and several other leaders. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\n\"It is a problem in our relations with India because we cannot ignore that,\" Trudeau said on the killing of Nijjar.\n\nDays after Trudeau's allegations, India asked Ottawa to downsize its diplomatic presence in the country to ensure parity. Subsequently, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nIndia has been asserting that its \"core issue\" with Canada remained that of the space given to separatists, terrorists and anti-India elements in that country.\n\nFollowing Trudeau's allegations last year, India temporarily suspended issuance of visas to Canadian citizens. The visa services were resumed several weeks later.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guru Nanak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaisakhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaisakhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India\u2013United_States_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India\u2013United States relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/05/03/600x338/The-ties-between-India-and-Canada-came-under-sever_1714756632691_1714756652776.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1153, "textEnd": 1160}], "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Find out how you can still connect with us.\n\nFive years before Canadian Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar was gunned down in the parking lot of his Surrey, B.C., temple, India sent the RCMP an urgent request.\n\nA bombing was about to occur in India, the notice said.\n\nTo stop the attack, the RCMP needed to arrest Nijjar immediately, the Indian authorities explained.\n\nActing on the information, the RCMP took Nijjar into custody, but it was quickly apparent India did not have reliable evidence to back its allegations.\n\nThe Mounties released Nijjar without any charges, a source familiar with the matter said, but the 2018 incident was a red flag for Canada.\n\nAlthough New Dehli had branded Nijjar a terrorist, alleging he was a B.C.-based leader of an armed separatist group responsible for attacks in India, proof was lacking.\n\nAs India repeatedly pressed Canada for his arrest over the years that followed, the RCMP grew increasingly concerned about the policing and human rights practices behind the allegations.\n\nTo address the problems, senior RCMP officials met with India's National Investigation Agency in November 2021 to discuss issues such as the evidentiary requirements of Canada's legal system.\n\nBut India allegedly opted for a different strategy.\n\nOn the evening of Sunday, June 18, 2023, Nijjar was leaving Surrey's Guru Nanak Sikh Temple, where he was president, when two gunmen opened fire on his pickup truck.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau claimed in September that investigators were \"pursuing credible allegations\" Indian government agents were involved, setting off a diplomatic spat that saw Ottawa and New Delhi expel each others' envoys.\n\nTrudeau has provided no details to back his accusations, India has denied involvement, and the Indian press has depicted the shooting as part of a local gang war.\n\nBut on Friday, the RCMP arrested the suspected hitmen accused of carrying out the killing.\n\nGlobal News has learned that Canadian investigators believe Nijjar's murder was an escalation of the Indian government's campaign against Sikh separatists, and that its foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, was likely behind the killing.\n\nFor almost a decade, India tried and failed to convince Canada to arrest Nijjar, alleging he was recruiting youths, funding weapons purchases, and masterminding attacks in India.\n\nThe Indian authorities filed extradition papers, issued Interpol warrants, offered a reward, and even claimed Nijjar was planning a \"major terrorist attack.\"\n\nExcept for the brief 2018 arrest, Canada never acted on the requests due to concerns about standards of the Indian police, with one official calling them \"incompetent.\"\n\nCanadian officials now suspect the killing was India's response: if Ottawa wouldn't stop separatist figures like Nijjar, Indian agents would do it themselves.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global

The killing had led to diplomatic strife between New Delhi and Ottawa.\n\nIn September last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told his country's parliament that intelligence agencies were actively pursuing \"credible allegations\" tying agents of the Indian government to the Sikh separatist's death. India had described this claim as \"absurd and motivated\".\n\nOn Friday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh and Karan Brar from Edmonton, Alberta, in connection with the case. They have been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy.\n\nThe three have been living in Canada for three to five years, police officials told media persons in a press conference, reported CBC News.\n\nAssistant Commissioner David Teboul of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the force is investigating connections between the accused and the Government of India.\n\nAn investigation is also ongoing to ascertain if there are others involved in Nijjar's killing, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superintendent Mandeep Mooker told media persons, according to Financial Times.\n\nTeboul described the Canadian investigating agencies' collaboration with Indian counterparts as \"rather challenging and difficult for the last several years\".\n\nNijjar was a supporter of Khalistan, an independent Sikh nation sought by some groups. He was the head of the Khalistan Tiger Force, which is designated a terrorist outfit in India.\n\nThe arrests came the same day Canada said in a report that it had found evidence of India's interference in its elections.\n\n\"Intelligence holdings indicate that the Government of India may have attempted to clandestinely provide financial support to preferred candidates during the 2021 election without the candidates' knowledge,\" said an interim report of the public inquiry into foreign interference in Canada.\n\nA final report will be released later this year.\n\nThe development comes after The Washington Post on Monday named a Research and Analysis Wing officer for alleged involvement in an alleged plot to assassinate Sikh separatist leaders in North America.\n\nThe report identified Vikram Yadav as the officer of India's foreign intelligence agency allegedly involved in the alleged plot to assassinate Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the United States and the killing of Nijjar.\n\nHowever, the Ministry of External Affairs on Tuesday described the report as \"unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations\".\n\nThe report cited assessments of American intelligence agencies that the operation against Pannun had been cleared by Samant Goel, the chief of India's foreign intelligence agency at the time.\n\nThe United States' spy agencies also \"more tentatively assessed\" that India's National Security Advisor Ajit Doval was likely to have known about the plans of the Research and Analysis Wing, according to The Washington Post. However, the newspaper quoted unidentified officials as saying that \"no smoking gun proof\" had emerged.\n\nPannun welcomed Friday's arrests in the killing of Nijjar.\n\n\"While today's action is a step forward, it only scratches the surface,\" Pannun said in a statement, reported Reuters. He also called for action to \"dismantle the networks that enable and perpetuate such crimes against Canadians on Canadian soil\".", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title":

They are accused of being the shooter, driver and lookout on the day Nijjar was killed.\n\nThey were arrested by police in Edmonton, in the neighboring province of Alberta, where they reside, and are being held behind bars pending further proceedings.\n\nAll had been in Canada for between three and five years, police said at a news conference on Friday.\n\nNijjar, who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015, advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India.\n\nHe was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, he was shot dead by masked assailants in the parking lot of the Sikh temple he lead in suburban Vancouver.\n\nTrudeau announced several months later that Canada had \"credible allegations\" linking Indian intelligence to the killing and expelled an Indian official, spurring the diplomatic tit-for-tat with New Delhi.\n\nIn November, the US Justice Department charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on American soil.\n\nProsecutors said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning.\n\nThe shock allegations came after US President Joe Biden hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a rare state visit, as Washington seeks closer ties with India against growing China's growing influence.\n\nUS intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India's top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, the Washington Post reported this week.\n\nCanada is home to some 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two percent of the country's population, with a vocal minority calling for creating an independent state of Khalistan.\n\nThe Sikh separatist movement is largely finished within India, where security forces used deadly force to put down an insurgency in the state of Punjab in the 1980s.\n\nbur-gen-st/mlm/des/tjj/acb", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India",

He was reacting to the arrest of three Indian nationals linked to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\n\n\"This is important because Canada is a rule-of-law country with a strong and independent justice system, as well as a fundamental commitment to protecting all its citizens,\" Trudeau said.\n\n\"As the RCMP (police) stated, the investigation remains ongoing, as does a separate and distinct investigation not limited to the involvement of the three people arrested yesterday,\" Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) quoted Trudeau as saying.\n\nOver here, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar dismissed concerns regarding the recent developments surrounding the Nijjar's alleged assassination, as \"Canada's internal politics\", PTI reported. India has designated Nijjar a terrorist for his Khalistani separatist support.\n\nResponding to Trudeau's criticism of India, Jaishankar told reporters that such criticisms stem from internal Canadian dynamics.\n\n\"India's image globally is now actually much much higher than it had been ever... Canada is an exception. You see the different country heads are praising Bharat and its Prime Minister,\" the external affairs minister said.\n\nThree Indian nationals residing in Edmonton, namely Karan Brar (22), Kamalpreet Singh (22), and Karanpreet Singh (28), face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder, PTI reported\n\nFollowing the arrest on May 3, Canadian law enforcement said they are collaborating with US counterparts, although specific details were not disclosed, it added. However, authorities hinted at the possibility of further arrests.\n\nAssistant Commissioner David Teboul of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), serving as the force's Pacific region commander, refrained from elaborating on purported ties between the detained trio and Indian authorities. Nonetheless, Teboul affirmed that the RCMP is \"investigating connections to the government of India.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jaishankar also expressed concerns over a faction within Canada supportive of Khalistan, leveraging the country's democratic processes to advance their agenda and become a \"vote bank\". He said some political political balance in Canada, rely on the backing of pro-Khalistan leaders due to their lack of parliamentary majority.\n\n\"The ruling party in Canada has no majority in Parliament and some parties depend on pro-Khalistan leaders. We have convinced them several times not to give visa, legitimacy or political space to such people which is causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship. But the Canadian government has not done anything ... India sought the extradition of 25 people, most of whom are pro-Khalistan, but they did not pay any heed,\" Jaishankar said.\n\nRelations between India and Canada soured following Trudeau's allegations implicating Indian agents in Nijjar's killing. India dismissed these claims as \"absurd\" and \"motivated\", criticising Canada for failing to provide evidence or collaborate on investigations.\n\nA Canadian citizen, Nijjar was shot and killed outside a gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18, 2023.\n\n\"Canada did not give any proof. They do not share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us. It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India. As election is coming in Canada, they indulge in vote bank politics,\" the external affairs minister said.\n\nUnlock a world of Benefits!

A Canadian citizen, Nijjar was a prominent local leader in the Khalistan movement pushing for the creation of an independent Sikh state in India.\n\nThree alleged hitmen in their 20s, all Indian nationals who arrived in Canada several years ago, have been accused of carrying out the killing.\n\nHere's what we know about the accused and the case.\n\nThe RCMP identified the men arrested Friday by their legal names, acknowledging they may also use shorter names or aliases:\n\nThe men are Indian nationals who had been living in Edmonton. Sources told CBC News investigators identified the three in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nThe men arrived in Canada on temporary visas, sources said, including some on student visas. None are believed to have pursued education while in Canada and none have obtained permanent residency.\n\nRCMP said the men all arrived in the country separately between three and five years ago, but would not comment further on the suspects' immigration statuses during a news conference on Friday.\n\nPolice expect that they will be transported to B.C. by Monday.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters the day Nijjar was killed, sources said.\n\nThe three men each face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Police believe the men plotted with others on plans to kill Nijjar, in Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023 and June 18, 2023, according to court documents.\n\nAsked by a reporter Friday whether the public should consider the men to have been \"guns for hire,\" police said more information would come out in court.\n\n\"The evidence will show the roles these individuals played,\" said Supt. Mandeep Mooker, the officer in charge of the RCMP's Integrated Homicide Investigation Team.\n\nPolice also said officers are \"aware\" others might have played a role in the killing. RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said the incident was still \"very much under active investigation.\"\n\nRCMP were also asked whether there are any Indian \"sleeper agents\" in Canada, a term that refers to an operative strategically placed in another country to work as needed after potentially being inactive, or \"asleep,\" for months or years.\n\nTeboul said it was a \"great question,\" but that he could not say more because the issue is \"very much at the centre of evidence and ongoing investigations.\"\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly said there is credible information pointing to the Indian government's involvement in the assassination plot, remarks that essentially accuse India of having a hand in plans to kill a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.\n\nTrudeau's accusation shattered the diplomatic relationship between the two countries when it was raised in the House of Commons last September.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has denied ordering extrajudicial killings in Canada. Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar initially decried the Canadian allegation as \"absurd\" and accused Canada of harbouring violent extremists.\n\nPolice are still investigating whether the three men arrested Friday are connected to the Indian government, according to Teboul, who said collaboration with \"partner agencies\" in India had been \"rather challenging and difficult.\"\n\nSources close to the investigation also told CBC News that police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada. Two men with links to organized crime in India were killed after Trudeau's comments about India in the House last year, as was a young boy:\n\nNo one has been charged in their deaths to date.\n\nRCMP said they would not comment Friday on the separate investigations in Winnipeg and Edmonton, but repeatedly noted officers in B.C. \"are co-ordinating with a variety of agencies\" in three to four provinces.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guru Nanak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_nationality_law", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian nationality law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pseudonym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_residency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Permanent residency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

In September 2023, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said that the Indian government had told Canada that it was not Government of India policy to engage in such acts like the killing of Nijjar\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar.... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of murder of Nijjar...

But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added.\n\nNijjar, who was designated a terrorist by the National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on the evening of June 18, 2023.\n\nThe video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March recently, showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a 'contract killing'.\n\nThe killing led to accusations from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the government of India had a hand in the killing -- a claim that was denied by India and led to the deterioration of diplomatic ties between Canada and India.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

Sikh activists say India orchestrated his killing because of Mr. Nijjar's leadership in promoting the creation of an independent Sikh state, called Khalistan, that would be carved from the South Asian country.\n\nLast September, Mr. Trudeau made a rare public allegation that agents of India may have been involved. The Indian government denied any involvement and dismissed Mr. Trudeau's claims as \"unsubstantiated,\" and the charge sparked a diplomatic crisis that has affected everything from trade to tourism with the most populous country in the world.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Trudeau did not mention the Indian government directly, but he acknowledged the Sikh community is feeling \"uneasy and perhaps even frightened right now.\"\n\nAttending an event to mark a Sikh cultural exhibit at the Royal Ontario Museum, the Prime Minister said \"the investigation remains ongoing, as does a separate and distinct investigation not limited to the involvement of the three people arrested.\"\n\nHe said \"every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free from discrimination and threats of violence in Canada.\"\n\nAt a news conference Friday announcing the arrests, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul affirmed the force's probe included \"investigating connections to the government of India.\" He said there are numerous cases still open and they are \"certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today.\"\n\nBut at a forum held in eastern India over the weekend, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar accused Canada of welcoming and harbouring criminals. Without referring to Mr. Nijjar's slaying directly, Mr. Jaishankar also accused Canada of giving electoral clout to people wanting to carve out Khalistan from India.\n\nSince Mr. Trudeau made public the allegations against India in the House of Commons last fall, more evidence has emerged of the involvement of Indian officials in the alleged plot. That includes a criminal indictment in the United States, which alleges an Indian intelligence officer enlisted underworld figures to assassinate Sikhs who advocate for Khalistan.\n\nThe three men charged Friday - Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22, and Karan Brar, 22 - have been living in Canada for the past three to five years.\n\nThe World Sikh Organization of Canada, and others, are calling for answers about who allegedly enlisted them and why.\n\n\"While we welcome arrests in the assassination of Bhai Hardeep Singh Nijjar, we believe these arrests raise disturbing questions about the nexus between the Government of India and criminal gangs,\" said Danish Singh, president of the World Sikh Organization, in a statement.\n\nIndia's government classified Mr. Nijjar as a terrorist in 2021, but his supporters see him as a human rights activist exercising his right to free speech.\n\nMr. Nijjar was a leading organizer with Sikhs for Justice, a group organizing votes for a non-binding referendum advocating for the creation of Khalistan. Hundreds of thousands of Sikhs have voted in the campaign in Canada, the United States, Britain and Australia.\n\nMr. Jaishankar, who was asked about the arrests on Saturday, said \"our biggest problem right now is in Canada.\"\n\nHe said the federal Liberals, as well as other parties, \"have given these kinds of extremism, separatism, advocates of violence a certain legitimacy, in the name of free speech.\"\n\nMr. Jaishankar said he has asked Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly about \"attacks or threats\" to India's diplomatic missions and staff in Canada.\n\nThere have been frequent protests in front of Indian consulates and the high commission in Ottawa. At one, in January, 2023, India complained that its diplomats felt threatened and suggested grenades had been thrown. Ottawa police said they were investigating \"the possible use of smoke canisters.\"\n\nIn his conversation with Ms. Joly, Mr. Jaishankar said he asked Ms. Joly to \"'suppose it happened to you. If it was your diplomat, your embassy, your flag, how would you react?' So, we have to keep our position strong.\"\n\nHe added: \"Somebody may have been arrested; the police may have done some investigation. But the fact is (a) number of gangland people, (a) number of people with organized crime links from Punjab, have been made welcome in Canada.\"\n\nSikh leaders allege India's spy agency, called the Research and Analysis Wing or RAW, has spent years focusing on Sikhs in Western countries advocating for the creation of Khalistan.\n\nThey point to comments made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a rally last month indicating the country's willingness to act against those abroad it considers threats.\n\n\"This new India comes into your home to kill you,\" Mr. Modi said, at an election rally on April 5. \"My India does not send dossiers. We kill terrorists at their home turf.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Indian High Commissioner in Ottawa said he was travelling and unable to comment on Mr. Modi's remarks. Indian High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma said he would not comment on \"arrests made for crimes committed in Canada,\" calling \"this an internal matter for Canada.\"\n\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun, a close friend of Mr. Nijjar's and another leader with Sikhs for Justice, urged Canadian officials to investigate Indian consular officials who he believes are involved in surveillance of Sikh activists abroad.\n\nThe New York-based lawyer was also targeted for assassination in June, 2023, according to a U.S. indictment that was unsealed in November.\n\n\"Canada's political leadership must stand on the right side of history in countering the Modi government's transnational repression of pro-Khalistan Sikhs on Canadian soil, to ensure this sort of violence never happens again,\" Mr. Pannun said in a statement.\n\n\"Canadian politicians of every stripe must stand with Canadian Sikhs' right to peacefully advocate for Khalistan without facing any violent retaliation from the Indian Government.\"\n\nLast week, Commissioner Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue released her initial report from the Public Inquiry into Foreign Interference that found that India is deeply involved in efforts to influence Canadian affairs, and that the country sees all pro-Khalistan political advocacy as a serious threat.\n\nIndia has attempted to disguise that interference by using Canadian and Canadian-based proxies that allow it to deny links to New Delhi, Ms. Hogue wrote, although she wasn't able to provide specifics because her findings were based on classified documents.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Sikh_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Sikh Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ontario_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Ontario Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.

The trio were arrested in Edmonton city in Alberta.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) of Surrey, RCMP on Friday (local time) said that on the morning of May 3, IHIT investigators, with the assistance of members from the British Columbia and Alberta RCMP and the Edmonton Police Service, arrested the three men for the June 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey a suburb in Vancouver.\n\nThe trio have now been charged with first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in relation to the homicide.\n\nAlong with photographs of the three accused, the Canadian police has also released the photographs of the car believed to have been used by the suspects in the time leading up to the homicide, in and around the Surrey area.\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference on Friday, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar.... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc refrained from confirming any connection to the Indian government, asserting that such inquiries should be directed to the RCMP, CTV News report.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc said.\n\n\"The police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added, according to CTV News report.\n\nPolice personnel have not given any evidence of any link to India as was being speculated in Canadian media. India has repeatedly denied the allegations, terming them \"absurd and motivated.\"\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Surrey RCMP received a report of a shooting at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey. First responding members located a man, later identified as Hardeep Singh Nijjar, suffering from fatal gunshot wounds inside a vehicle.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) has been carrying out the investigation. It has continued to work closely with a number of partner agencies and support services across Canada, as far east as Ontario, including the Surrey RCMP, the Alberta RCMP and other Lower Mainland Integrated Teams.\n\nThe Canadian police have not given any evidence of any link to India as was being speculated in Canadian media.\n\nNijjar's killing triggered diplomatic tensions between Canada and India after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of being involved in the killing -- a claim which India has rejected as \"absurd.\"\n\nThe video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March this year showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a \"contract killing\".

suggested Indian government involvement in the homicide.\n\nSpeaking Saturday at a gala in Toronto to celebrate Sikh heritage and culture, Trudeau acknowledged that many in Canada's Sikh community are \"feeling uneasy, and perhaps even frightened right now,\" but urged faith in the justice system.\n\n\"Let us remain calm and us remain steadfast in our commitment to our democratic principles and our system of justice,\" he said.\n\nTrudeau said the arrests were \"important because Canada is a rule of law country with a strong and independent justice system, as well as a fundamental commitment to protecting all its citizens.\"\n\nThree Indian nationals, two aged 22 and one aged 28, were arrested Friday on first-degree murder and conspiracy charges.\n\nThey are accused of being the shooter, driver and lookout on the day Nijjar was killed.\n\nPolice said they were still investigating the ties of the suspects, \"if any, to the Indian government,\" and whether others may have been involved.\n\nNijjar -- who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 -- advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India.\n\nHe was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, he was shot dead by masked assailants in the parking lot of the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver.\n\nTrudeau announced several months later that Canada had \"credible allegations\" linking Indian intelligence to the killing and expelled an Indian official, touching off a diplomatic tit-for-tat with New Delhi.\n\nIndia dismissed the allegations as \"absurd\" and responded furiously, briefly curbing visas for Canadians and forcing Ottawa to withdraw diplomats.\n\nIn November, the

But he said police could not comment on nature of the evidence or the motive. \"This matter is very much under active investigation,\" Teboul said.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sparked a diplomatic feud with India in September when he said that there were \"credible allegations\" of Indian involvement in the slaying of Nijjar. India had accused Nijjar of links to terrorism but angrily denied involvement in the slaying.\n\nNijjar, an Indian-born citizen of Canada, was a plumber and also a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland, known as Khalistan.

India has categorically dismissed these allegations as baseless and politically motivated.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), this investigation is also exploring connections to three other homicides in Canada, including the tragic death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.

Trudeau's remarks have been met with criticism from India, with External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal condemning the political space afforded to separatist and extremist ideologies in Canada.\n\nIndia's response to Trudeau's comments included summoning the Canadian deputy high commissioner to express strong disapproval of pro-Khalistan slogans raised at the event attended by Trudeau. This incident has not only impacted diplomatic relations but also led to India temporarily suspending visa services for Canadian citizens, a decision that was later reversed.\n\nNijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen and a prominent Khalistani separatist wanted in India on terror charges, was shot dead on June 18, shortly after evening prayers. His assassination has become a focal point of contention between India and Canada, with both nations grappling with the diplomatic fallout. Following Trudeau's allegations last year, India demanded Canada reduce its diplomatic staff in the country, leading to Canada withdrawing 41 diplomats and their family members from India.\n\nThis series of events underscores the complex dynamics between India and Canada, particularly concerning the issue of separatism and extremism.

The arrest of these suspects comes amidst allegations by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau regarding the involvement of Indian agents in Nijjar's murder, claims that India has fervently denied.\n\nThe tension between the two nations escalated following Trudeau's public statements in September last year, suggesting a potential link between Indian government operatives and the killing of Nijjar.

This case has not only sparked diplomatic tensions but has also highlighted concerns over political space being afforded to separatist movements within Canada. External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal emphasized how such incidents not only affect India-Canada relations but also foster a climate conducive to violence and criminality within Canada itself.\n\nPrime Minister Trudeau's recent comments at a Khalsa Day event in Toronto, which was attended by pro-Khalistan supporters, reiterated his concerns over Nijjar's killing and its implications for Canada-India relations. India's strong reaction included summoning the Canadian deputy high commissioner to express its protest over pro-Khalistan slogans raised at the event attended by Trudeau.\n\nIn retaliation to Trudeau's allegations last year, India had requested Canada to reduce its diplomatic presence in India, leading to Canada withdrawing 41 diplomats and their family members. The incident had also led to a temporary suspension of visa services for Canadian citizens by India, which were resumed after several weeks.\n\nThis ongoing saga underscores the complex dynamics between Canada and India, with both nations grappling with issues related to separatism, extremism, and diplomatic relations.

Certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today.\"\n\nThe Indian government is yet to officially respond to the arrests.\n\nThe suspects -- Karan Brar (22), Kamalpreet Singh (22) and Karanpreet Singh (28) -- had entered Canada on student visas, sources told Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).\n\nEach suspect has been charged with one count of murder using a firearm and one count of conspiracy to commit murder, according to court documents seen by CTV News. The suspects were taken into custody by the police Friday.\n\nThe indictments reportedly claim the conspiracy unfolded between 1 May, 2023, and 18 June, 2023 -- the day of Nijjar's killing -- across the Canadian cities of Surrey and Edmonton.\n\nWhile speaking to the media, the police said they are unable to comment on the nature of the evidence in the case, nor the motive behind the murder.\n\nNijjar was shot and killed outside Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia. A Canadian citizen, he was the chief of the banned Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) and considered one of India's most-wanted terrorists. He has also campaigned for the creation of Khalistan, a separate state from India.\n\nNijjar's death sparked a diplomatic rift between India and Canada. Last September, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged Indian agents played a role in Nijjar's case. India has repeatedly denied the claims and subsequently cancelled diplomatic immunity for 41 Canadian diplomats for \"mutual diplomatic parity\".\n\nSeparately, US officials are investigating the potential role of Indian government employees in a foiled assassination plot against Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.\n\nEarlier this week, the White House responded to a question about a Washington Post report that named Indian officials involved in the alleged murder plot against Pannun, including former RAW chief Samant Goel.\n\n\"This is a serious matter, and we're taking that very, very seriously. The government of India has been very clear with us that they are taking this seriously and will investigate. And we expect that accountability from the government based on that,\" White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday.\n\nThe Modi government, meanwhile, set up a high-level enquiry committee last year to look into concerns shared by Washington. This committee is investigating the networks of organised criminals, terrorists and others.\n\nAlso Read: 'Plumber' to 'terrorist' -- who was Hardeep Nijjar, Khalistan Tiger Force chief shot dead in Canada\n\nSpeaking at the press conference Friday, Superintendent Mandeep Mooker (officer in charge of IHIT) said the three suspects arrested in the Nijjar case had been living as non-permanent residents in Canada for the last three to five years.\n\nAccording to local Canadian reports, the three men were members of an alleged hit squad. A report by CBC cites sources as claiming the men had links to notorious Punjabi gangster Lawrence Bishnoi. The don is in jail in Gujarat for allegedly murdering Punjabi rapper-politician Sidhu Moose Wala in 2022.\n\nFootage later emerged of Nijjar's killing that purportedly showed two masked men committing the crime and fleeing in a silver car.\n\nOn Friday, before the Canadian police's announcement, Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc reacted to reports of the three arrests, saying: \"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does.\"\n\n\"The police operation...confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" Leblanc added.\n\nAnalysts have debated whether Canada can pursue a case against India at the International Court of Justice. However, both countries would have to consent to compulsory jurisdiction of the court.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A portrait of Nijjar is seen as protesters gather outside the Consulate of India in response to his shooting death, in Vancouver, B.C., Saturday, June 24, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ethan CairnsSURREY, B.C. - Homicide police in British Columbia say they will be providing a \"significant update\" on the killing of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, amid reports that arrests have been made in the case. Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc says he has been informed about the update by the RCMP in the case that triggered allegations by Ottawa of Indian government involvement in the killing last year. He says the case \"likely and very clearly will end up before criminal courts.\" The CBC has reported that alleged members of a hit squad were arrested and that investigators are looking into possible links with three other killings. Nijjar, who had campaigned for a separate Sikh homeland in India, was gunned down in his vehicle outside his gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., last June. He was the temple president at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, B.C. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in the House of Commons in September that there was credible intelligence linking the killing to the Indian government, touching off a diplomatic row that resulted in India suspending the issuing of visas to Canadians for two months. India has repeatedly denied involvement in Nijjar's death. Members of the Sikh community in Canada have accused the Indian government of being behind the murder and attempting to silence voices advocating for Sikh separation, but police have previously denied having any evidence of that. Homicide investigators have said they were looking for at least three suspects in Nijjar's killing. Two suspects ran from the scene of the shooting on foot, while a third was in a getaway car a few blocks away from the temple.

The police are expected to share details later Friday (local time). Nijjar was killed outside the Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18.\n\nThe CBC report further claimed that the \"arrested men could be part of an alleged hit squad tasked by the government of India.\" This charge has been repeatedly denied by India. In September 2023, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said that the Indian government had told Canada that it was not Government of India policy to engage in such acts like the killing of Hardeep Nijjar\n\nIn its report on Friday, CBC news further quoted sources, saying that the arrested men arrived in Canada on temporary visas after 2021. They are said to be alleged associates of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who is currently under arrest in India. Bishnoi is accused of plotting the killing of popular singer Sidhu Moose Wala in May 2022.\n\nAccording to another Canadian news outlet, CTV news, court documents show the three arrested as Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh and Karan Brar. They face one count of first degree murder and a count of conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nThe arrests come in the backdrop of frayed relationship between India and Canada. Last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had alleged that there was an Indian government hand behind the killing of Nijjar, a charge that the Indian government had vehemently denied, calling it absurd.\n\nEarlier this month, purported video footage of the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar surfaced, showing Nijjar being shot by armed men. Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by the National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia. The attack was described as 'highly coordinated' and involved six men and two vehicles.\n\nThe India-Canada relationship continues to be troubled. On May 2, the Ministry of External Affairs condemned pro-Khalistan slogans at a public event attended by Justin Trudeau, and stressed that this shows the kind of political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\n\nDuring the weekly briefing, the MEA spokesperson said, \"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well...His remarks illustrate once again the kind of political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence. This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens.\"\n\nDuring the Khalsa Day Celebrations that took place in Toronto, loud chants of pro-Khalistan slogans were seen being raised in the presence of Canadian PM Trudeau, as well as opposition leader Pierre Poilievre.

They face charges of murder and conspiracy according to B.C. court records, with the alleged offenses taking place in Surrey and Edmonton, where the men resided and were apprehended.

India denied involvement, leading to strained diplomatic relations between Ottawa and New Delhi.\n\nCanadian officials are investigating whether Nijjar's murder was part of an Indian intelligence operation targeting the Khalistan separatist movement, which has gained traction within Sikh communities globally.\n\nNijjar, a plumber and temple president, had been accused by India of leading the Khalistan Tiger Force terrorist group but had not faced charges in Canada.\n\nThe killing occurred against a backdrop of rising transnational repression, where foreign states employ intimidation, coercion, and violence to advance their interests abroad.

These individuals are believed to be part of an alleged hit squad, reportedly directed by the Indian government, to assassinate Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey last year. This incident has escalated tensions following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations against India's involvement in Nijjar's killing, which India has categorically dismissed as baseless and politically motivated.\n\nThe arrests were made nearly a year after Nijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen, was fatally shot outside his gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., on June 18, 2023. The accused, identified as Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh, and Karan Brar, have been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder, according to court documents. Reports suggest that these individuals entered Canada on student visas but are suspected of operating under the directives of Indian intelligence agencies.\n\nCanada's Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc refrained from confirming any direct links to the Indian government but expressed full confidence in the capabilities of Canada's security forces and the ongoing RCMP operations. The indictments reveal that the alleged conspiracy spanned across Surrey and Edmonton from May 1, 2023, until Nijjar's death. Furthermore, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that police are investigating potential connections to three additional murders in Canada.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have been closely monitoring the suspects for months, leading to their arrest during operations conducted in at least two provinces. This police action underscores the seriousness with which Canadian authorities are treating this case.\n\nRelations between India and Canada have been tense since Trudeau's public comments on Nijjar's assassination last year. India has criticized Canada for providing a platform for separatism and extremism, which it believes not only affects bilateral relations but also fosters a climate of violence within Canada itself. In response to Trudeau's remarks at a Khalsa Day event attended by pro-Khalistan supporters, India summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner to express its strong protest.\n\nThe aftermath of Trudeau's allegations saw India requesting Canada to reduce its diplomatic presence in the country, leading to the withdrawal of 41 Canadian diplomats and their families from India. Additionally, India temporarily suspended visa services for Canadian citizens, a decision that was later reversed after several weeks.\n\nThis incident highlights the complex dynamics of international relations and the challenges faced by nations in addressing issues of terrorism and political extremism within their borders and abroad. As investigations continue, both countries remain at a critical juncture, navigating through diplomatic tensions while addressing concerns over security and political ideologies.", "source": {"uri":

The Canadian Sikh leader was gunned down almost a year ago in British Columbia. Moninder Singh lost his friend of 15 years last June outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population.\n\nThe 45-year-old's death rocked Canada's Sikh community. A few months later, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau triggered a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi when he cited evidence of Indian government involvement in Nijjar's death. On Friday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police laid murder charges against three Indian men in connection with Nijjar's death and said they were probing possible ties to the Indian government.\n\nThe Indian mission in Ottawa did not respond to requests for comment. The arrests are \"bittersweet,\" Moninder Singh told Reuters Friday afternoon.\n\n\"It's a relief that the investigation is moving forward. At the same time, it's still raising a lot of questions,\" said Singh, a spokesperson for the B.C. Gurdwaras Council. Nijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labeled Nijjar a \"terrorist\" in 2020.\n\nAs Canada scrutinizes foreign interference in its elections, Singh called for a separate inquiry focusing solely on Indian interference in Canadian affairs. He and other Sikh Canadian leaders told Reuters Canada has taken Indian interference more seriously since Nijjar's death.\n\n\"I think that Canada has been soft on Indian interference for the past four decades. The Canadian Sikh community has had to bear the brunt of it,\" said Balpreet Singh, legal counsel for the World Sikh Organization. But Nijjar's death represents \"the undermining of (Canada's) sovereignty at a very, very different level,\" Moninder Singh said.\n\nNijjar is missed on a community, a family and a personal level, his friend said. \"He was such a strong leader, and a strong voice ... I've mistakenly called him since he passed away and sent him messages and it takes me a second to realize what I've done.\"\n\nBut Nijjar would not want his community to live in fear, Singh said. \"His death has brought about such huge momentum to galvanize the community,\" he said.\n\n\"I think his expectation is, don't let them strike fear into you.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sikhism in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Sikh_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Sikh Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_05_37_3344557.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ethan CairnsSURREY, B.C. - Three men have been arrested and charged with the murder of B.C. Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Integrated Homicide Investigation Team Supt. Mandeep Mooker says Karan Brar, Karanpreet Singh and Kamalpreet Singh, all men in their 20s, were arrested today in Edmonton. Mooker says all three are Indian nationals and have been living as non-permanent residents in Canada for the last three to five years. The men are expected to be transported to B.C. by Monday to face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul says in addition to the murder case, there are separate investigations looking into possible connections to the Government of India. Nijjar was shot and killed last June as he left the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, B.C.

He was head of Khalistan Referendum campaign in Canada and President of a Gurdwara in Surrey, BC. He was an upright individual, a peaceful man with demonstrated commitment to community service.\"\n\nPannun, who was himself a target of the high profile Indian killing hit last year but survived after the plot was foiled by the US spies, blamed Indian Prime Minister Modi for the killing of Nijjar and for ordering a hit on him.\n\n\"In the light of Prime Minister Modi's own statements, he is a murderer who recently proclaimed in a speech that 'This New India comes into your home to kill you. My India does not send dossiers. We kill terrorists at their home turf',\" he added.\n\nThe SFJ founder said: \"While today's action by Canadian authorities, which led to the arrest of those directly involved in the killing, is a step forward, it only scratches the surface. High-ranking Indian diplomats such as Indian High Commissioner to Canada Sanjay Verma and Consul General of India in Vancouver Manish provided logistical support and intelligence for the assassination. They must be charged. Reports, including one from the Washington Post, suggest that the RAW agents who assisted in carrying out the assassination are still actively positioned at the Indian Consulate in Vancouver.\"\n\nPannun said that simply removing RAW agents from Indian missions does not suffice to counteract the Modi government's spree of transnational terrorism.\n\nThe Sikh leader, who lives under security around the clock, said: \"If we are to genuinely combat this wave of transnational violence, those Indian diplomats who oversee RAW's espionage operations in Canada must be held accountable and face legal proceedings. Only through such decisive actions can we hope to dismantle the networks that enable and perpetuate such crimes against Canadians on Canadian soil.\n\n\"Canadian politicians of every stripe must stand with the Canadian Sikhs' right to peacefully advocate for Khalistan without facing any violent retaliation from the Indian Government. Canada's political leadership must stand on the right side of history in countering the Modi government's transnational repression of pro-Khalistan Sikhs on Canadian soil, to ensure this sort of violence never happens again.\"\n\n\"Nijjar laid his life working for the cause of Khalistan, Phase III of Khalistan Referendum voting on July 28, 2024 in Calgary, AB is dedicated to Shaheed Hardeep Singh Nijjar and other Canadians who sacrificed their lives for the cause of Khalistan,\" the SFJ founder said.\n\nThe three India men arrested on Friday were living in the city of Edmonton, Alberta, and will be transported on Monday to British Columbia to face charges. The indictments allege the conspiracy was planned in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1 and June 18.\n\nBrian Edwards, RCMP assistant commissioner, called the killing \"outrageous\" and \"reprehensible\", adding the investigators worked closely with members of the Sikh community.\n\n\"It had a profound impact on the residents of Surrey and, notwithstanding today the announcing of charges, those scars will remain in our community for a long time,\" he said.\n\nIn September, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, told parliament his government had \"credible allegations\" that India was behind the killing, calling the death of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil an \"unacceptable violation of our sovereignty\".\n\nThe fallout from Nijjar's murder has chilled relations between Canada and India and exposed what officials say is a transnational campaign of violence by India, meant to target dissidents abroad.\n\nCanada's public safety minister said the arrests confirmed \"that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously\".\n\nThe men arrested on Friday are Indian citizens who entered Canada on student visas three to five years ago. None have permanent residency, said Supt Mandeep Mooker. More arrests in connection to the murder are possible, he said, adding that police were working with other units in \"active investigations\" across the country.\n\nSix men and two vehicles were involved in Nijjar's murder, according to previous statements from police.\n\n\"We remain dedicated to finding and arresting each one of these individuals,\" said Mooker.", "source": {"uri": "geo.tv",

It is also looking into possible connections to the Government of India.\n\nNotably, the ties between India and Canada came under severe strain after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last year alleged the \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in the murder of Najjar. India had denied the charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" Addressing a press conference on Friday, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said as per news agency PTI, that the case is \"very much under active investigation.\"\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India\", he was quoted as saying further.\n\nSuperintendent Mandeep Mooker, who was also part of the press conference added that all three suspects were not known to police before their arrest last night. The three have been identified as Karan Brar, Karanpreet Singh, and Kamalpreet Singh. All three are believed to be in their 20s. They have been reportedly living in Canada for the last three to five years as non-permanent residents, he added.\n\nA report by Global News said that the three entered the country on \"student visas but may have been working at the direction of Indian intelligence when they shot Nijjar.\" As per Canadian authorities, all three accused are facing allegations of first-degree murder, as well as conspiracy to kill Najjar.\n\nThe police are also looking to investigate the possible links to three additional murders that took place in Canada in recent times, which include the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton. According to a report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), members of the hit squad are believed to have played different roles in the killing of Najjar, which include that of shooters, drivers, and spotters.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "subhajit_sankar_dasgupta@news9live.com", "name": "Subhajit Sankar Dasgupta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_(police)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superintendent (police)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karan Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nijjar1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 209, "textEnd": 216}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The Canadian Sikh leader was gunned down almost a year ago in British Columbia.\n\nMoninder Singh lost his friend of 15 years last June outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population.\n\nThe 45-year-old's death rocked Canada's Sikh community. A few months later, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau triggered a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi when he cited evidence of Indian government involvement in Nijjar's death.\n\nOn Friday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police laid murder charges against three Indian men in connection with Nijjar's death and said they were probing possible ties to the Indian government.\n\nThe Indian mission in Ottawa did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe arrests are \"bittersweet,\" Moninder Singh told Reuters Friday afternoon.\n\n\"It's a relief that the investigation is moving forward. At the same time, it's still raising a lot of questions,\" said Singh, a spokesperson for the B.C. Gurdwaras Council.\n\nNijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labeled Nijjar a \"terrorist\" in 2020.\n\nAs Canada scrutinizes foreign interference in its elections, Singh called for a separate inquiry focusing solely on Indian interference in Canadian affairs.\n\nHe and other Sikh Canadian leaders told Reuters Canada has taken Indian interference more seriously since Nijjar's death.\n\n\"I think that Canada has been soft on Indian interference for the past four decades. The Canadian Sikh community has had to bear the brunt of it,\" said Balpreet Singh, legal counsel for the World Sikh Organization.\n\nBut Nijjar's death represents \"the undermining of (Canada's) sovereignty at a very, very different level,\" Moninder Singh said.\n\nNijjar is missed on a community, a family and a personal level, his friend said.\n\n\"He was such a strong leader, and a strong voice ... I've mistakenly called him since he passed away and sent him messages and it takes me a second to realize what I've done.\"\n\nBut Nijjar would not want his community to live in fear, Singh said.\n\n\"His death has brought about such huge momentum to galvanize the community,\" he said.\n\n\"I think his expectation is, don't let them strike fear into you.\"\n\n(Reporting by Anna Mehler Paperny;

He was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India.\n\nSept. 1, 2023: A Canadian trade official says Canada paused talks on a proposed trade treaty with India, an unexpected move that came about three months after both countries said they planned to seal an initial pact this year.\n\nSept. 10, 2023: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveys strong concerns about Sikh separatist protests in Canada to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the sidelines of a G20 summit in New Delhi.\n\nSept. 18, 2023: Trudeau tells parliament that Canada was \"actively pursuing credible allegations\" linking Indian government agents to the killing of Nijjar.\n\nSept. 19, 2023: India dismisses Trudeau's assertion as \"absurd\".

In September 2023, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said that the Indian government had told Canada that it was not Government of India policy to engage in such acts like the killing of Nijjar\n\nAddressing reporters at a news conference, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, who leads the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, emphasised the active nature of the investigation into Nijjar's murder.\n\n\"Three suspects have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar.... We are not able to make any comments on the nature of evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of murder of Nijjar... However, I will say this matter is very much under active investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"There are separate and distinct investigations ongoing into these matters, certainly not limited to the involvement of the people arrested today, and these efforts include investigating connections to the government of India,\" Teboul also said.\n\nThe indictments allege that the conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023, and the day of Nijjar's killing.\n\nScheduled updates on the case from the BC RCMP and the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team were announced for 12:30 pm PT on Friday.\n\nNijjar's assassination triggered diplomatic tensions between Canada and India after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau disclosed intelligence investigations regarding a potential link between the Indian government and the killing.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc refrained from confirming any connection to the Indian government, asserting that such inquiries should be directed to the RCMP, as reported by CTV News.\n\n\"I have full confidence in the security apparatus of the government of Canada and the work of the RCMP, and the work that the (Canadian) Security Intelligence Service does,\" Leblanc affirmed.\n\n\"The police operation that you see ongoing today confirms that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously. But questions with respect to particular links or non-links are properly put to the RCMP,\" he added.\n\nNijjar, who was designated a terrorist by the National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on the evening of June 18, 2023.\n\nThe video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March recently, showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a 'contract killing'.\n\nThe killing led to accusations from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the government of India had a hand in the killing -- a claim that was denied by India and led to the deterioration of diplomatic ties between Canada and India.

They are accused of being shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed.\n\nCBC said police were also investigating possible links to three more murders, including of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton. Police are reportedly set to hold a press conference later Friday.\n\nNijjar, who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015, advocated for a separate Sikh state carved out of India.\n\nHe was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nLast June, he was shot dead by masked assailants in the parking lot of a Sikh temple near the west coast city of Vancouver.\n\nTrudeau announced several months later that Canada had \"credible allegations\" linking Indian intelligence to the killing and expelled an Indian official, spurring the diplomatic tit-for-tat with New Delhi.\n\nIn November, the US Justice Department charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on American soil.\n\nProsecutors said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning.\n\nThe shock allegations came after US President Joe Biden hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a rare state visit, as Washington seeks closer ties with India against growing China's growing influence.\n\nUS intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India's top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, the Washington Post reported this week.\n\nCanada is home to some 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two percent of the country's population, with a vocal minority calling for creating a separate state of Khalistan.\n\nThe Sikh separatist movement is largely finished within India, where security forces used deadly force to put down an insurgency in the state of Punjab in the 1980s.\n\nbur-gen-st/mlm/des/acb\n\nMore from this section\n\nCal South Strengthens Partnership with Stack Sports, Adding CaptainU

Nijjar succumbed to his injuries at the scene.\n\nAssistant commissioner David Teboul, commander of the federal policing program in the Pacific region, said police would not be able to speak about the \"nature of the evidence\" collected by police, nor the motive behind the killing.\n\n\"I will say this matter is still very much under active investigation,\" he said. \"I will underscore that today's announcements are not a complete account of the investigative work currently underway.\"\n\nDays after the shooting, Sgt. Timothy Pierotti of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) shared details of two suspects. According to investigators, the suspects -- who were wearing face coverings -- ran southbound on 122 Street, through Cougar Creek Park and onto 121 Street after the incident. A getaway vehicle was possibly waiting for them upon their arrival.\n\nREAD MORE: Two heavy-set suspects ran through park after Surrey temple president's shooting, IHIT says\n\nAccording to the Nijjar family, the temple president had been meeting with Canadian Security Intelligence Service officers regularly before his death, as threats against him were mounting. Balraj Nijjar said his father was told about the threats and was advised to stay home.\n\nNijjar was also a vocal advocate for the Khalistan movement, which advocates for a separate Sikh homeland in Punjab, India, which led to accusations against him of terrorism and separatism by the government.\n\nREAD MORE: CSIS warned B.C. Sikh temple leader of assassination threat before killing: lawyer\n\nREAD MORE: Nijjar, CSIS met regularly before he was killed in Surrey, son says\n\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun, a close associate of Nijjar's, said that Nijjar had asked authorities for a bulletproof vest weeks before he was killed but was told they could not provide one. The president was also told to avoid going to the gurdwara at his usual times and should avoid being seen in public, Pannun said.\n\nBut Balraj said his father did not want to hide.\n\nWhile the Indian government has denied involvement in Nijjar's death, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in September 2023 that there was \"credible\" information linking India to the killing.\n\nSurrey Mayor Brenda Locke, in a statement issued May 3, urges the federal government to \"take every opportunity to determine if there was foreign government involvement in the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.\"\n\n\"That question needs to be answered given the circumstances surrounding Mr. Nijjar's murder,\" she said.\n\nThis story is currently developing.

The arrest also indicates the absence of involvement of India behind the killing of Khalistani separatist. It is to be noted that Nijjar was shot down by unknown assailants outside a gurdwara in Surrey in Canada's British Columbia province last year.\n\nFollowing the death of Nijjar, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had blamed India to be involved in the killing, turning the diplomatic relations between the two nations sour as India called the allegations baseless.\n\nEven after months of bogus 'India link', Trudeau has failed to furnish any concrete evidence against India.\n\nMeanwhile, Canadian politician Jagmeet Singh has accused India of hiring these assassins to kill Nijjar. Demanding justice for Nijjar, Jagmeet Singh, the Leader of Canada's New Democratic Party said that any Indian agent involved in the murder must be exposed and met with the full force of Canadian law.\n\nIn a post on X, Singh wrote, \"The Indian government hired assassins to murder a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil - at a place of worship. Today 3 arrests were made. Let me be clear - any Indian agent or state actor that ordered, planned or carried out this murder must be exposed and met with the full force of Canadian law. For Canada, democracy and free speech - there must be Justice for Hardeep Singh Nijjar(sic).\"\n\nJagmeet Singh's NDP has supported the Liberal minority government led by Justin Trudeau in exchange for support on some key bills.\n\n'Desperate Attempt by Trudeau to Engage India'\n\nWhile speaking exclusively to Republic Media, activist Hardeep Singh Sikka said,\" There is a desperate attempt by Trudeau to engage India in the matter and show India in a negative light and there is a reason for it as he has no choice. He is living on Khalistani funds. There is a free flow of drugs and money from India gurdwara in hawala to Canadian gurdwaras in hawala, where both the money becomes white.\"\n\n\"Check the biodata of the arrested accused and find out whether they took the asylum on Khalistani ground and who is trying to pump money into them. What is the reason that Canada is desperate to name India without giving any proof, without allowing us to participate in that. Khalistani can never be Sikhs and Sikhs can never be Khalistani,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Canadian police have released the images of the arrested accused.\n\nCanada's Conservative Party Issues Statement\n\nInterestingly, the Conservative Party, Opposition Party in Canada, has issued a statement on the arrest of suspects, saying any foreign interference, particularly the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil, is unacceptable.\n\nThe statement read, \" The murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar is an extremely serious crime. Any foreign interference, particularly the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil, is unacceptable. We are glad that there have finally been arrests that will bring some justice for Mr. Nijjar's family and community.\"\n\n\"We wish the government was able to foil this plot and stop this murder from happening in the first place, as was the case in the United States. This only further demonstrates that the government must take further action to protect our country, including by immediately implementing a foreign influence registry. Conservatives will continue to fight any foreign interference, from any country, and put an end to any attempts by foreign governments to target our country and our people,\" the statement further read.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "digital_desk@republicworld.com", "name": "Digital Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagmeet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jagmeet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawala", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Murder_Mystery", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Murder Mystery", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/whatsappimage2024-03-28at9.56.59am-171160191009516_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5372549019607843, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

and became a citizen in 2015, advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India.\n\nHe was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, he was shot dead by masked assailants in the parking lot of the Sikh temple he lead in suburban Vancouver.\n\nMore from this section Champions celebrated in Westchester's

Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar | CBC News", "body": "Months-long investigation into politically charged killing also probes links to other cases: sources\n\nCanadian police have arrested members of an alleged hit squad investigators believe was tasked by the government of India with killing prominent Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, B.C. last June, CBC News has learned.\n\nSources close to the investigation also told CBC News that police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, according to the sources.\n\nThe men were arrested Friday during police operations in at least two provinces. Sources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance.\n\nPolice are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday.\n\nCBC News learned of the arrests -- as well as other information that may not be announced by police on Friday -- through extensive discussions with senior investigative and government sources, as well as members of the Sikh community.\n\nThe investigative and government sources spoke with CBC News on the condition that they not be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The sources in the Sikh community expressed concerns about their personal security, so CBC News is not disclosing their identities.\n\nNijjar, a 45-year-old Canadian citizen, was shot dead on June 18, shortly after evening prayers at his Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., in what appeared to be a highly coordinated attack, according to video of the incident obtained by CBC's The Fifth Estate.\n\nLast August, Canadian officials told representatives of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in person that Canada had intelligence linking it to Nijjar's killing.\n\nA month later -- on Sept. 18, 2023, not long after returning from a fraught visit to India for the G20 Summit -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rose in the House of Commons to state that \"Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India\" and Nijjar's killing.\n\n\"Any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty,\" he added.\n\nModi's government has denied it ordered extrajudicial killings in the U.S. and Canada. Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar initially decried the Canadian allegation as \"absurd\" and accused Canada of harbouring violent extremists.\n\nThe minister's tone at a Sept. 27, 2023 speaking event was somewhat less confrontational. Jaishankar said at that time that \"we told the Canadians that this is not the government of India's policy.\"\n\nIn December, after a U.S. indictment accused an unnamed Indian government employee of playing a role in a murder-for-hire plot in the U.S., Jaishankar issued another statement.\n\n\"We have always maintained that if any country, not just Canada, has a concern and gives us some input or some basis for that concern, we are always open to look at it,\" he said.\n\nBloomberg reported in March that the Indian government had given the U.S. a report in which it acknowledged that Indian agents were involved in the U.S. murder plot, but claimed they were rogue operatives.\n\nAt this stage of Canada's investigation, investigators are unlikely to expand on any possible connections between Nijjar's alleged killers and Indian government officials.\n\nHowever, during a roundtable with Canadian Punjabi media on Sunday, Trudeau said the work by intelligence and police agencies was ongoing.\n\n\"It is very good and rigorous work. And when the time comes for them to conclude that investigation, there will be some very, very clear things that everyone around the world, including in India, will see as to responsibilities and involvement,\" he said.\n\nJust two days after Trudeau's bombshell statement in the House -- on Sept. 20, 2023 -- Sukhdool Singh Gill, 39, of Winnipeg was found shot to death in a duplex in the city's northwest. A neighbour told police he heard 11 shots.\n\nGill also went by the alias Sukha Duneke and allegedly was part of the Davinder Bambiha gang in India, according to police documents in that country. Indian media have reported that he fled to Canada in 2017 using a false passport.\n\nGill was one of Punjab's most wanted men, accused of extortion and arranging money for gang members to buy weapons. Police in India have publicly linked him to murders and other serious crimes.\n\nHe was also on the radar of the government of India.\n\nOne day before his killing, Gill's name and photo appeared on a list of 43 names of suspected terrorists drawn up by India's National Investigation Agency (NIA), which linked him to the separatist Khalistan Tiger Force. India previously accused Nijjar of being part of the same organization.\n\nThe day after Gill died, the NIA tweeted an image of him along with other wanted men.\n\nSix weeks after Gill's death, another alleged Sikh gangland figure in another western province was shot dead in a brazen daylight attack that also claimed the life of his 11-year-old son.\n\nHarpreet Uppal, a 41-year-old with links to organized crime, was shot dead in his vehicle in a busy suburban shopping area of Edmonton on Nov. 9, 2023. Two boys were in the vehicle, Uppal's 11-year-old son, Gavin, and a friend.\n\nThe Edmonton Police Service later said the killers shot both father and son, while sparing the other boy. EPS Acting Superintendent Colin Derkson said Gavin \"was not caught in a crossfire or killed by mistake.\"\n\nNo one has been charged in the Gill or Uppal killings, and the sources told CBC News charges in connection to these cases are not expected to come Friday.\n\nThe sources told CBC News the men arrested Friday in relation to Nijjar's killing are Indian citizens who arrived in Canada on temporary visas after 2021, some of them student visas. None are believed to have pursued education while in Canada. None have obtained permanent residency.\n\nAll are alleged associates of a criminal group in Punjab and neighboring Haryana state that is associated with notorious Punjabi gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, currently held in India's high-security Sabarmati prison in Ahmedabad, in Gujarat, according to sources close to the investigation.\n\nBishnoi is accused by the Indian government of the shooting murder of Punjabi singer-politician Sidhu Moose Wala, a former resident of Brampton, Ont., in Punjab in May 2022, as well as drug smuggling and extortion.\n\nBishnoi was one of two jailed Indian gangsters who claimed responsibility on social media for Gill's killing last September, describing it as revenge for a previous gangland killing in India, according to widespread Indian media reports.\n\nIndia has long alleged that Punjabi gangsters are able to use Canada as a base to squeeze money from business owners and others in India, relying on an army of low-paid gunmen to act as collectors and enforcers back home.\n\nAccording to both an unsealed U.S. federal indictment and Canadian investigators, the Indian government itself took advantage of those criminal networks to go after its enemies in Canada and the U.S. -- enemies such as Nijjar and Khalistani activist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, reportedly the target of an unsuccessful assassination plot in the U.S.\n\nPannun was the key organizer behind a series of independence votes in the Sikh diaspora. While the votes had no legal effect, they reportedly infuriated the Modi government.\n\nNijjar was targeted by India because of his role in helping to organize the votes in Canada's Sikh community, according to Canadian sources and the U.S. indictment.\n\nOne source close to the investigation told CBC News Canada is seeing foreign governments, including India, make use of criminal elements to carry out international operations.\n\n\"Why risk sending Indian government people when you can get so much mileage using people from organized crime?\" the investigator said.\n\nBut while the investigation is probing possible connections between Nijjar's killing and the Gill and Uppal cases, investigators are not convinced the Indian government was involved in the latter two.\n\nInvestigators say the Edmonton and Winnipeg killings may have had more to do with gangland rivalries and vendettas.\n\nThe U.S. indictment alleges an Indian government employee contracted a criminal to target enemies in North America.\n\nOn June 30, 2023, Czech authorities acting on a U.S. warrant arrested alleged Indian drug trafficker Nikhil \"Nick\" Gupta. On Nov. 30 he was indicted in the U.S. for allegedly helping an unnamed Indian government official hire a hitman to kill an unnamed Sikh independence activist in New York, reported to be Pannun, widely considered India's number one target.\n\nIt was the Drug Enforcement Administration, rather than the FBI, that stumbled onto the U.S.-based conspiracy while investigating Gupta in a narcotics case.\n\nGupta didn't know that the contact he asked to help him find a hitman was in fact a confidential informant of the DEA, the U.S. indictment alleges. Gupta has denied the charges and is facing extradition to the United States. He has not been tried.\n\nThe U.S. indictment also referred to Canadian cases. It alleged the unnamed Indian government employee told Gupta the Nijjar killing had accelerated the timetable for the assassination in New York -- \"It's [a] priority now,\" he allegedly texted.\n\nGupta allegedly sent his supposed contract killer a video of Nijjar's body and told him to \"do it quickly.\"\n\nThe U.S. indictment says Gupta told the police informant in an audio call that they had \"four jobs\" to finish before June 29 -- one in New York and \"three in Canada.\"\n\nThe publication of court documents in his case was one of a number of incidents that concerned Canadian investigators, who watched closely to see what effect the revelations might have on their own surveillance targets in Canada.\n\nWhile the prime minister and U.S. authorities have pointed the finger at the Indian government, Canadian investigators have struggled with the question of how high up the Indian chain of command they should pursue charges.\n\nInvestigators long ago dismissed the notion that India's overseas assassination campaign is a rogue operation, as the Indian government has maintained.\n\nThey say they believe that Indian officials would not dare to proceed with assassinations in Western countries without official sanction. As CBC News has previously reported, Canadian government sources say Canada have evidence of communications between Indian government officials in India and Canada in the course of their investigation.\n\nThe arrests come as Indians go to the polls in a national election that takes several weeks of voting to produce a result, expected on June 4. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to win a third term in office.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Death squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guru Nanak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canadians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

Sikh Gurdwara Council and a friend of Nijjar, said the root of the issue -- the Indian government -- had not been addressed.\n\n\"The bigger question looming is still India. The suppression of the Khalistan movement in Canada has been a long-standing piece for them for 40 years. This is a bit of a validation and vindication for the community that has been saying for 40 years that India is interfering, and we need to be aware of them,\" Singh said.\n\n\"It's unfortunate it took the assassination of a Sikh leader on Canadian soil for us to get here, though.\"\n\nIndia opposes the pro-Khalistan movement but has denied that it was involved in the killing of Nijjar. An Indian commission looking into a separate U.S. plot, which was foiled, determined that \"rogue operatives\" of the Indian government were responsible for the scheme, according to media reports.\n\nOn Saturday, India's foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, was asked how the country is responding to the promotion of Khalistan abroad.\n\n\"Our biggest problem right now is in Canada, because in Canada, actually today the party in power in Canada ... [has] given these kind of extremism, separatism, advocates of violence a certain legitimacy in the name of free speech,\" he said. India has long accused Canada of being lax on separatists.\n\nJaishankar also said India would wait for more information from police in Canada about the men arrested.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that Canada maintained a \"fundamental commitment to protecting all of its citizens.\"\n\n\"I know that many Canadians, particularly members of the Sikh community, are feeling uneasy and perhaps even frightened right now. Well, every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free from discrimination and threats of violence in Canada,\" he said.\n\nThe news of the arrests on Friday came on the same day as the first report of the inquiry into foreign interference in Canadian elections was released. In the report, Commissioner Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue said India had meddled in both the 2019 and 2021 federal elections and that the focus of Indian foreign interference was primarily around diaspora communities here.\n\n\"India views part of these communities as fostering an anti-India sentiment, and represents a threat to Indian stability and national security,\" the report reads. \"India does not differentiate between lawful, pro-Khalistani political advocacy and the relatively small Canada-based Khalistani violent extremism.\"\n\nHogue wrote that a network of Indian officials and \"Canada-based proxies\" are aiming to influence Canadian communities and politicians. The report does not mentioned the Nijjar killing.\n\nIn a separate interview Sunday on Rosemary Barton Live, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the safety of Canadians was of paramount importance to the government.\n\n\"I think we need to have confidence that the RCMP will do the work, and those responsible for the killing of this Canadian citizen on Canadian soil will be held to account and face the justice system,\" he told Barton.\n\n\"We've known for some some time that the Indian government and proxy agents of the Indian government were seeking to interfere in democratic processes in Canada.\"\n\nPolice would only say on Friday that there are ongoing investigations into the link between the Nijjar killing and the role of the Indian government.\n\n\"Often, these agents of a foreign government use the Canadian diaspora community, Canadian citizens, as the targets of this kind of interference.

However, India has vehemently dismissed these allegations as baseless. Nijjar was a designated terrorist by the Indian government.\n\nMeanwhile, reacting to the recent developments India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar downplayed the situation, attributing it to Canada's internal politics rather than any Indian involvement. He noted that pro-Khalistan factions in Canada were leveraging the country's democratic processes to gain political influence, causing challenges for both nations.\n\nJaishankar highlighted India's efforts to dissuade Canada from providing visas or political legitimacy to pro-Khalistan activists, citing extradition requests for 25 individuals, most of whom are pro-Khalistan, which went unheeded. He criticised Canada's lack of cooperation in sharing evidence and police collaboration, attributing the situation to political motives ahead of the upcoming Canadian elections.\n\nALSO READ: Villagers Lynch Youth For 'Sacrilege' At Punjab Gurdwara, Akal Takht Seeks Social Boycott Of Deceased's Family\n\n\"Canada did not give any proof.

This illustrates once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism and violence,\" said the Ministry of External Affairs in a statement.\n\nTrudeau as well as opposition leader Pierre Poilievre attended the Khalsa Day celebrations in Toronto on Sunday (Apr 28) where loud chants of pro-Khalistan slogans were raised.\n\nAs the Canadian prime minister was set

Clarke, research director at The Soufan Group, a U.S.-based security consulting group, and co-author of a paper on India and the Nijjar killing.\n\nThe lack of consequences for targeting diasporas has emboldened governments, who are rarely held to account, he said. \"People are doing it because they think they can get away with it.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guru Nanak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Global News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Jainism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Jainism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/CP167443994.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

We are not able to make any comments on the nature of evidence... Nor can we speak behind the motive of murder of Nijjar...

First responding members located a man, later identified as Hardeep Singh Nijjar, suffering from fatal gunshot wounds inside a vehicle.\n\nThe Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) has been carrying out the investigation. It has continued to work closely with a number of partner agencies and support services across Canada, as far east as Ontario, including the Surrey RCMP, the Alberta RCMP and other Lower Mainland Integrated Teams.\n\nThe Canadian police have not given any evidence of any link to India as was being speculated in Canadian media.\n\nNijjar's killing triggered diplomatic tensions between Canada and India after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of being involved in the killing -- a claim which India has rejected as \"absurd.\"\n\nThe video of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March this year showed Nijjar being shot by armed men in what has been described as a \"contract killing\".

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ethan CairnsSURREY, B.C. - Homicide police in British Columbia say they will be providing a \"significant update\" on the killing of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, amid reports that arrests have been made in the case. Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc says he has been informed about the update by the RCMP in the case that triggered allegations by Ottawa of Indian government involvement in the killing last year. He says the case \"likely and very clearly will end up before criminal courts.\" The CBC has reported that alleged members of a hit squad were arrested and that investigators are looking into possible links with three other killings. Nijjar, who had campaigned for a separate Sikh homeland in India, was gunned down in his vehicle outside his gurdwara in Surrey, B.C., last June. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in the House of Commons in September that there was credible intelligence linking the killing to the Indian government, touching off a diplomatic row that resulted in India suspending the issuing of visas to Canadians for two months. India has repeatedly denied involvement in Nijjar's death.

Jaishankar attributed the developments in poll-bound Canada mostly to 'internal politics.' Jaishankar said that it has nothing to do with India, adding that the section of pro-Khalistan people are using Canada's democracy, creating a lobby, and have become a vote bank.\n\nJaishankar was in Odisha when, replying to a question by a senior journalist on why Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is criticising India, he stated, \"India's image globally is now actually much higher than it had been ever... Canada is an exception. You see the different country heads are praising Bharat and its Prime Minister,\" reported PTI.\n\nHe also remarked that there is a need for a strong and proactive Prime Minister like Narendra Modi in the country to drive reforms across various sectors, including external affairs, to make way for a \"Viksit Bharat.\".\n\nIndia's diplomatic relations with Canada are facing tensions following Canadian PM Trudeau's allegations in September last year suggesting a political involvement of India in the killing of Nijjar on Canadian soil. India has refuted any such claims, calling them 'absurd' and 'motivated'.\n\nThe EAM said that Canada did not give any proof or share any evidence and police agencies do not cooperate with us. \"It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India. As elections are coming in Canada, they indulge in vote-bank politics,\" Jaishankar added.\n\nNijjar, aged 45, was fatally shot in June outside a Gurdwara in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb known for its significant Sikh community. Several months later, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of involvement, triggering a diplomatic rift with New Delhi. The three individuals, all Indian citizens, were apprehended by the police in Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday.

Nijjar succumbed to his injuries at the scene.\n\nAssistant commissioner David Teboul, commander of the federal policing program in the Pacific region, said police would not be able to speak about the \"nature of the evidence\" collected by police, nor the motive behind the killing.\n\n\"I will say this matter is still very much under active invetigation,\" he said. \"I will underscore that today's announcements are not a complete account of the investigative work currently underway.\"\n\nDays after the shooting, Sgt. Timothy Pierotti of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) shared details of two suspects. According to investigators, the suspects -- who were wearing face coverings -- ran southbound on 122 Street, through Cougar Creek Park and onto 121 Street after the incident. A getaway vehicle was possibly waiting for them upon their arrival.\n\nREAD MORE: Two heavy-set suspects ran through park after Surrey temple president's shooting, IHIT says\n\nAccording to the Nijjar family, the temple president had been meeting with Canadian Security Intelligence Service officers regularly before his death, as threats against him were mounting. Balraj Nijjar said his father was told about the threats and was advised to stay home.\n\nNijjar was also a vocal advocate for the Khalistan movement, which advocates for a separate Sikh homeland in Punjab, India, which led to accusations against him of terrorism and separatism by the government.\n\nREAD MORE: CSIS warned B.C.

The president was also told to avoid going to the gurdwara at his usual times and should avoid being seen in public, Pannun said.\n\nBut Balraj said his father did not want to hide.\n\nWhile the Indian government has denied involvement in Nijjar's death, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in September 2023 that there was \"credible\" information linking India to the killing.\n\nThis story is currently developing.

We have been telling Canada that these are wanted criminals from India, you are giving them visa; many have come on false documentation, and yet you allow them to live there. If you decide to import people with negative backgrounds there will be issues.\n\n\"If something has happened there, it is for them to worry about,\" he added.\n\nHe also said that the Khalistani elements have organised themselves politically in Canada and become a political lobby.\n\n\"And in some of these democratic countries the politicians of those countries are made to believe that if they defer to these people or pander to these people, these people have some ability to get the community to support them,\" he said, in reference to Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, who has taken the support of NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, who is a Khalistan sympathiser. Canada is known to have the second highest Sikh population in the world, after India, at over 770,000, or about two percent of its total population.\n\nEAM said these separatist elements \"have tried to create space for themselves in the politics of these countries\".\n\n\"At this time, I would say it is not so much of a problem in the US; our biggest problem right now is in Canada. Because in Canada, actually, the party in power in Canada, other parties in Canada, have given these kinds of extremism, separatism and advocates of violence a certain legitimacy, in the name of free speech.\"\n\nOn India taking a hard stance on Canada's backing of the separatists, he said:\n\n\"The point they need to understand, this is no longer a world which runs as a one-way street, that if there are things that happen out there, there will be pushback; the Newtons law of politics will apply there also. There will be a reaction, others will take steps to counter it.\"\n\nOn Friday, Canadian police said they had arrested three men who they claim are members of a \"hit squad\" that investigators believe was \"tasked by the Indian government\" with killing of prominent Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, British Columbia in June last year, CBC News reported.\n\nThe three, Kamalpreet Singh, Karanpreet Singh and Karan Brar, face first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the Nijjar case, according to documents filed in a Surrey court on Friday.\n\nThey are said to be associates of a criminal group in Punjab and neighboring Haryana state that is associated with notorious Punjabi gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, currently held in India's high-security Sabarmati prison in Ahmedabad, in Gujarat, according to sources close to the investigation, CBC said.\n\nUNI RN", "source": {"uri": "uniindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

They are accused of being the shooter, driver and lookout on the day Nijjar was killed.\n\nThey were arrested by police in Edmonton, in the neighboring province of Alberta, where they reside, and are being held behind bars pending further proceedings.\n\nAll had been in Canada for between three and five years, police said at a news conference on Friday.\n\nNijjar, who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015, advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India.\n\nHe was wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, he was shot dead by masked assailants in the parking lot of the Sikh temple he lead in suburban Vancouver.\n\nTrudeau announced several months later that Canada had \"credible allegations\" linking Indian intelligence to the killing and expelled an Indian official, spurring the diplomatic tit-for-tat with New Delhi.\n\nIn November, the US Justice Department charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on American soil.\n\nProsecutors said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning.\n\nThe shock allegations came after US President Joe Biden hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a rare state visit, as Washington seeks closer ties with India against growing China's growing influence.\n\nUS intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India's top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, the Washington Post reported this week.\n\nCanada is home to some 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two percent of the country's population, with a vocal minority calling for creating an independent state of Khalistan.\n\nThe Sikh separatist movement is largely finished within India, where security forces used deadly force to put down an insurgency in the state of Punjab in the 1980s.\n\nbur-gen-st/mlm/des/tjj/acb\n\nMore from this section\n\nTension grows on UCLA campus as police order dispersal of large pro-Palestinian gathering Compton Kids Learn the Truth About Drugs

The Canadian Sikh leader was gunned down almost a year ago in British Columbia.\n\nMoninder Singh lost his friend of 15 years last June outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population.\n\nThe 45-year-old's death rocked Canada's Sikh community. A few months later, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau triggered a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi when he cited evidence of Indian government involvement in Nijjar's death.\n\nOn Friday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police laid murder charges against three Indian men in connection with Nijjar's death and said they were probing possible ties to the Indian government.\n\nThe Indian mission in Ottawa did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe arrests are \"bittersweet,\" Moninder Singh told Reuters Friday afternoon.\n\n\"It's a relief that the investigation is moving forward. At the same time, it's still raising a lot of questions,\" said Singh, a spokesperson for the B.C. Gurdwaras Council.\n\nNijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labeled Nijjar a \"terrorist\" in 2020.\n\nAs Canada scrutinizes foreign interference in its elections, Singh called for a separate inquiry focusing solely on Indian interference in Canadian affairs.\n\nHe and other Sikh Canadian leaders told Reuters Canada has taken Indian interference more seriously since Nijjar's death.\n\n\"I think that Canada has been soft on Indian interference for the past four decades. The Canadian Sikh community has had to bear the brunt of it,\" said Balpreet Singh, legal counsel for the World Sikh Organization.\n\nBut Nijjar's death represents \"the undermining of (Canada's) sovereignty at a very, very different level,\" Moninder Singh said.\n\nNijjar is missed on a community, a family and a personal level, his friend said.\n\n\"He was such a strong leader, and a strong voice ... I've mistakenly called him since he passed away and sent him messages and it takes me a second to realize what I've done.\"\n\nBut Nijjar would not want his community to live in fear, Singh said.\n\n\"His death has brought about such huge momentum to galvanize the community,\" he said.\n\n\"I think his expectation is, don't let them strike fear into you.\"\n\n(Reporting by Anna Mehler Paperny; Editing by Kim Coghill)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

As per a report by Canadian media house CBC, the names of the persons arrested are Kamalpreet Singh, Karanpreet Singh and Karan Brar, all Sikh names.\n\nThe report also mentions that the three are members of a group which is associated with the gangster Lawrence Bishnoi. Notably, as per the NIA, Lawrence Bishnoi, Goldy Brar and several other gangsters have close links with the proscribed Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) and several other pro-Khalistani terrorist outfits.\n\nThis points towards the possibility that the murder of the Khalistani terrorist was the result of an inter-gang rivalry among Khalistanis, and not the work of the Indian government as alleged by Justin Trudeau government. However, CBC claimed that they were tasked by the government of India to kill Hardeep Singh Nijjar, without citing any evidence for the same.\n\nAs per the report by the Canadian public broadcaster, the three persons were arrested on Friday in police operations in at least two different provinces. \"Sources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance,\" the report stated.\n\nAs per the police, the members of the hit squad could be involved in at least three other murder cases, including the shooting of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nKamalpreet Singh, Karanpreet Singh and Karan Brar have been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the Nijjar murder case, as per documents submitted by the police at the court.

However, neither of them enrolled in any educational institution after arriving in Canada, and none of them obtained permanent residency.\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, the head of Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara Sahib and a wanted Khalistani terrorist in India, was shot dead in Surrey by unidentified assailants on June 18 this year in Surrey, British Columbia. On 18th September, in a bizarre move, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau blamed India for the murder, causing diplomatic relations between the two countries to nosedive. India categorically rejected the claims and urged the Canadian government to take strict action against anti-India elements on its soil.

This development unfolds amidst ongoing probes into potential ties with the Indian government.\n\nAs per court records cited by Canadian news outlet CTV News, Karanpreet Singh (28), Kamalpreet Singh (22), and Karan Brar (22) are each facing charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in connection with Nijjar's demise.\n\nHowever, India has consistently refuted these allegations. In September 2023, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stated that the Indian government had communicated to Canada that it does not engage in such acts, including the killing of Nijjar.\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing, RCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul, leading the Federal Policing Program in the Pacific Region, underscored the active status of the investigation into Nijjar's assassination. He refrained from discussing specifics of the evidence or the motive behind Nijjar's murder but emphasized the ongoing nature of the inquiry.\n\nTeboul further stated that investigations are underway into potential links with the government of India, alongside separate probes into the matter.\n\nAccording to indictments, the alleged conspiracy unfolded in both Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023, and the day of Nijjar's killing. Scheduled updates on the case from the BC RCMP and the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team were slated for 12:30 pm PT on Friday.\n\nNijjar's assassination sparked diplomatic tensions between Canada and India after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau disclosed intelligence investigations hinting at a possible connection between the Indian government and the killing.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc declined to confirm any links to the Indian government, directing inquiries to the RCMP. He expressed confidence in Canada's security apparatus and the diligent work of law enforcement agencies.\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, designated as a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was fatally shot outside a Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18, 2023. A video purportedly showing the killing emerged in March, depicting Nijjar being shot by armed individuals in what has been described as a 'contract killing.'\n\nTrudeau's assertions regarding India's alleged involvement in the assassination were rebuffed by India, leading to strained diplomatic relations between the two nations.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karan Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CTV News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIntegrated Homicide Investigation Team Supt. Mandeep Mooker said in a Surrey, B.C., news conference on Friday that the three men had been arrested in Edmonton that morning, and there may be more suspects and arrests as the investigation progresses.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We are investigating if there are any ties to the government of India,\" Mooker said. \"However ... it's an ongoing investigation, and I don't have any information to provide on that matter at this time.\"\n\nNijjar was shot and killed in his pickup truck last June as he left the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, touching off a wave of protests and rallies from local communities against diplomats from India.\n\nHe was the president of the gurdwara. Nijjar also campaigned for a separate Sikh homeland in India -- also known as Khalistan -- and organized unofficial referendums around the world about Punjabi independence.\n\nB.C. Gurdwaras Council spokesman Moninder Singh said he and Nijjar's family were briefed by investigators in Surrey about the arrests, and Nijjar's children were \"very emotional.\"\n\n\"At the moment, there is a bit of a sigh of relief in their father's murder,\" said Singh. \"There's a bit of anger and frustration around why this had to happen in the first place, and then there are a lot of questions around India.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Is this over? How do we go back into our community and have this conversation around is this safe or is it not safe?\"\n\nTrudeau said in September that there was credible intelligence linking Nijjar's killing to the Indian government, touching off a diplomatic row that resulted in India suspending issuing visas to Canadians for two months.\n\nIndia has repeatedly denied involvement in Nijjar's death.\n\nRCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said police in Canada have been trying to collaborate with Indian authorities on investigations such as the Nijjar case, an effort that began before his killing.\n\n\"I'll be frank, I'll characterize that collaboration as rather challenging and difficult for the last several years,\" Teboul said. \"However, the RCMP is very committed to continuing to establish a working relationship from law enforcement to law enforcement agency. So we're going to continue our efforts.\n\n\"But it's been difficult.\"\n\nPolice say the three suspects arrested in Nijjar's killing -- Karan Brar, Karanpreet Singh and Kamalpreet Singh -- are all male Indian nationals in their 20s living in Edmonton.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMooker said the men have been in Canada for three to five years as non-permanent residents but provided no other details on their immigration status.\n\nPolice say the three suspects are expected to be transported to B.C. by Monday to face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun is a New-York-based Sikh independence activist who U.S. prosecutors say was a target in an assassination plot directed by an Indian government official.\n\nHe said the arrests were \"a step forward\" but \"only scratch the surface.\"\n\n\"Shaheed Nijjar was my dear personal friend and close associate,\" Pannun said in a statement, using an honorific implying martyrdom. \"He was an upright individual, a peaceful man with demonstrated commitment to community service.\n\n\"Canadian politicians of every stripe must stand with the Canadian Sikhs' right to peacefully advocate for Khalistan without facing any violent retaliation from the Indian government.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFederal Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said in Ottawa that he understands that members of the Indo-Canadian community and others \"may still have questions or concerns,\" and asked that they \"put their trust in the justice system.\"\n\n\"Every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free of threats of violence,\" LeBlanc said without taking questions, adding that his department will engage with community groups in the coming days.\n\n\"We want to hear their concerns and work with them to foster trust and open communications.\"\n\nIn a statement, the federal Opposition Conservatives said while they are glad arrests were made, the party wished the Canadian government could have foiled the killing of Nijjar \"as was the case in the United States,\" a reference to the alleged assassination plot there.\n\nB.C. Premier David Eby said Nijjar's killing had \"shaken the Sikh community in British Columbia, the larger South Asian community, and Canadians across the country.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I hope that today's announcement of charges against three individuals is an important step towards justice for his family and accountability to the whole community,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe World Sikh Organization of Canada said it welcomed the news of the arrest of three members of an \"alleged hit squad that assassinated\" Nijjar.\n\nBut the group said in a statement that it believes the arrests raise disturbing questions about the connection between India's government and criminal gangs.\n\nIt noted that the report by the Foreign Interference Commission says India uses proxies in Canada who work with intelligence officials in Indian and Canada.\n\nAn interim report into foreign interference released Friday in Ottawa said Indian officials engaged in a range of activities to influence Canada's communities and politicians.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIt says India's interests in Canada related to the large South Asian community in the country.\n\n\"India does not differentiate between lawful, pro-Khalistani political advocacy and the relatively small Canada-based Khalistani violent extremism,\" the report says.\n\nIndian officials in Canada have increasingly relied on Canadian proxies and contacts in its network to conduct foreign interference, the report says.\n\n\"It views anyone aligned with Khalistani separatism as a seditious threat to India. Targets of Indian foreign interference are often members of the Indo-Canadian communities, but prominent non-Indo-Canadians are also subject to India's foreign influence activities.\"\n\n-- By Chuck

Quoting sources close to the investigation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that the police are actively investigating possible links to three additional murders in Canada, including the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nMembers of the hit squad are alleged to have played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey in British Columbia, according to the sources. The men were arrested Friday during police operations in at least two provinces.\n\nSources said investigators identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada some months ago and have been keeping them under tight surveillance. Police are expected to announce the arrests and share some details of their investigation later Friday, the report said.\n\nNijjar, a designated terrorist in India, was shot dead by two unidentified gunmen in British Columbia province on June 18 last year. Since Trudeau's allegations, India has suspended visa services for Canadians and previously expelled a senior Canadian diplomat in a tit-for-tat move.\n\nEarlier, a purported video footage of the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by the National Investigation Agency in 2020, surfaced online. In the video Nijjar is seen being shot by armed men in what has been described as a 'contract killing', Canada-based CBC News reported. The video showed Nijjar leaving the parking lot of the Gurdwara in his grey Dodge Ram pickup truck.\n\nAs he approached the exit, a white sedan pulled in front of him, blocking his truck. Two men then run up and shoot Nijjar before escaping in a silver Toyota Camry, CBC News reported. The two witnesses, who were playing soccer in a field nearby when the incident happened, revealed that they ran towards the place from where the gunshots were heard and also tried to chase the assailants.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)\n\nALSO READ | Canadian Foreign Minister left red-faced after query on evidence regarding Nijjar's killing | WATCH", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com",

Sikh Leader - Weekly Voice", "body": "The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) has apprehended the suspected hitmen accused of assassinating B.C. Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Three Indian nationals, Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh, and Karan Brar, have been charged with murder and conspiracy in connection with Nijjar's killing. The arrests come almost a year after Nijjar was fatally shot at the Guru Nanak Sikh Temple in Surrey, B.C. The suspects, who entered Canada on student visas, are believed to have been operating under the direction of Indian intelligence.\n\nThe investigation into Nijjar's murder remains active, with authorities looking into potential connections to the government of India. This case has raised concerns about the relationship between the Indian government and criminal elements, particularly in light of allegations suggesting a strategy to eliminate leaders of the Khalistan movement, which advocates for independence for Punjab state's Sikh-majority population.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau previously alluded to possible links between Nijjar's killing and Indian agents, leading to diplomatic tensions between Canada and India. The RCMP investigation is exploring whether Nijjar's assassination was part of an Indian intelligence operation targeting Khalistan advocates abroad.\n\nThe alleged involvement of India's Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), its foreign intelligence service, has prompted scrutiny of India's actions and motivations. Despite the challenges posed by diplomatic immunity for foreign officials, Canada is considering legal avenues to address the violation of its sovereignty and international law.\n\nThe arrests mark a significant development in the case, shedding light on the complex dynamics surrounding transnational repression and the pursuit of political objectives beyond national borders.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karan Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_Bureau_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence Bureau (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guru Nanak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_Analysis_Wing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and Analysis Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ezgif-3-41cae4ab57.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Turning the tables, EAM said that there's nothing to fear as if something happened in Canada, it is for them to worry about. Attacking further, Jaishankar accused Canada of giving space to extremism, separatism in the name of \"free speech\". EAM Jaishankar also slammed Ottawa for being silent on threats to Indian diplomats. Notably, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was a designated terrorist in India, was also a pro-Khalistan leader.

India reacted by saying those charges were \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" However, more recently, India has said it could cooperate if \"specific and relevant\" information was provided with regard to any Indian angle.\n\nThe arrests of three Indian citizens, Karan Brar, 22, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karanpreet Singh, 28, all residents of Edmonton, capital of the province of Alberta, were announced by the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team or IHIT on Friday.

Nijjar also campaigned for a separate Sikh homeland in India -- also known as Khalistan -- and organized unofficial referendums around the world about Punjabi independence.\n\nB.C. Gurdwaras Council spokesman Moninder Singh said he and Nijjar's family were briefed by investigators in Surrey about the arrests, and Nijjar's children were \"very emotional.\"\n\n\"At the moment, there is a bit of a sigh of relief in their father's murder,\" said Singh. \"There's a bit of anger and frustration around why this had to happen in the first place, and then there are a lot of questions around India.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Is this over? How do we go back into our community and have this conversation around is this safe or is it not safe?\"\n\nTrudeau said in September that there was credible intelligence linking Nijjar's killing to the Indian government, touching off a diplomatic row that resulted in India suspending issuing visas to Canadians for two months.\n\nIndia has repeatedly denied involvement in Nijjar's death.\n\nRCMP Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said police in Canada have been trying to collaborate with Indian authorities on investigations such as the Nijjar case, an effort that began before his killing.\n\n\"I'll be frank, I'll characterize that collaboration as rather challenging and difficult for the last several years,\" Teboul said. \"However, the RCMP is very committed to continuing to establish a working relationship from law enforcement to law enforcement agency. So we're going to continue our efforts.\n\n\"But it's been difficult.\"\n\nPolice say the three suspects arrested in Nijjar's killing, Karan Brar, Karanpreet Singh and Kamalpreet Singh are all male Indian nationals in their 20s living in Edmonton.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMooker said the men have been in Canada for three to five years as non-permanent residents but provided no other details on their immigration status.\n\nPolice say the three suspects are expected to be transported to B.C. by Monday to face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun is a New-York-based Sikh independence activist who U.S. prosecutors say was a target in an assassination plot directed by an Indian government official.\n\nHe said the arrests were \"a step forward\" but \"only scratch the surface.\"\n\n\"Shaheed Nijar was my dear personal friend and close associate,\" Pannun said in a statement, using an honorific implying martyrdom. \"He was an upright individual, a peaceful man with demonstrated commitment to community service.\n\n\"Canadian politicians of every stripe must stand with the Canadian Sikhs' right to peacefully advocate for Khalistan without facing any violent retaliation from the Indian Government.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe World Sikh Organization of Canada echoed those sentiments, saying it welcomed the news of the arrest of three members of an \"alleged hit squad that assassinated\" Nijjar.\n\nBut the group said in a statement that it believes the arrests raise disturbing questions about the connection between India's government and criminal gangs.\n\nIt noted that the report by the Foreign Interference Commission says India uses proxies in Canada who work with intelligence officials in Indian and Canada.\n\nAn interim report into foreign interference released Friday in Ottawa said Indian officials engaged in a range of activities to influence Canada's communities and politicians.\n\nIt says India's interests in Canada related to the large South Asian community in the country.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"India does not differentiate between lawful, pro-Khalistani political advocacy and the relatively small Canada-based Khalistani violent extremism,\" the report says.\n\nIndian officials in Canada have increasingly relied on Canadian proxies and contacts in its network to conduct foreign interference, the report says.\n\n\"It views anyone aligned with Khalistani separatism as a seditious threat to India. Targets of Indian foreign interference are often members of the Indo-Canadian communities, but prominent non-Indo-Canadians are also subject to India's foreign influence activities.\"\n\n-- By Chuck

Nijjar had a Canadian passport. The global interest was on whether the trio was tied to the Indian security establishment. The news break came days after the Washington Post claimed to have outed an R&AW operative as the handler of a botched attempt to bump off another Khalistani radical in the US, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.\n\nHowever, the Canadian police gave little away, merely claiming a larger ring was under the scanner and they were looking into their Indian establishment linkage.

They are speculated to have entered Canada on student visas. The trio played different roles as shooters, drivers and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed. Canada is yet to share any information with India, foreign minister S Jaishankar said.\n\nBilateral relations hit an all-time low after Canadian PM Justin Trudeau flagged the Nijjar case in his talks with PM Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in New Delhi without sharing an iota of evidence.

Under section 231 (1) of Canada's criminal code, they face a minimum sentence of 25 years, if they are convicted. However, the allegations against them have to be proven in court.\n\nAll three are believed to be affiliated with the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, which appears to have an extensive network in Canada and has been linked to instances of drive-by shootings and extortion in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, Edmonton and the Greater Toronto Area or GTA. Among his principal lieutenants in North America is Satinderjeet Singh, better known as gangster Goldy Brar, who is wanted in connection with the murder of entertainer and politician Sidhu Moose Wala in May 2022. Brar, who was featured on Canada's Top 20 Most Wanted fugitives list last year, is believed to have been residing in Brampton in the GTA before shifting to Northern California.\n\nNijjar's murder in the parking lot of the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara Sahib, where he was president at the time of his death, ruptured relations between India and Canada, including scuttling advanced negotiations towards an Early Progress Trade Agreement or EPTA, after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's statement in the House of Commons three months after the incident that there were credible allegations of a potential link between Indian agents and the homicide.\n\nThat connection has not yet been established by the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team or IHIT, tasked with the probe. But as Trudeau and investigators have said, that effort is \"ongoing\" along with attempts to track down at least three others who may have been involved in the killing.\n\nWhen news first broke on the late evening of June 18, 2023, that officers from the Surrey detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or RCMP \"found an adult male inside a vehicle suffering from apparent gunshot wounds\", after receiving information that regard at approximately 8.27 pm, it would have been difficult to predict the incident's diplomatic repercussions.\n\nBut Nijjar was a contentious figure, often the topic of conversations between India and Canada, as New Delhi had designated him a terrorist on July 1, 2020, as the Canada-based chief of Khalistan Tiger Force. He was wanted on charges of terrorism in India, including for conspiracy to murder a priest Kamaldeep Sharma in Jalandhar in January 2021.\n\nWhen officials from the National Investigation Agency or NIA met their Canadian counterparts in New Delhi and Ottawa in 2021 and 2022, he was a major point of conversation for the former. Indian officials often expressed frustration at the lack of Canadian action, while the latter said they could not proceed as the information provided did not meet the evidentiary threshold of the country's justice system.\n\nNone of the charges against him were ever tested in a Canadian court, though he was placed on an American no-fly list. He was briefly detained in April 2018 by Canadian law enforcement but released without any charges. At that time, he said he was \"targeted and framed in false criminal cases by Indian authorities.\" While he had been working as a plumber, in 2019, he became president of the Surrey Gurdwara.\n\nNijjar was also the principal organiser of the so-called Khalistan Referendum in British Columbia for the secessionist group Sikhs for Justice. He arrived in Canada in 1997 using a forged passport but his refugee claim was denied the next year. However, he remained in Canada and started propagating the separatist cause. An Interpol Red Notice was issued for him in 2014 and 2016 at India's request but he had somehow become a Canadian citizen in 2007. That was apparently due to lobbying by an Indo-Canadian MP though that can't be confirmed.\n\nBut events across Canada's southern border have underscored the serious nature of the allegations over Nijjar's murder. Last year, an indictment in a Federal court in New York was unsealed revealing an unsuccessful plot to kill Nijjar's close friend and SFJ's general counsel Gurpatwant Pannun.\n\nThe American documents pointed to an Indian official allegedly directing gangster Nik Gupta to facilitate Pannun's killing but that plan went awry as the person he contacted was an undercover American operative. But Nijjar's killing was specifically mentioned in the American indictment giving substance to Trudeau's allegation against India, which New Delhi had described as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\"\n\nMatters could get further complicated in Canada as a recent Washington Post report alleged the involvement of India's Consulate General in Vancouver in targeting Nijjar. No evidence has been provided but SFJ, which has seen itself gaining increasing influence in Canadian affairs, and other pro-separatist elements in Canada, have amplified that charge. India's diplomats will remain under pressure as they have been since last summer when SFJ started its Wanted campaign against them.\n\nIndian officials have stressed that relations with Ottawa are unlikely to improve till Trudeau remains in office, which is at least till October next year when Federal elections are scheduled. A change in Government in New Delhi, they said, will make little difference to India's posture, which was articulated by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who described Canada as the \"biggest problem\" while speaking at an event in Bhubaneshwar on Saturday, adding that Canadian leaders had given \"these kinds of extremism, separatism, advocates of violence a certain legitimacy, in the name of free speech.\"\n\nThat was proven again on Sunday, as pro-Khalistan elements paraded a float in Malton in the Greater Toronto Area or GTA showing Prime Minister Narendra Modi chained in a cage for Nijjar's murder, amid separatist chants, like those that greeted Trudeau when we spoke at a Khalsa Day event in Toronto the previous Sunday.\n\nIt remains to be seen if India's Prime Minister receives an invitation to attend the G7 heads of government summit, which Canada will host in the fall of 2025. As a former Indian diplomat to Ottawa said, \"We may not have seen the worst yet.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Last June, Bhai Nijjar, a Sikh activist, was tragically assassinated in Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's later assertion before the Canadian Parliament, implicating the Indian government in Nijjar's killing. The arrests follow months of investigation into the high-profile case, which has drawn international attention and raised concerns about India's transnational repression against Sikhs.\n\nContrary to Indian government propaganda, which attempts to link Sikh freedom movements with criminal elements, the arrests in the Nijjar case suggest a different narrative. Sources close to the investigation reveal that the arrested individuals are alleged associates of Lawrance Bishnoi gang. Gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, currently incarcerated in a jail in Gujarat state of India, from where he is believed to have been operating his gang.\n\nAs per the CBC, sources close to the investigation say that the arrested individuals are believed to be associated with a hit squad involved in Nijjar's assassination. Roles within the squad ranged from shooters to drivers and spotters, with the fatal incident occurring at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey.\n\nThe trio -- identified as Kamalpreet Singh, Karanpreet Singh, and Karan Brar -- now face first-degree murder and conspiracy charges, as outlined in documents filed in a Surrey court.\n\nReports from CBC News reveal that the suspects entered Canada on temporary visas post-2021, some holding student visas. Despite this, none of them are believed to have pursued educational endeavors during their stay, and none have obtained permanent residency status.\n\nThe assessination of Bhai Hardeep Singh Nijjar, coupled with a foiled assassination plot targeting Sikh activist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the USA, has shed light on concerns regarding India's transnational repression tactics. Both Canada and the USA have emphasized the violation of their sovereignty through such actions and attempts.\n\nAs the investigation into Nijjar's murder continues and legal proceedings unfold, questions surrounding the case's complexities and its broader implications persist.\n\nWhile the Ministry of External Affairs of India asserts that assassinations are not part of the government's policy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been claiming responsibility for such acts on foreign soil during his elections rallies in India. He attributes these actions to his administration's vision of a \"new India,\" adding that new India eliminates its adversaries even outside its borders.", "source": {"uri": "sikhsiyasat.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sikh Siyasat News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Bishnoi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Brar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karan Brar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guru Nanak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_residency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Permanent residency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://sikhsiyasat.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Hardeep-Singh-Nijjar.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.592156862745098, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

According to court documents, Karanpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22 and Karan Brar, 22, have been charged with first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in Nijjar's death.\n\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun, Attorney at Law (New York) and General Counsel to SFJ, said: \"Shaheed Nijar was my dear, personal friend and a close associate. He was head of the Khalistan Referendum campaign in Canada and President of a Gurdwara in Surrey, BC. He was an upright individual, a peaceful man with a demonstrated commitment to community service.\"\n\nThe Sikh leader, who lives under security around the clock, said: \"If we are to genuinely combat this wave of transnational violence, those Indian diplomats who oversee RAW's espionage operations in Canada must be held accountable and face legal proceedings.\n\nOnly through such decisive actions can we hope to dismantle the networks that enable and perpetuate such crimes against Canadians on Canadian soil.\n\n\"Canadian politicians of every stripe must stand with the Canadian Sikhs' right to peacefully advocate for Khalistan without facing any violent retaliation from the Indian Government. Canada's political leadership must stand on the right side of history in countering the Modi government's transnational repression of pro-Khalistan Sikhs on Canadian soil, to ensure this sort of violence never happens again.\"\n\nPannun added: \"Nijjar laid his life working for the cause of Khalistan, Phase III of Khalistan Referendum voting on July 28, 2024 in Calgary, AB is dedicated to Hardeep Singh Nijjar and other Canadians who sacrificed their lives for the cause of Khalistan.\"\n\nThe three India men arrested on Friday were living in the city of Edmonton, Alberta, and will be transported on Monday to British Columbia to face charges. The indictments allege the conspiracy was planned in both Surrey and Edmonton between 1 May and 18 June.\n\nBrian Edwards, RCMP assistant commissioner called the killing \"outrageous\" and \"reprehensible\", adding the investigators worked closely with members of the Sikh community.\n\n\"It had a profound impact on the residents of Surrey and, notwithstanding today the announcing of charges, those scars will remain in our community for a long time,\" he said.\n\nCanada's public safety minister said the arrests confirmed \"that the RCMP take these matters extremely seriously\".\n\n\"We remain dedicated to finding and arresting each one of these individuals,\" said Mooker.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors":

The media report further claimed that the arrested men are said to be alleged associates of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi.\n\nNotably, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in India previously established links between Lawrence Bishnoi's gang and pro-Khalistani groups that operate on foreign soil. Bishnoi is also accused of plotting the killing of popular singer Sidhu Moose Wala in May 2022.\n\nThis further points to the possibility that the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar can be the result of inter-gang rivalry between Khalistani outfits and the Lawrence Bishnoi gang.\n\nThe three arrested in the case face one count of first degree murder and a count of conspiracy to commit murder. The media report said that Canadian police are investigating the links between the alleged shooters and three additional killings in Canada.\n\nThe CBC reported that all three arrested in the case are in their 20s, and are Indian citizens who have been residing in Edmonton. The three were identified by Canadian authorities months ago and were being closely monitored.\n\nCanadian media reports suggest that investigative agencies are exploring the involvement of the Indian government in Nijjar's killing.

What they did say was that three Indian men had committed the killing and that an investigation into India's role was ongoing.\n\nBefore the arrests, Indian officials had maintained that Canada was trying to drag New Delhi into what it described as essentially a rivalry between gangs whose members were long wanted for crimes back in India.\n\nAfter the arrests, a report from the CBC, Canada's public broadcasting corporation, based on anonymous sources, also said the suspects belonged to an Indian criminal gang.\n\nBut analysts and former officials said that the possible role of a gang in the killing does not necessarily mean the Indian government was not involved in the crime.\n\nIndia's external spy agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, or RAW, has long been suspected of tapping into criminal networks to carry out operations in its immediate neighborhood in South Asia while maintaining deniability.\n\nCanada's accusation, if proven, that India orchestrated the Nijjar killing -- and a similar accusation made soon after by the United States in a different case -- may suggest that RAW is now extending its playbook of working with criminals to carry out operations in Western countries, analysts said.\n\nU.S. officials have produced strong evidence in their accusation that an agent of the Indian government participated in a foiled attempt to assassinate a dual American Canadian citizen. And Canada and allied officials have maintained that Canada has evidence supporting Trudeau's claim that Indian agents carried out Nijjar's killing.\n\nBut the Canadian failure to reveal any evidence that India took part, nine months after Trudeau's explosive allegation, leaves the killing of Nijjar in the realm of accusations and counteraccusation in what is a highly tense political environment in both countries, analysts said.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has been flexing his muscles as a nationalist strongman, pitching himself during his ongoing campaign for a third term in office as a protector of India who would go as far as it takes to target security threats.\n\nDuring speeches, he has boasted about how his government eliminates enemies by \"descending in their homes.\" While he has made those references in relation to the country's archenemy -- Pakistan -- right-wing accounts on social media had celebrated the slaying of Nijjar in Canada as a similar reach of Modi's long arm.\n\nTrudeau, on the other hand, had been facing criticism of weakness in the face of Chinese election interference activities on Canadian soil, and his getting ahead of the Nijjar killing was seen as compensating for that.\n\nCanadian police announced Friday that they had arrested the three Indian men in Edmonton, Alberta, the same day and charged them with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the killing of Nijjar. The suspects had been living in Canada for three to five years but were not permanent residents of Canada, the police said.\n\nThe gang the CBC reported that the hit men are connected to is led by Lawrence Bishnoi, 31, who is accused of several cases of murder, extortion and narcotics trafficking. He has orchestrated much of it from an Indian jail, where he has been held since 2014. His members are seen as being behind the murder of a popular Punjabi rapper, and threats of attacks on Bollywood celebrities.\n\nIndian security officials have frequently arrested criminals connected to Bishnoi, often with allegations that the gang's network stretched as far as Canada and overlapped with those promoting from Canadian soil the cause of Khalistan, a once deeply violent separatist movement with the goal of carving out the Indian state of Punjab as an independent nation.\n\nA large Sikh diaspora resides in Canada, many of them having migrated there after a violent and often indiscriminate crackdown by the Indian government in the 1980s against the movement for an independent Khalistan. While the cause has largely died down inside India, it continues to have supporters among some segments of the diaspora. The Indian government has accused Canada and several other Western countries of not doing enough to crack down on the separatists.\n\nAnalysts and former security officials said that in India's immediate geographic neighborhood, RAW has often been willing to venture into murky spaces to recruit killers. Senior officials of Modi's administration, including Ajit Doval, the storied former spymaster who now serves as his longtime national security adviser, have in the past been accused of reaching into the underworld to find hit men willing to go after targets inside the country as well as abroad.\n\nBishnoi has demonstrated enormous power from behind bars, even giving a television interview from jail last year to pitch himself as a nationalist warrior rather than a criminal mastermind. That, one former security official said, was a signal of his trying to align himself with the spirit of nationalism for a potential deal.\n\n\"I am a nationalist,\" Bishnoi said in that interview. \"I am against Khalistan. I am against Pakistan.\"\n\nAjai Sahni, a security analyst who runs the South Asia Terrorism Portal in New Delhi, said the exploitation of criminal gangs by spy agencies to carry out operations with deniability was something that \"happens all over the world.\"\n\n\"It is definitely possible for agencies like RAW to use gang rivalries instead of exposing their own covert operators,\" Sahni added. \"But just because that is generally how one would expect it to be done, it doesn't necessarily mean we know this is exactly the case in Nijjar's killing.\"\n\nThe failed plot on U.S. soil had some of the sloppy hallmarks of an agency trying to extend an old playbook into a different, unfamiliar space.\n\nA U.S. indictment in November laid out evidence, including electronic communication and cash transactions among the hired hit man -- who turned out to be an undercover cop -- a boastful middleman, and an Indian intelligence handler whom The Washington Post recently identified as Vikram Yadav.\n\nThe Indian government's response suggested worry: India's top diplomat said the action was not government policy, while the government announced an investigation into the matter and promised cooperation with the United States.\n\nCanada's case has played out very differently. The country has not publicly disclosed any evidence backing up Trudeau's claim, even as allied officials said in September that Canadian officials had found a \"smoking gun\": intercepted communications of Indian diplomats in Canada indicating involvement in the plot.\n\nIndian officials have pushed back against Trudeau's claims with the kind of aggression that suggested it either wasn't involved or that it was confident of its deniability.\n\nThe Indian government expelled Canadian diplomats and doubled down by putting out a list of individuals on Canadian soil it said were long wanted as part of what it described as a crime and terror nexus.\n\nLast week, officials in Modi's government jumped on scenes of an event that Trudeau had attended to say it showed his accusations were simply to appease what they say is a Sikh vote bank for him. They pointed to videos of an event where Trudeau was the chief guest and where chants of \"Long live Khalistan\" were shouted. Trudeau, in his speech, said he will always be there \"to protect your rights and your freedoms, and we will always defend your community against hatred.\"\n\nAfter the speech, the Indian foreign ministry summoned Canada's second highest-ranking diplomat in New Delhi to lodge a complaint.\n\n\"His remarks to us illustrates once again the kind of political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism and people who practice violence,\" Randhir Jaiswal, the foreign ministry spokesperson, said at a news conference.", "source": {"uri": "nytlicensing.com", "dataType": "news",

The latest trigger has come from a report in The Washington Post naming an Indian official involved in the plot to murder Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York. The US government has expressed concerns while Government of India (GoI) responds in its own way. At the same time, anti-India and pro-Khalistani utterances and activities in Canada have once again deeply upset GoI. Since India and the US are strategically coming closer and India and Canada would want to do so, the question is how to avoid disagreements on balancing individualliberty with peoples' security.\n\nIn reference to the Post'sreport, the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on 29 April to the journalists that one VikramYadav from Indian intelligence agency RAW contacted the Indian businessman Nikhil Gupta to get Pannun killed by a hired assassin. Gupta is currently in the custody of Czech Republic waiting deportation to USA. Yadav had the approval of SamantGoel, the Chief of RAW. Pannun is having dual citizenship of USA and Canada, one of the main leaders of Khalistani movement, and legal advisor and spokesperson for Sikhs for Justice, a Khalistani organisation based in Canada. India has declared Pannun as a terrorist.\n\nJean-Pierre said in the same press conference that, \"India is an important strategic partner of United States, and we are pursuing an ambitious agenda to expand our cooperation in several areas\". At the same time, she added, \"We expect accountability from Govt of India on that. We are going to raise our concerns directly with Indian government.\" The Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson said in his response, \"a high-level committee is looking into information shared by American side with us because it equally impacts our national security\". The Foreign Minister had endorsed this in his reply to Parliament on 7 December last year that a high-powered committee is looking into the material shared by United States.\n\nWhat is of curious importance is that the alleged plot to kill Pannun in US coincided with the 18 June 2023 killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey in Canada's British Columbia province.Intriguingly, that operation was also linked to Yadav according to western officials. This raised the western concern (Canada and US) about the escalating campaign of aggression against overseas Indians allegedly involved in anti-Indian activities, by Indian intelligence operations. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revealed in the Canadian Parliament on 18 September 2023 that there was 'potential involvement of Indian agencies in the killing of Nijjar'.\n\nTrudeau added that Canadian security agencies - Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and Canadian Security Intelligence Agency - had the evidence of India's involvement. He also reported that a fellow-member of Five-Eyes Alliance had shared similar information. Five-Eyes Alliance is an intelligence group comprising five Anglo sphere countries, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom. Govt of India at the time had rejected the allegations as absurd and motivated. India had accused Ottawa of harbouring Sikh separatists.\n\nJagmeet Singh, the President of the New Democratic Party, the third biggest party in Canada which props up the Trudeau government, came out in support of Trudeau's allegations of Indian officials' involvement, \"today we learned of allegations that agents of Indian government murdered Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian killed on Canadian soil. To all Canadians, this is my vow. I will leave no stone unturned in the pursuit of justice including holding NarendraModi accountable\".\n\nOnce again Govt of India was alarmed and agitated over raising of pro-Khalistani slogans at a public event at Toronto, attended by Justin Trudeau. This was the Khalsa Day organised by Sikhs in Canada on 28 April. As soon as Trudeau approached the podium, KhalistanZindabad slogans were raised. Trudeau was reportedly seen smiling at the chants of the slogan. Banners were also displayed which said 'Modi wanted'. The Sikhs for Justice portrayed huge bannersidentifying NarendraModi, Rajnath Singh and Jaishankar as killers of Nijjar. This organisation is a pro-Khalistani group which called for revenge against killing of Nijjar and had initiated violence against Indian diplomats.\n\nTrudeau's acquiescence in such pro-Khalistani slogans is 'understandable' as his government is surviving on the support of the New Democratic Party headed by Jagmeet Singh. This is a party whose support base consists of Khalistan-supporting Sikhs. Evidently, immigrants hankering nostalgically for their cultural roots,seek to recreate those in their adopted countries. If they fail to do so, they support the separatist and revivalist organisations in the countries of their origin. This is the case with large number of Sikhs in Canada. Having achieved material prosperity and lost their cultural identity, they tend to become reactionary in their approach.\n\nLast year, in the British Labour Party conference, I happened to run into a Sikh guest delegate from Canada who was a Member of Parliament from the New Democratic Party. In our conversation, he said that Nijjar was an innocent ordinary Sikh eking his livelihood from priestly activities in Gurudwaras. I was shocked to learn that a terrorist was perceived by Canadian Sikhs as a simple and ordinary person.\n\nThe Govt of India summoned the Deputy High Commissioner of Canada in New Delhi and strongly protested the patronage given to anti-India elements in Canada. The MEA said, \"It illustrated once again the space given in Canada to separatism, extremism and violence. It encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada which will prove detrimental to its own citizens\". Trudeau's complicity in pro-Khalistani activities may go well with his vote-bank politics and alliance government. But it is certainly not advisable, nor acceptable in bilateral relations. How would Canada, for that matter United States react, if Govt of India were to encourage forces in India that attempt to create divisions and violence in their countries.\n\nClearly, USA and Canada are missing the link between freedom at home and acts of terrorism abroad. Whether Indian agencies were involved in murder of wanted criminals in other countries, is a matter of investigation. What is however baffling is the duplicity maintained by Canada as well as United States. Trudeau should not miss the link between politics at home and foreign policy. A kind of politics that conduces Trudeau, should not be causing violence in other countries. Likewise, United States and its close allies like Israel can take out their enemies in other countries; Israel's intelligence agency Mossad has done it in several countries, and the stark example of USA doing so is killing Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan.\n\nQuite a few human rights experts argue that, given the justice system in USA, Osama should have been captured and tried. This is not the debate we will engage in, but the fact to underline is Osama Bin Laden was responsible for Twin Tower terrorist attack killing innocent people. USA militarily moved to Afghanistan and chased Osama into Pakistan. If any other country were to do a similar act of chasing and killing terrorists, why should USA object? -", "source": {"uri": "dailyexcelsior.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jammu Kashmir Latest

Teboul said the investigation is ongoing and includes \"investigating connections to the Government of India.\"\n\nNijjar was fatally shot by masked gunmen in a Vancouver suburb in June 2023 in an incident that sparked international controversy and led to a souring of diplomatic relations between Canada and India.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in September said authorities were investigating Indian government agents' links to the killing, allegations New Delhi dismissed as \"absurd.\"\n\nIt comes after US authorities last year foiled a planned assassination of a Sikh separatist on American soil that Western officials believe was linked to India's spy agency, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe planned assassination by India's spy agency of a New York-based Sikh activist stunned Western security officials and \"reflects a profound shift in geopolitics,\" an investigation by the Washington Post found.\n\nIndia's intelligence services issued final instructions to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on a state visit to the White House in June last year, the Post reported.\n\nThe brazenness of the act reflects India's status as an emerging global power that the US cannot risk alienating, particularly given that Washington also needs a buffer against China's expansion in the Indo-Pacific region, the Post wrote.\n\nIndia risked attempting an assassination on US soil -- and during a state visit -- \"because they knew they could get away with it,\" a Western security official told the newspaper.\n\nSource: Foreign Affairs\n\nCompared with the 1980s and 90s when Sikh separatism had bloody consequences in India and elsewhere, the movement -- which wants to establish an independent state of Khalistan in the northwest Punjab region -- is no longer a legitimate security threat in India.\n\nBut Sikh opposition still poses a political hurdle for Modi and his goal to create \"a Hindu nation where Christians and Muslims are not equal citizens,\" Hartosh Singh Bal wrote for Foreign Affairs. Hindu nationalists regard Sikhism as a branch of Hinduism, he explained, so: \"When Sikhs protest Modi's policies, the Indian government cannot simply dismiss the demonstrators as foreign agents, as it does with Muslims. It has to listen.\" And after playing up the threat of Sikh separatists abroad, the Indian government has to act \"as if this were really the case,\" Bal argued.\n\nSources: The Washington Post, The Globe and Mail\n\nModi has leaned into accusations that his government sent agents to kill Canadians and other foreigners, turning them into taunts as he seeks reelection in India's weeks-long vote. \"Today, even India's enemies know: This is Modi, this is the New India,\" he said at an April 5 rally. \"This New India comes into your home to kill you.\"\n\nGlobe and Mail columnist Doug Saunders argued that Trudeau should ignore misguided suggestions that he should tolerate Modi's \"extrajudicial acts\" to maintain Canada's economic and trade relationship with India. \"Modi is not attacking a threat harbored within Canada, as he claims; he is attacking Canada's fundamental values of freedom of speech, pluralism and physical security,\" Saunders wrote, and that's why Trudeau should take

He noted that in some instances, these individuals have caused problems in their own countries due to their political activities, according to a report by Sputnik, a Russian media outlet.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has suggested that agents from the Indian government might have been involved in the death of pro-Khalistan figure Hardeep Singh Nijjar. However, recent reports indicate his death may have been due to conflicts between criminal gangs.\n\nOn Friday, May 3, Canadian authorities arrested three individuals believed to be part of a hit squad involved in the murder of Khalistani activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia last year.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police identified the suspects as 28-year-old Karanpreet Singh, 22-year-old Kamalpreet Singh, and 22-year-old Karan Brar.\n\n\"At the moment, we're examining any potential connections they may have to the Indian government,\" RCMP Superintendent Mandeep Mooker stated during a press conference.\n\nThe suspects in the hit squad allegedly took on different roles such as shooters, drivers, and lookouts during the assassination of Nijjar. They were captured earlier in the day during police raids across at least two provinces.\n\nAccording to a report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the individuals arrested are connected to the imprisoned Indian gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, suggesting that Nijjar's murder may have been the result of a gang feud. Police investigations reveal that the three entered Canada on student visas.\n\nNijjar, aged 45, was fatally shot on June 18, 2023, just after evening prayers at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey.\n\nMeanwhile, India's External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, has responded to the detention of three Indian nationals connected to Nijjar's murder in Canada last June.\n\n\"Some individuals may have been arrested, and there might have been investigations, but the reality is that numerous gang members and individuals with organized crime connections from Punjab have found refuge in Canada,\" Jaishankar stated during a press interaction in Bhubaneswar on the evening of Saturday, May 4.\n\nJaishankar mentioned that New Delhi has consistently alerted Canada about the risks of admitting criminals into their country.\n\nJaishankar pointed out that welcoming individuals with questionable and negative backgrounds for political reasons can lead to complications. He noted that in some instances, these individuals have caused problems in their own countries due to their political activities, according to a report by Sputnik, a Russian media outlet.\n\nIn the midst of his comments, it was mentioned by Jaishankar that India finds pro-Khalistan activism in Canada to be a significant issue.\n\nJaishankar pointed out that the main issue isn't in the US right now, but rather in Canada. He explained that the political parties currently in power in Canada have, to some extent, legitimized extremism and separatism under the guise of free speech. This has given advocates of violence a platform that they otherwise might not have.\n\nPro-Khalistan extremists have convinced Canadian politicians that supporting their cause could help them gain the entire community's backing, Jaishankar remarked.\n\nHe explained that these politicians believe that by pandering to these individuals, they can secure community support.\n\nFurthermore, he expressed deep concerns about the recent attacks and threats targeting Indian diplomatic missions, diplomats, and interests in Canada, highlighting the gravity of the situation.\n\nHe conveyed to the Canadian foreign minister the importance of considering their reaction if similar incidents were to happen to their diplomats, embassy, or flag. \"We have to keep our position strong,\" he emphasized.\n\nFormer Canadian Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier, leader of the People's Party of Canada (PPC), told Sputnik that India is the largest provider of immigrants to Canada. He noted that the rise in Sikh immigrants who carry their Khalistani activism with them is a concern for both social harmony in Canada and the country's friendly relations with India.\n\nBernier criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, accusing them of engaging in \"ethnic pandering\" to supporters of pro-Khalistan terrorism.\n\nIn a statement to Sputnik, it was observed that Canadian politics appears to be increasingly leaning toward ethnic pandering. Mainstream politicians, including Justin Trudeau and Pierre Poilievre, were highlighted for wearing ethnic garb, making targeted promises, and speaking foreign languages at events like the Khalsa Day event in Toronto on Sunday the 28th April , aiming to attract specific ethnic groups.\n\nThis commentary was provided by Maxime Bernier, underscoring his concern about current political trends.\n\nHe directly criticized Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP) and Trudeau's coalition partner, who also attended the contentious events in Toronto.\n\nBernier criticized Singh for his past reluctance to denounce the terrorists responsible for the 1985 Air India bombing, which resulted in the deaths of 329 people.\n\nHe pointed out Singh's connections with individuals sympathetic to the Khalistani cause, questioning his suitability as the leader of a major Canadian political party.

In a latest update, further widening the rift, Canada has now arrested three Indians for their alleged involvement in the Hardeep Singh Nijjar Murder. The names and photos of all three Indians who have been arrested, has been released by the Canadian Police and an 'active investigation' is underway.

Here's what the Foreign Minister said...\n\nAs mentioned earlier, S Jaishankar, India's Foreign Minister has reacted to Canada arresting three Indians in the Hardeep Singh Nijjar's Murder Case. The Foreign Minister said that he had seen news of the arrests and said the suspects \"apparently are Indians of some kind of gang background... we'll have to wait for the police to tell us.\"\n\nApart from his reaction to the arrests, the Foreign Minister has also raised a major concern with respect to organised crime in Canada; he believed that Canada has allowed organised crime to work in Canada, from India. In his words, \"But, as I said, one of our concerns which we have been telling them is that, you know, they have allowed organized crime from India, specifically from Punjab, to operate in Canada.\"\n\nSanjay Verma, India's high commissioner to Canada, said that it hopes to get regular updates from Canadian authorities regarding the three arrested Indians. \"I understand that the arrests have been made as a result of investigations conducted by the relevant Canadian law enforcement agencies.

Is the agency now doing similar operations in the West?\n\nMonths after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada accused India's government of plotting a murder on Canadian soil -- plunging diplomatic relations between the two countries to their lowest level ever -- the first arrests in the killing, which came on Friday, did little to demystify the basis of his claim.\n\nThe police didn't offer clues or present any evidence that India had orchestrated the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh nationalist leader who was gunned down at the temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia, in June. What they did say was that three Indian men had committed the killing and that an investigation into India's role was ongoing.\n\nBefore the arrests, Indian officials had maintained that Canada was trying to drag New Delhi into what it described as essentially a rivalry between gangs whose members were long wanted for crimes back in India.\n\nAfter the arrests, a report from the CBC, Canada's public broadcasting corporation, based on anonymous sources, also said the suspects belonged to an Indian criminal gang.\n\nBut analysts and former officials said that the possible role of a gang in the killing does not necessarily mean the Indian government was not involved in the crime.\n\nIndia's external spy agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, or RAW, has long been suspected of tapping into criminal networks to carry out operations in its immediate neighborhood in South Asia while maintaining deniability.\n\nCanada's accusation, if proven, that India orchestrated the Nijjar killing -- and a similar accusation made soon after by the United States in a different case -- may suggest that RAW is now extending its playbook of working with criminals to carry out operations in Western countries, analysts said.\n\nU.S. officials have produced strong evidence in their accusation that an agent of the Indian government participated in a foiled attempt to assassinate a dual American-Canadian citizen. And Canada and allied officials have maintained that Canada has evidence supporting Mr. Trudeau's claim that Indian agents carried out Mr. Nijjar's killing.\n\nBut the Canadian failure to reveal any evidence that India took part, nine months after Mr. Trudeau's explosive allegation, leaves the killing of Mr. Nijjar in the realm of accusations and counter-accusation in what is a highly tense political environment in both countries, analysts said.\n\nProud of His 'Star Wars' Legacy\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has been flexing his muscles as a nationalist strongman, pitching himself during his ongoing campaign for a third-term in office as a protector of India who would go as far as it takes to target security threats.\n\nDuring speeches, he has boasted about how his government eliminates enemies by \"descending in their homes.\" While he has made those references in relation to the country's archenemy -- Pakistan -- right wing accounts on social media had celebrated the slaying of Mr. Nijjar in Canada as a similar reach of Mr. Modi's long arm.\n\nMr. Trudeau, on the other hand, had been facing criticism of weakness in the face of Chinese election interference activities on Canadian soil, and his getting ahead of the Nijjar killing was seen as compensating for that.\n\nCanadian police announced on Friday that they had arrested the three Indian men in Edmonton, Alberta, the same day and charged them with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the killing of Mr. Nijjar. The suspects had been living in Canada for three to five years but were not permanent residents of Canada, the police said.\n\nThe gang that the CBC reported that the hit-men are connected to is led by Lawrence Bishnoi, 31, who is accused of several cases of murder, extortion and narcotics trafficking. He has orchestrated much of it from an Indian jail, where he has been held since 2014. His members are seen as being behind the murder of a popular Punjabi rapper, and threats of attacks on Bollywood celebrities.\n\nIndian security officials have frequently arrested criminals connected to Mr. Bishnoi, often with allegations that the gang's network stretched as far as Canada and overlapped with those promoting from Canadian soil the cause of Khalistan, a once deeply violent separatist movement with the goal of carving out the Indian state of Punjab as an independent nation.\n\nA large Sikh diaspora resides in Canada, many of them having migrated there after a violent and often indiscriminate crackdown by the Indian government in the 1980s against the movement for an independent Khalistan. While the cause has largely died down inside India, it continues to have supporters among some segments of the diaspora. The Indian government has accused Canada, and several other Western countries, of not doing enough to crack down on the separatists.\n\nAnalysts and former security officials said that in India's immediate geographic neighborhood, RAW has often been willing to venture into murky spaces to recruit killers. Senior officials of Mr. Modi's administration, including Ajit Doval, the storied former spymaster who now serves as his longtime national security adviser, have in the past been accused of reaching into the underworld to find hit men willing to go after targets both inside the country as well as abroad.\n\nMr. Bishnoi has demonstrated enormous power from behind bars, even giving a television interview from jail last year to pitch himself as a nationalist warrior rather than a criminal mastermind. That, one former security official said, was a signal of his trying to align himself with the spirit of nationalism for a potential deal.\n\n\"I am a nationalist,\" Mr. Bishnoi said in that interview. \"I am against Khalistan. I am against Pakistan.\"\n\nAjai Sahni, a security analyst who runs the South Asia Terrorism Portal in New Delhi, said the exploitation of criminal gangs by spy agencies to carry out operations with deniability was something that \"happens all over the world.\"\n\n\"It is definitely possible for agencies like RAW to use gang rivalries instead of exposing their own covert operators,\" Mr. Sahni added. \"But just because that is generally how one would expect it to be done, it doesn't necessarily mean we know this is exactly the case in Nijjar's killing.\"\n\nThe failed plot on American soil had some of the sloppy hallmarks of an agency trying to extend an old playbook into a different, unfamiliar space.\n\nA U.S. indictment in November laid out evidence, including electronic communication and cash transactions between the hired hit man -- who turned out to be an undercover cop -- a boastful middleman, and an Indian intelligence handler whom The Washington Post recently identified as Vikram Yadav.\n\nThe Indian government's response suggested worry: India's top diplomat said the action was not government policy, while the government announced an investigation into the matter and promised cooperation with the United States.\n\nCanada's case has played out very differently. The country has not publicly disclosed any evidence backing up Mr. Trudeau's clam, even as allied officials said in September that Canadian officials had found a \"smoking gun\": intercepted communications of Indian diplomats in Canada indicating involvement in the plot.\n\nIndian officials have pushed back against Mr. Trudeau's claims with the kind of aggression that suggested it either wasn't involved or that it was confident of its deniability.\n\nThe Indian government expelled Canadian diplomats, and doubled down by putting out a list of individuals on Canadian soil that it said were long wanted as part of what it described as a crime and terror nexus.\n\nLast week, officials in Mr. Modi's government jumped on scenes of an event that Mr. Trudeau had attended to say it showed his accusations were simply to appease what they say is a Sikh vote bank for him. They pointed to videos of an event where Mr. Trudeau was the chief guest and where chants of \"long live Khalistan\" were shouted. Mr. Trudeau, in his speech, said he will always be there \"to protect your rights and your freedoms, and we will always defend your community against hatred.\"\n\nAfter the speech, the Indian foreign ministry summoned Canada's second highest ranking diplomat in New Delhi to lodge a complaint.\n\n\"His remarks to us illustrates once again the kind of political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism and people who practice violence,\" Randhir Jaiswal, the foreign ministry spokesman, said at a news conference.\n\nMujib Mashal is the South Asia bureau chief for The Times, helping to lead coverage of India and the diverse region around it, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan.

It took on a militant form in the 1980s and 90s which engulfed the Punjab and parts of north India in a bloody conflict.\n\nIn 1984 the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards as revenge for the violence and desecration of the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine of the Sikhs.\n\nThough the movement finds little resonance in India, its campaign has survived in the

India has dismissed Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" \"Canada did not give any proof. They do not share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us. It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India. As election is coming in Canada, they indulge in vote bank politics,\" the external affairs minister said.\n\nHe said the Indian Prime Minister is regarded highly by many country heads.\n\n\"Recently, the prime minister of a Pacific country touched the feet of Modi while the Australian PM calls Modi as Boss.

Image: REUTERS\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is again up in political arms against India. While speaking at an event to celebrate the Khalsa Day, he witnessed and perhaps was happy to hear pro-Khalistan slogans. Trudeau remarked, \"Our job is not to crack down on political protest.\"\n\nOf course, it depends on what kind of protests he and his Western allies would crack down or bless. It also depends whether an event is just a political protest or part of an exercise to promote separatism, spread hatred and parade propaganda materials. If it were a protest in Canada that aims at creation of a separate state in India by people who generally vote for Trudeau's party, naturally he would refrain from cracking down and may, in fact, bless it with indirect support.\n\nThis statement of his may actually politically cost him, because all Sikh population in Canada are not votaries of separatism. But his main target is India and the Indian government, which is reflected in his statement on the sidelines of the event that he cannot ignore the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June last year that his government believes was engineered by the Indian government agents.\n\nThe Khalistanis in Canada are certainly aware that Trudeau cannot materially assist their demand, but they are taking advantage of his anti-Indianism. Trudeau also knows that a new state of Khalistan is not going to emerge in India, yet he is using it as a political toll with a belief that his party or coalition partners may get Sikh votes.\n\nWhat Trudeau is unable to realise is the fact that his political ambitions are threatening to severely disrupt friendly, cooperative and constructive ties between two resilient democracies -- India and Canada. The reaction of the Ministry of External Affairs to Trudeau's remarks amply amplifies this: \"PM Trudeau has made such remarks earlier as well. His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence.\"\n\nIn addition, arrest of three Indian nationals suspected of involvement in the Nijjar killing could have been an internal law and order operation by the Canadian government, but the way it was reported and the manner in which the Canadian Prime Minister used it to score a political point also indicates the anti-Indian sentiment and actions by him. Trudeau said that this arrest was important because \"Canada is a rule-of-law country\" and it is committed to \"protecting all its citizens.\" Trudeau repeatedly views a declared terrorist Nijjar as nothing but a Canadian citizen. Trudeau believes separatist speeches are freedom of expression and individuals, who are declared as terrorists by India, cannot be considered terrorists until his government says so.\n\nHad it not been for his anti-Indianism, the arrests of these nationals would not have been timed to be announced during national elections in India and a Prime Minister of the country would not be making a comment on an issue which is part of internal law and order proceedings. No wonder, Canadian police are yet to share the detailed information of the arrests with their Indian counterparts. This is not an example of cooperation between law enforcement agencies of the two countries; rather it showcases Trudeau's determination to score political brownie points for domestic political purposes!\n\nIn the meantime, the Trudeau government released an interim intelligence report alleging Indian interference in Canadian elections. The timing of the release of this report is also part of the political strategy of Prime Minister Trudeau. This report interestingly accuses Pakistan and China along with India of seeking to influence Canadian elections. It concludes by saying that China is the \"main perpetrator of foreign interference against Canada.\" It says that there was no indication of Indian-based disinformation campaigns in the 2021 Canadian general election! This is a headline-grabbing release of a report amidst rising political differences between Trudeau and Modi governments. It orchestrates Trudeau's series of perceived grievances and allegations against the Indian government.\n\nThe language of the report is also instructive. It says, \"A body of intelligence indicates that Indian proxy agents may have attempted to interfere in democratic processes... to secure the election of pro-India candidates or gaining influence over candidates who take office.\" That means there are no evidences and it is only a conjecture. The report may actually backfire, as it alleges that Canadian politicians may have received \"illicit financial support.\" It also says that in some cases the Canadian politicians \"might never know their campaigns received illicit funds\"! That means the intelligence report paints the Canadian politicians as vulnerable victims of external manipulations and, in fact, undermines their intelligence!\n\nPrime Minister Trudeau during his visit to India at the time of farmers' protest had not so secretly signalled his support to the protesting farmers and considered this \"non-interference\" in Indian domestic politics. And his government's interim intelligence report believes that India \"may have interfered\" in Canadian domestic politics through clandestine means!\n\nIt is to be seen how Prime Minister Trudeau will react to World Report 2024 issued by Human Rights Watch. It is a long report and it lists several challenges of human rights violation by the Canadian government that include \"wide ranging abuses against Indigenous peoples and immigration detainees, including people with disabilities....\"\n\nTrudeau has little compassion for exploited Indigenous people of Canada and others, but he is a champion of freedom of expression that may profess separatism in a friendly, democratic country. It is high time Prime Minister Trudeau rises above his personal political ambitions and stops the erosion of constructive ties between Canada and India. The current global challenges, including ongoing wars, potential flashpoints and conceivable rise in terrorism, will benefit from constructive cooperation between India and Canada.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaisakhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaisakhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_conflicts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Indian_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Indian sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020\u20132021_Indian_farmers'_protest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020\u20132021 Indian farmers' protest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Trudeau-AP-2-1-2024-05-1eaf364011ae521897b8ec9cd725a2a9-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

The Canadian government under Justin Trudeau, for the last one year, under pressure from Sikh radical groups and Khalistani pressure groups, has been claiming that Nijjar was killed by Indian intelligence operatives.\n\nApart from leading the Khalistan Tiger Force, which has been banned by Government of India and being a prominent member of another banned terrorist group, Sikhs For Justice, Nijjar was also the president of the Guru Nanak Sikh gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. After his death, videos and pictures showing him carrying automatic assault rifles and taking part in training exercises had emerged.\n\nSikh gurdwaras receive huge donations from various quarters, some of which is then given by the office bearers to local politicians to be on their good side. These office bearers too are given preferential treatment by local politicians because of the influence they hold over the Sikh voters.\n\nThese office bearers, apart from handling the affairs of the gurdwaras, carry out their own businesses which includes mediating over disputes between two parties.\n\nOn Friday night, the Canadian police announced the arrest of the 22-year-old Karan Brar, Kamal Preet Singh and 28-year-old Karan Preet Singh from Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nOttawa-based local sources told The Sunday Guardian that the three were a part of a hit-squad that has carried out similar murders in the last one year.\n\nThe three had entered Canada at different points since 2021 as \"international students\" and were involved in criminal activities since then.\n\nSources said that these three were also likely to be involved in a November 2023 shootout that took place in Edmonton in which a 41-year-old Harpreet Singh Uppal and his 11-year-old son were shot dead on 9 November. Uppal was a high ranking member of a criminal syndicate involved in a drug trade and had escaped a similar attack in October 2021 after he and his family members were fired at by unidentified gunmen while having dinner at a restaurant in Edmonton.\n\nOne day before, on 8 November, Parmvir Singh Chahil, a 27-year-old member of \"United Nations group\" formed in 1979, was shot dead in Toronto.\n\nOn 20 September, another Canada based gangster who had fled India in 2017, Sukhdool Singh Gill alias Sukha Duneke was shot dead in Winnipeg. He was a senior member of Davinder Bambiha gang and a close associate of Arshdeep Singh, better known as Arsh Dala, another member of the Bambiha gang. Bambiha, 25, was shot dead in a police encounter at Gill Kalan near Rampura, Bathinda in September 2016. However, his gang members continue to operate across Canada and the United States.\n\nThe Bambiha gang and a criminal syndicate led by another gangster, Lawrence Bishnoi, who has been in the custody of Indian authorities since 2014, have been killing each member for supremacy and revenge.\n\nMembers of both these gangs have tied up with local gangs in the respective countries to pool their resources and the Punjabi youth, who are migrating to Canada in large numbers, are considered by them as an easy pool to pick and recruit them as lower level operators for which they are assured money, drugs and access to sex workers.\n\nWhile the Canadian police have not yet confirmed whether these four killings -- that of Nijjar, Uppal, Gill and Chahil -- were carried out by the same group members that were arrested on Friday, sources said that all them were linked and happened because of turf war and/or retribution.\n\nEmails sent to Canadian officials seeking a response on whether they have been able to uncover the links between these four murders did not elicit a response till the time this report went to press.\n\nIn 2023, Edmonton had recorded 200-plus shooting incidents, most of them targeted shooting, a rise of more than 50% over 2022.\n\nCanada has a long history of experiencing gang wars, which is attributed to the political patronage that these gangs receive from local officials and politicians. In the 1990s, all major Canadian cities were reeling under mob violence, with \"Hells Angels\" and \"Blood Family Mafia\" who were majorly into drug trafficking, becoming household names.\n\nNow, they have been replaced with local Canadian gangs who are actively working with their Indian counterparts while expanding their operations to other countries.\n\n(Agencies)\n\nComments", "source": {"uri":

During the event, Indian leaders such as PM Modi, EAM S Jaishankar and the Defence Minister were threatened publically.\n\nA week after anti-India activities were reported at an event where Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was present, thus fuelling fresh tensions between the two nations, a similar incident was reported again on Sunday. Although, this time, Trudeau was not present during a march organised to mark \"Khalsa Day\" on Sunday, media reports claimed that the Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre attended the event. Poilievre also shared a post on social media X, where he could be seen with Sikh families and policemen of Indian origin.\n\nSeveral media reported pro-Khalistan flags were raised, with banners of conducting Khalistan referendum. Besides, threats against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh were also raised by radicals.\n\nNotably, this was not the first time when such an event was organised where Indian leaders and officials were threatened publically. In fact, this has become a routine exercise in Canada, where political leaders attend such events in order to boost their political presence among people of Indian origin.\n\nAccording to Canadian government data, Sikhism in Canada has nearly 8,00,000 adherents who account for 2.1% of the country's population as of 2021, forming the country's fastest-growing and fourth-largest religious group. The largest Sikh populations in Canada are found in Ontario, followed by British Columbia and Alberta. Canadian political leaders often attend religious events where radical groups advocate for a separate country for Khalistan.\n\nIt is worth mentioning the latest development came in the middle of the India-Canada tensions which were fuelled by Trudeau's allegations against India. Last year, Trudeau alleged that the Indian government was involved in the killing of a Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Vancouver. However, he did not profess any concrete evidence to substantiate his claims. Since then, the relations between the two nations nosedived.\n\nRecently, India's foreign ministry summoned a Canadian diplomat to New Delhi and raised grave concerns over the space given to the extremist groups in Ottawa.\n\nLater on Saturday, Jaishankar reacted to the arrests made against the killing of Nijjar where he underscored what is happening in poll-bound Canada over the killing of Khalistan separatists is mostly due to their internal politics and has nothing to do with India. Jaishankar said this while replying to a question on why Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is criticizing India.\n\nHe said a section of pro-Khalistan people are using Canada's democracy, creating a lobby and have become a vote bank. The ruling party in Canada has no majority in Parliament and some parties depend on pro-Khalistan leaders, he said. \"We have convinced them several times not to give visa, legitimacy or political space to such people which is causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship,\" Jaishankar said. But the Canadian government has not done anything, Jaishankar said, adding that India sought the extradition of 25 people, most of whom are pro-Khalistan, but they did not pay any heed.\n\n(With inputs from agency)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ajit_kumar@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Ajit Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaisakhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaisakhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S.

Trudeau had spoken in the backdrop of three Indian nationals arrested in Canada earlier this week and charged with the murder of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\n\nNijjar, a Canadian citizen, was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18, 2023.\n\nJaishankar, during an interaction on his book 'Why Bharat Matters' here, questioned Justin Trudeau-led dispensation for giving space and legitimacy to \"extremism, separatism, and advocates of violence\" in the name of free speech.\n\nThe EAM said some people in Canada, with 'pro-Pakistan leanings', have organised themselves politically and taken the shape of an influential political lobby.\n\nOn the rise of pro-Khalistani activities in Canada and the arrest of three Indians over their alleged involvement in the killing of Nijjar, Jaishankar said, \"In some countries, these kinds of people have organised themselves politically and become a political lobby and in some of these democratic countries, the politicians of these countries are made to believe that if they defer to these people or pander to these people, these people have some ability to get a community to support them. So, they have tried to create space for themselves in the politics of these countries. I mean, at this time, it's not so much a problem in the US.\n\n\"Our biggest problem right now is in Canada. Because in Canada, actually, today the party in power in Canada, and other parties in Canada have given these kinds of extremism, separatism, and advocates of violence a certain legitimacy in the name of free speech. See, when you tell them something, their answer is no, no we are a democratic country, but it is free speech. The point that they need to understand, it is no longer a world that runs as a one-way street. If there are that which happen out there, there will be pushback. Newton's law of politics will apply there also. There will be a reaction. Others will take steps or counter it,\" he added.\n\nHe said he saw reports that three people have been arrested, and, the Canadian police have conducted 'some investigation'. Jaishankar said Canada has been welcoming people from India with links to organised crime, ignoring warnings by New Delhi. \"Often, when I see for example these kinds of attacks, threats to our embassies, because they concern me very deeply, and I tell the foreign minister, suppose if (they) happened to you, if it was your embassy, your diplomat, your flag, how would you react. We have to keep our position strong on this particular report which has come. I also saw it last night, I was coming to Odisha in the morning, somebody may have been arrested, their police may have done some investigation,\" Jaishankar said at the event.\n\n\"But, the fact is that a number of gangland people, a number of people with organised crime links from Punjab have been made welcome in Canada. We have been telling Canada, 'look these are wanted criminals from India, you have given them visas. Many of them have come in false documentation, and yet you allow them to live there.

And these efforts include investigating connections with the Government of India.\"", "source": {"uri": "nationalpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guru Nanak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs_for_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs for Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/nationalpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Hardeep-Nijjar-1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 228, "textEnd": 235}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Find out how you can still connect with us.\n\nThe arrests of three suspected hitmen accused of killing a B.C. Sikh leader highlight an emerging security problem: foreign intelligence services are contracting their dirty work to the criminal underworld.\n\nGovernments are increasingly accused of trying to silence and kill opponents outside their borders, and they are relying more and more on crime groups to do so, officials and experts told Global News.\n\n\"Some states leverage criminal organizations to advance their objectives,\" said Eric Balsam, a Canadian Security Intelligence Service spokesperson.\n\n\"The use of criminal elements can permit plausible deniability and generate resources to advance threat activities.\"\n\nIran's intelligence service was recently accused of hiring Canadian Hell's Angels to kill dissidents in the United States. Indian intelligence, meanwhile, allegedly employed a drug trafficker to kill a U.S. Sikh activist.\n\nIn the latest alleged case, announced by the RCMP on Friday, three Indian nationals arrested in Edmonton were accused of gunning down Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, B.C. on June 18, 2023.\n\nKaranpreet Singh, 28, Kamalpreet Singh, 22, and Karan Brar, 22, have been charged with murder and conspiracy in Nijjar's killing, according to charges filed in B.C. court.\n\nA source familiar with the matter told Global News the killing was a murder-for-hire and was believed to be tied to India's Bishnoi crime group, which has been implicated in drugs, extortion and killings.\n\nIt's leader, Lawrence Bishnoi, has been imprisoned in India since 2014 but continues to operate from behind bars, said Shinder Purewal, a political science professor at Kwantlen Polytechnic University.\n\n\"Many people probably haven't heard this name, but in India he's like an idol,\" Purewal said.\n\nWilling to do anything for money, Bishnoi has an estimated 700 gunmen, including in Canada, where the gang is \"very active,\" he said.\n\nThe World Sikh Organization said Bishnoi had recently appeared in the Indian press \"declaring himself an Indian nationalist.\"\n\nHe has also vowed to oppose Khalistan, the independent home in India's Punjab state sought by some Sikh activists including Nijjar, the group said in a statement.\n\nThe Bishnoi gang had been implicated in extortion in six Canadian cities, according to the statement, which said the arrests \"raise disturbing questions about the nexus between the government of India and criminal gangs.\"\n\nThe alleged hitmen entered Canada over the past five years and were suspected of involvement in the world of drug trafficking and violence, according to the source, who spoke on condition of not being named.\n\nAt a news conference, the RCMP said the arrests were the initial results of a series of investigations that are still underway and were examining the suspected involvement of the Indian government.\n\nIndia had long branded Nijjar a terrorist and asked for his arrest, accusing him of leading the Khalistan Tiger Force armed group. Nijjar denied it and the source said no credible evidence was ever provided.\n\nCanadian investigators believe the slaying may have been an escalation of the Indian government's campaign against Sikh separatists like Nijjar, and that its Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) foreign intelligence agency was behind it.\n\nIndia has denied involvement.\n\nContracting out jobs to hired guns allows foreign governments to insulate themselves from their lawbreaking and attribute it instead to everyday crime, according to security experts.\n\n\"There's a layer of plausible deniability,\" said Colin P. Clarke, director of policy and research at The Soufan Group, a U.S.-based intelligence and security consulting group.\n\nBut the strategy also has drawbacks. Reckless and unscrupulous by nature, members of crime groups may prove careless and inept, allowing police to link them back to a foreign regime.\n\n\"They're not going to operate with the same finesse an intelligence service would have,\" said Clarke, who co-authored a paper last October on India and the Nijjar killing.\n\nFollowing Nijjar's murder, the U.S. announced it had disrupted a similar plot to kill one of his associates, Gurpatwant Pannun, the New York-based lawyer for the group Sikhs for Justice.\n\nAccording to a U.S. indictment in the case, an Indian intelligence official hired an alleged drug trafficker, Nikhil Gupta, for the job, offering money and the dismissal of charges he faced.\n\nBut the FBI infiltrated the plot, and Gupta was arrested in the Czech Republic on June 30. In exchanges intercepted by the FBI, Gupta and his co-conspirators also discussed Nijjar.\n\nBy allegedly having others do its work, India's RAW intelligence service put itself at risk of being exposed by informants and undercover operators, said Dan Stanton.\n\n\"RAW is basically having to engage with people they wouldn't normally engage,\" the former Canadian Security Intelligence Service official said. \"They needed to reach out to some unsavory characters.\"\n\nStanton said RAW was not known as a particularly skilled intelligence agency. \"From what I've seen ... operational security isn't something they're very good at. You need to make sure these things are secure and discreet. And that's where they're not that great.\"\n\n\"We're seeing this with the Iranians as well. They're hiring people connected to organized crime, private investigators -- even the Russians, to a certain extent.\"\n\nIran's Ministry of Intelligence and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has used gangs to target regime opponents in Europe and North America, including dissidents, activists and journalists.\n\n\"The regime increasingly relies on organized criminal groups in furtherance of these plots in an attempt to obscure links to the government of Iran and maintain plausible deniability,\" the U.S. Treasury alleged in January.\n\nWorking at the direction of Iran, the so-called Zindashti Network allegedly recruited a Canadian outlaw biker gang member, Damion Patrick John Ryan, to kill two dissidents in Maryland.\n\nAn Iran-based associate of the network gave Ryan the location and photos of the pair, and coordinated the US$350,000 payment, according to the U.S. allegations.\n\nRyan allegedly recruited another Canadian Hell's Angels affiliate, Adam Richard Pearson, to carry out the murders. Both Ryan and Pearson were arrested for unrelated crimes before the killing occurred.\n\nThe head of the network, Iranian drug trafficker Naji Ibrahim Sharifi-Zindashti, operates at the behest of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and has targeted other dissidents, according to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nIn 2020, Zindashti members abducted a leader of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz, Habib Chaab, and smuggled him to Iran where he was tortured. The MOIS sponsored the operation, the U.S. said.\n\nThe Zindashti network was also involved in the assassinations in Istanbul of regime critics Mas'ud Vardanjani in 2019 and British-Iranian Saeed Karimian, who owned GEM TV, in 2017.\n\nIntelligence summaries tabled at Canada's foreign interference commission alleged that Indian officials have increasingly relied on \"proxies\" in Canada to conduct activities.\n\nThe tactic \"obfuscates any explicit link\" between the Indian government and its foreign interference activities, according to the intelligence summaries.\n\n\"Proxies liaise and work with Indian intelligence officials in India and Canada, taking both explicit and implicit direction from them.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global

His remarks illustrate once again the political space that has been given in Canada to separatism, extremism, and violence,\" external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in News Delhi at his weekly media at a briefing.\n\n\"This not only impacts India-Canada relations but also encourages a climate of violence and criminality in Canada to the detriment of its own citizens,\" he added, when asked about Trudeau's remarks.\n\nIndia on Monday also summoned the Canadian deputy high commissioner and lodged a strong protest with him over the raising of 'pro-Khalistan' slogans at the event in the presence of Trudeau.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guru Nanak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaisakhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaisakhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CTV News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109829569,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-22650,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

India also stopped issuing visas to Canadian nationals, but later resumed them in a phased manner.\n\nAlso Read:", "source": {"uri": "outlookindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.outlookindia.com/"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaisakhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaisakhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Area_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Area Studies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/outlookindia/import/uploadimage/library/16_9/16_9_5/IMAGE_1687668334.webp?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Canada is an exception. You see the different country heads are praising Bharat and its Prime Minister.\"\n\nTrudeau's country thinks there wouldn't be any reaction to its antics of fostering criminals, Jaishankar said.\n\n\"In some countries, these kinds of people have organised themselves politically and become a political lobby and in some of these democratic countries, the politicians of these countries are made to believe that if they defer to these people or pander to these people, these people have some ability to get a community to support them. So, they have tried to create space for themselves in the politics of these countries. I mean, at this time, it's not so much a problem in the US,\" ANI quoted Jaishankar as saying.\n\nThe External Affairs Minister said India's biggest problem right now is in Canada.\n\n\"Our biggest problem right now is in Canada. Because in Canada, actually, today the party in power in Canada, and other parties in Canada have given these kinds of extremism, separatism, and advocates of violence a certain legitimacy in the name of free speech. See, when you tell them something, their answer is no no we are a democratic country but it is free speech,\" Jaishankar added.\n\n\"The point that they need to understand, it is no longer a world that runs as a one-way street. If there are that which happen out there, there will be pushback. Newton's law of politics will apply there also. There will be a reaction. Others will take steps or counter it\" the Indian foreign minister said.\n\nSlamming the Canadian government for welcoming people from India with links to organised crime, despite warnings by New Delhi, the Minister of External Affairs said,\" The fact is that a number of gangland people, a number of people with organised crime links from Punjab have been made welcome in Canada. We have been telling Canada saying look these are wanted criminals from India, you have given them visas.\"\n\nThe minister stressed that many of these people with organised crime links go to Canada on false documentation, and they are allowed to live there.\n\n\"If you decide to import for political purposes people with very dubious, actually, very negative backgrounds, there will be issues, they have in some cases created problems in their own country as a result of their own policies. No, why would we fear, if something happens there, it is for them to worry about\" the minister added.\n\nIt is important to note that both countries are dealing with an unprecedented diplomatic crisis after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Indian agents of killing pro-Khalistan Canadian leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023. However, the Indian government has dismissed the accusations as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\"", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaishankar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaishankar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhubaneswar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bhubaneswar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian News International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/05/05/600x338/S_Jaishankar_1714905823213_1714905823370.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Subrahmanyam Jaishankar also accused Canada of welcoming criminals when asked about his reaction to developments in the case of a homicide that has roiled tensions between the two countries. RCMP charged three Indian nationals last Friday in the death of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was shot dead last June as he left a temple in Surrey, B.C. His death sparked a wave of protests and rallies against Indian diplomats in Canada, particularly after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused New Delhi of playing a role in the homicide. Jaishankar says the protests in Canada have gone beyond the limits of free speech, and he reacted to last week's arrest by repeating claims that Ottawa allows Indian criminals to immigrate to Canada. He also accused Canadian politicians of various stripes of giving electoral clout to people wanting to carve out a Sikh homeland separate from India, called Khalistan. Jaishankar made the comments Saturday at an event in the eastern city of Bhubaneswar at a forum of intellectuals. One attendee asked Jaishankar about countries like the U.S. and Canada wanting to partner with India while allowing people to support a separatist movement there, which New Delhi deems to be unconstitutional. Another attendee inquired about last Friday's arrests, and Jaishankar addressed both questions. \"It's not so much a problem in the U.S.; our biggest problem right now is in Canada,\" Jaishankar said, adding the governing Liberals as well as other parties \"have given these kinds of extremism, separatism, advocates of violence a certain legitimacy, in the name of free speech.\" Jaishankar said he has asked Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly about \"attacks or threats\" to India's diplomatic missions and staff in Canada. \"I tell the foreign minister (Joly) saying, 'Suppose it happened to you. if it was your diplomat, your embassy, your flag, how would you react?' So, we have to keep our position strong,\" he said. Jaishankar reiterated his ministry's insistence that Ottawa is allowing criminal elements to operate in Canada and affiliate with Sikh separatists. \"Somebody may have been arrested; the police may have done some investigation. But the fact is (a) number of gangland people, (a) number of people with organized crime links from Punjab, have been made welcome in Canada,\" he said. \"These are wanted criminals from India, you have given them visas ... and yet you allow them to live there.\" New Delhi raised that same concern a week before Trudeau announced that India was suspected of involvement in Nijjar's death last September. In its readout of Trudeau's meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Jaishankar's ministry had called out \"the nexus of (Khalistan separatism) forces with organized crime, drug syndicates and human trafficking.\" But Ottawa has repeatedly insisted India has not proven that people it accuses of terrorism have actually done anything that meets the threshold under Canada's criminal code. In February, a senior Canadian foreign-service bureaucrat told MPs that Canadian officials have been offering their Indian counterparts \"workshops\" on the rule of law, because India's definition of terrorism \"does not always compute in our legal system.\" In his remarks Saturday, Jaishankar also said \"there will be pushback\" to calls for Khalistan separation, but he didn't specify where that may come from. \"It's no longer a world which runs as a one-way street,\" he said. \"There will be a reaction; others will take steps or counter it.\" India's high commission in Ottawa did not immediately respond when asked whether Jaishankar referred to pushback from India or by non-state elements.

File Image\n\nCanadian authorities have apprehended individuals believed to be part of a suspected hit team, assigned to assassinate prominent Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, British Columbia, last June, as per information obtained by CBC News.\n\nThe crime has fractured the diplomatic relationship between India and Canada after the latter accused New Delhi of involvement in the killing.\n\nAdditionally, sources closely involved in the probe informed CBC that law enforcement is actively exploring potential connections to three other homicides in Canada, including the fatal shooting of an 11-year-old boy in Edmonton.\n\nThe alleged hit squad members are purported to have assumed various roles such as shooters, drivers, and spotters on the day Nijjar was slain at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, according to insider accounts.\n\nThe sources disclosed that investigators had identified the alleged hit squad members in Canada several months ago and have been conducting intensive surveillance on them since.\n\nAccording to documents submitted in a Surrey court on Friday, Kamalpreet Singh, Karanpreet Singh, and Karan Brar are facing charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy in connection with the Nijjar case. All three individuals appeared before a judge virtually on Friday.\n\nWhat do we know about the three arrested individuals?\n\nThe three alleged hitmen in their 20s, all Indian nationals, arrived in Canada several years ago, reported CBC.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) identified the men arrested on Friday by their legal names, acknowledging they may also use shorter names or aliases:\n\nThe individuals in question are Indian citizens who had been residing in Edmonton. According to sources briefed by CBC, investigators had located these three individuals in Canada several months ago and had been closely monitoring them.\n\nReportedly, the men entered Canada on temporary visas, with some holding student visas. However, it is indicated that none of them engaged in educational pursuits during their time in Canada, nor did any obtain permanent residency status.\n\nThe RCMP stated that these men arrived in the country separately over a span of three to five years. However, during a news conference on Friday, they declined to provide further details regarding the immigration statuses of the suspects.\n\nSources indicate that members of the alleged hit squad assumed various roles such as shooters, drivers, and spotters on the day Nijjar was killed.\n\nEach of the three individuals is facing charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. According to court documents, police assert that the men collaborated with others to devise plans to kill Nijjar in Surrey and Edmonton between 1 May, 2023, and 18 June, 2023.\n\nAre the men related to the Bishnoi Gang?\n\nSources close to the investigation have said that all the men arrested on Friday are purported associates of a criminal organisation, reportedly linked to the infamous Punjabi gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who is presently incarcerated in India.\n\nBishnoi has been accused of various crimes, including the shooting death of Punjabi singer-politician Sidhu Moose Wala , a former resident of Brampton, Ontario, in Punjab in May 2022. Additionally, Bishnoi faces charges related to drug trafficking and extortion.\n\nAlso Read: Gangs of Canada: How the western country has become a haven for Punjabi gangsters\n\nAccording to media reports, Lawrence Bishnoi, along with another incarcerated Indian gangster, claimed responsibility on social media for Sukhdool Singh Gill's killing last September. They described it as retaliation for a prior gang-related murder in India.\n\nGill was one of Punjab's most wanted men, facing allegations of extortion and facilitating financial transactions to procure weapons for gang members. Indian law enforcement has openly associated him with multiple murders and other grave offences.\n\nIndia has persistently alleged that Punjabi gangsters utilise Canada as a hub to extort funds from business owners and other individuals in India. They reportedly rely on a network of underpaid gunmen to serve as collectors and enforcers back in India.\n\nWho is Lawrence Bishnoi?\n\nBorn in 1993 in Punjab, Lawrence Bishnoi spent his formative years in Abohar until 2010 before relocating to Chandigarh to enroll at DAV College. By 2011, he had become a part of the Panjab University Campus Students Council, where he crossed paths with gangster Goldy Brar. Together, Bishnoi and Brar delved into university politics and began engaging in criminal activities within the campus.\n\nWith over two dozen criminal cases on his record, including charges of murder and extortion, Bishnoi vehemently denies all accusations against him. His gang boasts affiliation with more than 700 shooters nationwide.\n\nAccording to a report by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), Bishnoi and his associate, Goldy Brar , are linked to Pro-Khalistan organisations.\n\nJail authorities report that Bishnoi utilises voice-over IP calls to communicate with his associates outside the prison.\n\nDo Bishnoi's criminal activities cross borders?\n\nAs of 2022, Bishnoi's criminal activities extended across five countries: India, Canada, Dubai, Austria, and Mexico, a report in India Today said. Within India, Bishnoi's gang maintains operations in seven states: Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Chandigarh, Delhi, Maharashtra, and Himachal Pradesh.\n\nThe gang's operations are entirely digital, with approximately 1000 individuals involved, including sharpshooters, criminals, and suppliers. Target selection occurs via audio conferences conducted from virtual numbers.\n\nVirtual phone numbers, which are not tied to a specific location and can be used on any phone without requiring a SIM card or physical address, facilitate these communications using internet technology.\n\nAlso Read: How Canada's charge of India's role in Nijjar killing has fallen flat\n\nLawrence Bishnoi serves as the mastermind of the criminal organisation, with Goldy Brar acting as its backbone. Sachin Bishnoi, Lawrence's cousin, oversees recruitment and target planning, while Anmol from Austria and Vikram Brar from Canada manage the gang's financial transactions.\n\nIn the hierarchy, Lawrence determines the targets and issues initial directives to Sampat Nehra. Subsequently, his brothers and associates abroad make threatening calls to the targets. Sources indicate that Lawrence typically does not directly communicate with the shooters but delegates this task to other intermediaries.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news",

In the thick of it all is Prajwal Revanna, grandson of former PM HD Deve Gowda, and sitting MP from Hassan, who is said to be involved in close to 3,000 video clips, photos and documents of alleged sexual assault and abuse against women.\n\nPrajwal Revanna sexual assault case | The complete coverage\n\nThe State government on April 27 announced a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the alleged sex scandal. A pen drive with thousands of sex videos featuring multiple women, allegedly recorded by the politician himself, had been doing the rounds ahead of elections in the constituency.\n\nWith pressure building on an embarrassed JD(S), the party suspended Mr. Prajwal on April 30. On May 1, the Hassan MP -- who had fled to Germany on April 27 morning -- was served a notice by the SIT to appear for questioning within 24 hours. He is said to have sought seven days' time to do so, through his lawyers.\n\nThe Gowda Family Tree\n\nOn May 3, Prajwal's father and JD(S) leader H. D. Revanna was booked for kidnapping one of the alleged victims sexually assaulted by his son. The alleged victim had worked as a maid in the Revanna household for six years. A video of her being 'raped' by Prajwal is in circulation, police sources said.\n\nPrajwal Revanna | Rise and fall\n\nHis father H.D. Revanna, a former Minister and elder brother of Mr. Kumaraswamy, has run the party affairs in Hassan with an iron grip. Prajwal and his elder brother Sooraj Revanna, an MLC, have been part of the electioneering process of their father as well as their mother Bhavani Revanna, a former member of Hassan Zilla Panchayat. He was a toddler when his grandfather became the PM and his father became a Cabinet Minister, and a teenager when his uncle became the Chief Minister of Karnataka in 2006.\n\n(2) 123 of 1,352 candidates in Phase 3 of Lok Sabha polls are women, 18% have criminal cases\n\nOnly 9% of the 1,352 candidates contesting in the third phase of the Lok Sabha elections are women while 18% have declared criminal cases against themselves, the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) said in a new report.\n\nAmong the 244 candidates with criminal records, five face charges related to murder while 24 have been booked in cases of attempted murder. The prevalence of criminal cases varies significantly across major political parties, with figures highlighting concerning trends among candidates from prominent parties such as the the BJP, Congress and the Samajwadi Party.\n\nThe report also highlighted the disparity in the candidates' financial backgrounds, disclosing that 29% or 392 candidates are \"crorepatis\", with the average assets per candidate standing at a substantial \u20b95.66 crore.\n\nThe report also highlights gender disparity in candidate selection with only 9% or 123 women contesting the elections in the third phase.\n\n(3) Hardeep Singh Nijjar killing: Three Indians arrested in Canada\n\nCanadian Police on May 3 said they have arrested three Indians they suspect were part of the alleged hit squad that had killed Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, 45, outside a gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18, 2023.\n\nKaran Brar, 22, Kamalpreet Singh, 22, and Karanpreet Singh, 28, all Indian nationals, residing in Edmonton have been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nNijjar was a Khalistani separatist and he was wanted in India on various terror charges.\n\nThe police said that none of the suspects were known to them earlier and they were investigating their possible ties to the Indian government.\n\nWill R&AW's overseas operations affect ties? | Explained\n\nCanada is a \"rule-of-law country\" with a strong and independent justice system and a fundamental commitment to protect its citizens, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said, a day after three Indian nationals were arrested.\n\nThe ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Mr. Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of 45-year-old Nijjar, a Khalistan separatist.\n\nIndia has dismissed Mr. Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated India, which had designated Nijjar a \"terrorist.\"\n\nIndia awaiting details about the arrest of three Indians in Canada in Nijjar murder case, says Jaishankar\n\nAfter three Indian nationals were arrested in connection with the murder, Police in Canada said they had worked with US law enforcement agencies, without giving additional details. The police suggested more arrests might be coming.\n\n(4) India's April manufacturing PMI at 58.8\n\nHSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for April was recorded at 58.8, a slight dip from last month's 59.1. A reading of over 50 signifies an expansion in economic activity levels and reading below 50 signifies shrinking activity. However, it was still the second-best improvement in operating conditions in three-and-a-half years.\n\nThe PMI headline figure is made of new orders, output, employment, Suppliers' Delivery Times, and Stocks of Purchases. New orders registered growth at the second-strongest pace in almost 40 months. Rising domestic demand aided this growth.\n\nEmployment from firms, even though moderate, was the quickest since September 2023. Stocks improved to a 19-year high due to anticipation of demand. Indian goods producers forecast a higher output growth for the year ahead, the survey said.\n\n(5) India's T20 World Cup squad\n\nYuzvendra Chahal and Shivam Dube were named in India's 15-member squad for the upcoming ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024. The team, announced by BCCI on Tuesday, will be led by Rohit Sharma. Hardik Pandya serves as the vice-captain.\n\nICC Twenty20 World Cup 2024: full schedule, dates and venues\n\nLeggie Chahal, ignored for India's recent T20 assignments, was picked on the strength of good returns for Rajasthan Royals in the ongoing IPL season. Chahal is the only right-arm spinner in the squad, with southpaws Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav forming the rest of the spin attack. Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj are the specialist pacers.\n\nThe tournament marks the international comeback of wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant. Pant, who last donned the India cap in December 2022, was forced into a long layoff after suffering a car accident. The 26-year-old has proved his worth in IPL 2024, making vital contributions with the bat for Delhi Capitals (DC) and showing athleticism with the 'keeping gloves. RR captain and fan-favourite Sanju Samson is the second gloveman. Samson has shone bright for RR, batting at a strike-rate of 161.08 with an average of 77.\n\nT20 World Cup 2024: India to face Pakistan on June 9 in New York\n\nLucknow Super Giants skipper K.L. Rahul and Royal Challengers Bengaluru's Dinesh Karthik were among the notable omissions. Karthik had harboured hopes of making the bus, after finding good form as a finisher for RCB. Shubman Gill lost out on the opener slot to Yashasvi Jaiswal. Gill and lower-order batter Rinku Singh were named in the reserves. Rinku gave way to Dube, who has shown a penchant for big hits.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwal_Revanna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prajwal Revanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Deve_Gowda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "H.

While interacting with senior journalists during a visit here, he also said the country needs a strong and active Prime Minister like Narendra Modi in order to bring further reforms in various sectors to make a \"Viksit Bharat (developed India)\". 'Indian Experience Testament to Transformative Power of Democracy', Says EAM S Jaishankar (Watch Video).\n\n\"India's image globally is now actually much much higher than it had been ever... Canada is an exception. You see the different country heads are praising Bharat and its Prime Minister,\" the external affairs minister said. He said a section of pro-Khalistan people are using Canada's democracy, creating a lobby and have become a vote bank.\n\nThe ruling party in Canada has no majority in Parliament and some parties depend on pro-Khalistan leaders, he said. \"We have convinced them several times not to give visa, legitimacy or political space to such people which is causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship,\" Jaishankar said. India Will 100% Have Political Stability for Next Decade or Even Two, Says EAM S Jaishankar (Watch Video).\n\nBut the Canadian government has not done anything, Jaishankar said, adding that India sought the extradition of 25 people, most of whom are pro-Khalistan, but they did not pay any heed. The ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar. India has dismissed Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\"\n\n\"Canada did not give any proof. They do not share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us. It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India. As election is coming in Canada, they indulge in vote bank politics,\" the external affairs minister said. He said the Indian Prime Minister is regarded highly by many country heads. \"Recently, the prime minister of a Pacific country touched the feet of Modi while the Australian PM calls Modi as Boss. Even (US) President Biden wanted to know the secret of Modi's popularity,\" Jaishankar said.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S.

The commissioner overseeing an inquiry into foreign attempts to meddle in Canada's last two elections released an interim report that found those attempts undermined the rights of Canadian voters because they \"tainted the process\" and eroded public trust, even though they did not change the overall results.\n\nCommissioner Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue stressed Ottawa needs to \"work hard\" to restore that trust by both informing Canadians of the threat of foreign interference and taking \"real and concrete steps\" to detect and deter it.\n\nHours after that report was released, RCMP announced it had arrested three Indian nationals charged with murder and conspiracy in the 2023 killing of B.C. Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar, whom India had declared was a \"terrorist.\" The federal government has said there are \"credible allegations of a potential link\" between Nijjar's death and agents of the Indian government.\n\nGlobal News reported Nijjar was warned by Canadian Security and Intelligence Service officers that \"professional assassins\" were after him, and that India had tried to get the RCMP to arrest Nijjar on allegations that were deemed to be not credible.\n\nAsked if he was still confident in Canada's security and intelligence services after they failed to prevent Nijjar's death, and in the wake of Hogue's interim report, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said he was. He also defended the actions the government has taken so far to strengthen those agencies' ability to combat foreign threats.\n\n\"We think we have put in place a series of measures that have been effective,\" he told Mercedes Stephenson in an interview that aired Sunday on The West Block. \"Can they be strengthened? Can they evolve based on the recommendations of the Hogue report? Of course they can.\"\n\nLeBlanc pushed back on suggestions that Hogue had accused the Liberals of not doing enough on the issue, but said the government will in fact be taking further action.\n\n\"I put on notice in the House of Commons on Friday our intention to introduce legislation very soon that will strengthen our ability to detect and disrupt foreign interference,\" he said. \"So in terms of your question about strengthening legislative measures, I hope in the coming days I'll be able to talk once it's introduced in Parliament about the details of this legislation.\"\n\nLeBlanc did not say if the legislation will include establishing a foreign agents registry, a move first announced more than a year ago but has been delayed by further consultations.\n\nThe minister said he has not spoken to his Indian counterpart about the Nijjar homicide investigation before or after Friday's arrests. He said the foreign affairs ministry is in regular contact with the Indian government.\n\n\"I don't know what I would say to (my counterpart) about an ongoing police investigation or a criminal proceeding,\" he said.\n\nHe did say he understands the concerns in Canada's Indian diaspora and other diaspora communities, including in the Jewish and Muslim communities, about increased threats to their safety posed by their home governments and other threat actors. He said the government is working with communities to ensure they feel safe.\n\nYet he rejected suggestions that Canada is seen by those actors as a place of impunity to conduct election interference and assassinations, or that Canada is weaker on the issue than the U.S., where authorities thwarted an attempted assassination plot also linked to the Indian government.\n\n\"I would think if you saw the arrests made Friday ... it's the exact opposite of impunity,\" he said. \"The RCMP are very much at work and doing very good work in this regard.\n\n\"I think that what we saw is a first step in holding to account those that allegedly murdered a Canadian citizen. And that work continues.\"\n\nThe public accusations against India for its alleged role in the killing of Nijjar have threatened a potential strategic alliance for Canada, which is seeking a broader Indo-Pacific strategy to counter China.\n\nDan Stanton, a former operations manager at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, told Stephenson in a separate interview that aired on The West Block that Canada, unlike the U.S., is stuck in the \"critical conundrum\" of trying to hold India accountable while also pursuing a diplomatic and economic partnership.\n\n\"The Americans have basically moved on,\" he said. \"They recognize the importance of the relationship with India (while) still holding them to account, like Saudi Arabia moving forward.\n\n\"Canada, as a middle power, we really don't have much leverage.\"\n\nWhile some form of justice may be served to Nijjar's family by prosecuting the alleged killers, Stanton added, it will be far more difficult for Canada to get India to acknowledge its potential involvement.\n\n\"I don't have a lot of hope for that,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

In recent speeches, Mr. Modi has taken credible accusations from Western officials that his government sent agents abroad to kill Canadians and other foreigners, the most overt form of foreign interference , and transformed them into taunts.\n\nToday, even India's enemies know: this is Modi, this is the New India, he declared at a rally on April 5: according to the Washington Post. This New India is entering your home to kill you.\n\nThis threat, targeting Muslim and Sikh foreigners whom his party considers enemies, was repeated on Tuesday. as reported by Indias NDTV: Regarding foreigners eyeing our borders with malicious intent, he boasted at an event, India no longer sends [documents]he kills enemies in their homes.\n\nTwo incidents this week made it clear that this language is intended, at least in part, to taunt Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who last year accused the Indian government of carrying out the June 18, 2023 assassination of the Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh activist. in Surrey, British Columbia\n\nMonday morning, the Deputy High Commissioner of Canada to India was summoned by Mr. Modis' government for a widely publicized reprimand. The subject was an appearance Mr. Trudeau made last weekend at a gathering in Toronto to mark Vaisakhi, the anniversary of the founding of the Sikh faith in 1699. It is customary for the leaders of the two main parties attend such events.\n\nSome in the crowd chanted anti-Modi slogans. Others, as some often do at this event, chanted slogans supporting the implausible idea of transforming the Punjab region into a Sikh nation separate from Khalistan. This time, the Indian government decided to make it an international incident: the diplomat was warned that the prime minister's presence amounted to an endorsement of radical Khalistan terrorism.\n\nThis reprimand took place, coincidentally or not, at the very moment when the Washington Post was going to insist to an exhibition who names the top Indian spy, said to be under the command of Mr Modis' national security adviser, and who is accused by the US Department of Justice of ordering and paying for the murder of Mr Nijjar, the attempted the assassination of a Sikh American lawyer in New York and the targeting of prominent Sikhs in Britain and Australia.\n\nThe report describes an offensive-defensive campaign aimed at assassinating and persecuting non-Hindu foreigners who disagree with Mr. Modi's policies. At least five other Canadians, it is claimed, were targeted for assassination.\n\nSome see this Modi-Trudeau impasse over Sikh separatism dating back at least to Mr. Trudeau's chaos. Visit to India in 2018 as detrimental to economic and trade relations between Canada and India, and suggest that Canadian leaders should instead tolerate or ignore New Delhi's extrajudicial acts in order to maintain this relationship.\n\nThe problem is that there are no Khalistani terrorists.\n\nYes, Sikh nationalism was a formidable terrorist movement in the 1980s, responsible for the Air India bombing, which remains Canada's deadliest terrorist incident, and the 1984 assassination of the Prime Minister Indian Indira Gandhi. But after the 1980s, Sikh terrorism disappeared as quickly and completely as Quebec separatist terrorism did after 1970. Today's Khalistani activists constitute a romantic tendency in Western Canada and non-existent in India. It is unwise for Canadian prime ministers to associate with ethnic separatists of any kind, but they are considered by experts to be no more harmful than Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois MPs.\n\nMr. Modi knows this. He does not target them to condemn them, or even assassinate them, because they are in reality terrorists, but because they are Sikhs.\n\nDuring this year's election campaign, in which Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party is plummeting in the polls (but still almost certain to win), he intensified its attacks against Muslims who make up a seventh of India's population and Sikhs, who make up less than 2 percent, but who did not vote for the BJP and have protested and even rejected some of its policies.\n\nIn India, there is no Sikh separatism strictly speaking. writing Hartosh Singh Bal, political analyst in New Delhi. But Mr. Modi invoked the insurgency that once gripped Punjab, saying India's Sikhs are being misled by separatists active abroad and oppose government policies. Assassination attempts are the result of this process. They suggest that New Delhi has come to believe its own propaganda.\n\nMr. Modi is not tackling a threat hosted in Canada, as he claims; it attacks Canada's fundamental values of freedom of expression, pluralism and physical security. The United States has become aware of this, which is why Canadians are learning about it and taking legal action. No Canadian leader, regardless of party, should tolerate or reject Mr. Modi's violent threats.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [],

Because in Canada, actually, today the party in power in Canada, and other parties in Canada have given these kinds of extremism, separatism, and advocates of violence a certain legitimacy in the name of free speech. See, when you tell them something, their answer is no no we are a democratic country but it is free speech,\" S Jaishankar said, ANI reported.\n\nThe union minister, known for aggressively defending India's foreign policy on international forums, said there will be pushback against what is happening \"out there\". He said \"Newton's law of politics\" will apply.\n\n\"The point that they need to understand, it is no longer a world that runs as a one-way street. If there are things that happen out there, there will be pushback. Newton's law of politics will apply there also. There will be a reaction. Others will take steps or counter it,\" S Jaishankar said.\n\nS Jaishankar also slammed Canada for giving visas to \"gangland people\" with links to organised crimes in Punjab.\n\n\"But, the fact is that a number of gangland people, a number of people with organised crime links from Punjab, have been made welcome in Canada. We have been telling Canada saying look these are wanted criminals from India, you have given them visas,\" he said.\n\nS Jaishankar pointed out that many of these people go to Canada on false documentation but are allowed to stay. He accused the country of importing dubious people for political purposes.\n\n\" If you decide to import for political purposes people with very dubious, actually, very negative backgrounds, there will be issues, they have in some cases created problems in their own country as a result of their own policies. No, why would we fear, if something happens there, it is for them to worry about,\" he added.\n\nHardeep Singh Nijjar, a designated terrorist, was killed by gunmen in Canada's Surrey in June last year.

This week, the U.S.-based Washington Post claimed that American officials believe that the R&AW's previous chief Samant Goel had approved an assassination operation, that was foiled last year, against Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Khalistani activist lawyer of U.S. and Canadian nationality on India's most-wanted UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act) terror list. It also revealed the name of a security official, Vikram Yadav, believed to have been at R&AW at the time, and said U.S. officials had discussed whether to indict him for ordering Indian businessman Nikhil Gupta to hire a hitman for the job. In the indictment filed by the U.S. New York Southern District Attorney's office last November, message transcripts indicated Mr. Gupta had also enquired about ordering a \"hit\" on a Khalistani activist in Canada, just days before the killing of Canadian Hardeep Singh Nijjar outside Toronto in June 2023.\n\nOn Friday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested and charged three Indian nationals, all in their twenties, for conspiring in the Nijjar killing, and said they are investigating links to Indian government officials. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's statement indicating a link to Indian agencies, as well as his decision to expel India's intelligence station chief at its High Commission in Ottawa, had sparked a major clash with New Delhi, leading to a number of diplomatic measures and expulsions of Canadian diplomats as well.\n\nWatch | Transnational killings | The legal rights and wrongs\n\nOn Tuesday, Australia's public broadcaster ABC also reported that R&AW operatives had been expelled in 2020 after Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) concluded that they ran a \"nest of spies\" that carried out espionage activities and surveillance of Khalistani separatists in the country. Meanwhile, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry, which has consistently accused R&AW agents of orchestrating a number of extra-judicial killings on its soil, also doubled down on its allegations against India this week. The latest charges have also revived allegations in the U.K. that Indian intelligence agents had trailed and threatened a Khalistani separatist leader Avtar Singh Khanda, who also died in June last year, and was being treated for leukaemia.\n\nHow has New Delhi reacted?\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs has consistently held that extra-judicial killings are not \"government policy\", and called the Washington Post article \"unwarranted and unsubstantiated\". However, two issues cast a cloud over New Delhi's statements. One, the variance in the government's responses on U.S., Canada, Australia and Pakistan: silence on Australia; angry denials and punitive measures against Canada; the setting up of a \"high level inquiry\" into the U.S.'s indictment; and an unabashed acceptance by top leaders that the government has killed terrorists inside Pakistan. \"Today, India doesn't send dossiers. Aaj Bharat ghar mein ghus ke marta hai (Today India kills terrorists in their own homes),\" Mr. Modi said at an election rally in Gujarat this week, ostensibly referring to strikes in 2016 and 2019 on Pakistan, but possibly to other operations as well. Secondly, Indian operations against Khalistani sympathisers have a long history. In 2019, A German court handed prison sentences to an Indian couple charged with spying on Khalistani and Kashmiri activists in the country and sending information to a R&AW official.\n\nIndia awaiting details about the arrest of three Indians in Canada in Nijjar murder case, says Jaishankar\n\nIndian officials have questioned why the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Australia don't take action against vocal Khalistani activists like Pannun and Nijjar themselves, who are accused of inciting attacks on diplomatic missions and threatening Indian diplomats in those countries. They cite a similar refusal by the Canadian government in the 1980s, to act against Khalistani activist Talwinder Singh Parmar, which allowed him to orchestrate the bombing of an Air India plane 'Kanishka' in 1985, one of the worst such terror attacks in which 329 were killed. Parmar was killed during a visit back to India in 1992 in a gunfight with Punjab police.\n\nWill there be a diplomatic fallout?\n\nWith the exception of Pakistan, and now Canada, India's ties with the countries where such operations have allegedly been carried out remain strong. Ties with Canada had seen a brief d\u00e9tente in the past decade but historically, no Indian Prime Minister has made a bilateral visit there since 1973, mainly due to tensions over the Khalistan issue. The issue of Pakistan's support to cross-border terrorism in Jammu & Kashmir and Punjab has led to a nearly-irreversible break in bilateral ties.\n\nAs Canada doubles down on Nijjar allegations, New Zealand says its stand on investigation has not changed\n\nHowever, it is clear that countries like the U.S., the U.K. and Australia are keen to keep ties on an even keel, while they complete investigations and urge India to do the same. As a result, leaders in those countries have barely referred to the cases publicly, unlike Mr. Trudeau. On a number of occasions, including this week, the U.S. White House and State department have issued statements on the Pannun case. \"We continue to expect accountability from the Government of India based on the results of the Indian inquiry committee's work, and we are regularly working with them and enquiring for additional updates,\" Principal Deputy Spokesperson for the State Department, Vedant Patel, said in response to a question about the Washington Post's article this week.\n\nCanadian politician Jagmeet Singh alleges India hand in Nijjar killing\n\nAccording to sources, more has been said behind the scenes. U.S. officials who have visited New Delhi since the Pannun case hit the headlines are understood to have conveyed the U.S.'s 3-step demand: that New Delhi thoroughly investigate the Pannun case and accept any wrongdoing publicly, that it resolve not to repeat such operations, and thirdly, that it must ensure \"legal accountability\" in Indian courts for those responsible. Much will also depend in the next few months on the trial process in both the U.S.'s Pannun case and the Canadian Nijjar case, and how many new credible leads are provided to prove Indian involvement in them. At present, Mr. Gupta is in the Czech Republic, pending an appeal against his extradition, but his testimony is expected to be crucial in the investigations.\n\nIndia is certainly not the only country to be accused of carrying out extra-judicial, extra-territorial attacks, and the U.S., Israel etc. cite the UN charter on self-defence when carrying out killings of those wanted within their country. In the shadowy world of intelligence agencies, however, more informal rules apply: that such operations must not be executed in friendly countries, that there should be no links between the operatives and diplomatic missions, and finally, that they don't get caught.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had informed the House of Commons on September 18, 2023 of \"credible allegations\" linking the Government of India to the murder.\n\nAccording to reports, the individuals arrested today belong to the \"Bishnoi gang\" based out of India. The gang's leader, Lawrence Bishnoi, has been incarcerated in Indian prisons since 2014. He has recently appeared on Indian news media and declaring himself an Indian nationalist and vowing opposition to those who support Khalistan.\n\nThe Bishnoi gang has been implicated in an expansive extortion network targeting businesses in Canada in at least six different cities. Lawrence Bishnoi also took responsibility for the murder of Punjabi rapper Sidhu Moosewala in May 2022. Moosewala, a former Brampton resident, had begun to speak publicly about Khalistan and discrimination faced by Sikhs in India.\n\nIntelligence sources have told CBC News that India has been using criminal gangs to conduct its activities in Canada.\n\nIn the Foreign Interference Commission's report released today, Commissioner Justice Marie-Josee Hogue also found that \"Indian officials in Canada have increasingly relied on Canadian and Canadian-based proxies and the contacts in their networks to conduct foreign interference. This obfuscates any explicit link between India and the foreign interference activities. Proxies liaise and work with Indian intelligence officials in India and in Canada, taking both explicit and implicit direction from them.\"\n\nWSO President Danish Singh said today,\n\n\"While we welcome arrests in the assassination of Bhai Hardeep Singh Nijjar, we believe these arrests raise disturbing questions about the nexus between the Government of India and criminal gangs. How is an Indian criminal who has been in Indian prison since 2014 able to operate a gang targeting Sikhs in Canada for murder and extortion, on this scale?", "source": {"uri": "sikhsiyasat.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sikh Siyasat News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Bishnoi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Bishnoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Sikh_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Sikh Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Commons of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidhu_Moose_Wala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sidhu Moose Wala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sikhism in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjabi language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "News media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brampton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://sikhsiyasat.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WSO.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-09-", "textStart": 279, "textEnd": 291}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

India's image globally is now actually much much higher than it had been ever Canada is an exception. You see the different country heads are praising Bharat and its Prime Minister, the external affairs minister said.\n\nHe said a section of pro-Khalistan people are using Canada's democracy, creating a lobby and have become a vote bank. The ruling party in Canada has no majority in Parliament and some parties depend on pro-Khalistan leaders, he said.\n\nWe have convinced them several times not to give visa, legitimacy or political space to such people which is causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship, Jaishankar said. But the Canadian government has not done anything, Jaishankar said, adding that India sought the extradition of 25 people, most of whom are pro-Khalistan, but they did not pay any heed.\n\nThe ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of the \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar. India has dismissed Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" Canada did not give any proof. They do not share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us. It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India. As election is coming in Canada, they indulge in vote bank politics, the external affairs minister said.\n\nHe said the Indian Prime Minister is regarded highly by many country heads. Recently, the prime minister of a Pacific country touched the feet of Modi while the Australian PM calls Modi as Boss. Even (US) President Biden wanted to know the secret of Modi's popularity, Jaishankar said.\n\nThe external affairs minister admitted that there are some sorts of differences with China and Pakistan. Till the Modi government came we were tolerating it. We were turning the other cheek. We were not acting. After Modi ji came, things have changed. You saw Uri, Balakot. So, we have made it very very clear today that any threat of terrorism, cross border terrorism which comes from Pakistan will get the appropriate response from India,\" he said.\n\nOn the border dispute with China, he said, \"In the last four years, an attempt has been made to put pressure on us by bringing a lot of troops to the Line of Actual Control. We have very strongly countered it. Today, thousands of troops of the Indian Army are on deployment in the line of LAC alongside China. We are very clear, we are there, we are strong, we are deployed. When it comes to national security, the Modi government will never make a compromise, he said.\n\nOn Nepal's move to replace its Rs 100 currency note with a map that shows the disputed territories with India is unilaterally, Jaishankar said that it is not going to change the situation on the ground. The Nepal government on Friday announced the printing of a new Rs 100 currency note with a map that shows the controversial territories of Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura and Kalapani, already termed as artificial enlargement and untenable by India.\n\nTo a question, he said that some Indians are trapped in Cambodia, where they are allegedly being held against their will and forced to carry out cyber frauds. He said such cases have been noticed and the ministry in Delhi and the Indian embassy in Cambodia are very active on this issue.\n\nI personally took up this issue with the government in Cambodia. We know that some people, including a few from Odisha, have returned home, Jaishankar said. The minister informed that similar cases were also reported in Myanmar, Thailand and Russia.\n\nWe are very much on alert. In some cases, Indians have been taken through agents. We have issued a very clear order to file cases against such persons and ask the concerned government to prosecute them.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khalistan movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaishankar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaishankar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

In recent speeches, Mr. Modi has taken credible accusations from Western officials that his government has sent agents abroad to kill Canadians and other foreigners - the most overt form of foreign interference - and turned them into taunts.\n\n\"Today, even India's enemies know: This is Modi, this is the New India,\" he said at an April 5 rally, according to The Washington Post. \"This New India comes into your home to kill you.\"\n\nThat threat, aimed at Muslim and Sikh foreigners his party considers enemies, was repeated on Tuesday, as reported by India's NDTV: With regard to foreigners \"who look at our borders with malicious intent,\" he bragged at an event, \"India no longer sends [documents], it kills enemies in their homes.\"\n\nTwo incidents this week made it clear that this language is intended at least in part to taunt Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who last year accused India's government of carrying out the June 18, 2023, assassination of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh activist, in Surrey, B.C.\n\nOn Monday morning, Canada's deputy high commissioner to India was summoned by Mr. Modi's government for a widely publicized reprimand. The subject was an appearance made by Mr. Trudeau last weekend at a Toronto rally to mark Vaisakhi, the anniversary of the founding of the Sikh faith in 1699. It has been customary for leaders of both major parties to attend such events.\n\nSome in the crowd shouted anti-Modi slogans. Others, as some often do at this event, chanted slogans supporting the implausible idea of turning the Punjab region into a separate Sikh nation of Khalistan. This time, India's government decided to make it an international incident: The diplomat was warned that the Prime Minister's attendance amounted to an endorsement of radical Khalistani \"terrorism.\"\n\nThat rebuke took place, coincidentally or otherwise, just as The Washington Post was going to press with an expos\u00e9 that named the senior Indian spy, reportedly under the command of Mr. Modi's national-security adviser, who is accused by the U.S. Justice Department of having ordered and paid for the killing of Mr. Nijjar, the attempted murder of an American Sikh lawyer in New York, and the targeting of prominent Sikhs in Britain and Australia.\n\nThe report described a campaign of \"defensive offence\" aimed at assassinating and persecuting foreign non-Hindus who are at odds with Mr. Modi's policies. At least five other Canadians, it claimed, were assassination targets.\n\nSome view this Modi-Trudeau standoff over Sikh separatism - which dates back at least to Mr. Trudeau's shambolic India visit in 2018 - as harmful to the Canada-India economic and trade relationship, and suggest that Canadian leaders instead ought to tolerate or ignore New Delhi's extrajudicial acts in order to maintain that relationship.\n\nThe problem is that there are no \"Khalistani terrorists.\"\n\nYes, Sikh nationalism was a fearsome terrorist movement in the 1980s, responsible for the Air India bombing, which remains Canada's deadliest terrorist incident, and for the 1984 assassination of Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi. But after the 80s, Sikh terrorism vanished as quickly and completely as Quebec-separatist terrorism did after 1970. Today's Khalistani activists are a romantic tendency in Western Canada, and non-existent in India. It is not wise for Canadian prime ministers to be associating with ethnic separatists of any variety, but these ones are considered by experts to be no more harmful than Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois MPs.\n\nMr. Modi knows this. He does not target them for condemnation, and perhaps for assassination, because they are actually terrorists, but because they are Sikh.\n\nIn this year's election campaign, in which Mr. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party is slumping in the polls (but is still almost sure to win), he has amped up his attacks on Muslims - who make up one-seventh of India's population - and on Sikhs, who comprise less than 2 per cent, but have not been voting BJP and have protested and even defeated some of his policies.\n\n\"Within India, there is no Sikh separatism to speak of,\" writes New Delhi political analyst Hartosh Singh Bal. But Mr. Modi \"has invoked the insurgency that once afflicted Punjab, arguing that Indian Sikhs are being duped by separatists active abroad into opposing the government's policies. ... The assassination attempts are the result of this process. They suggest that New Delhi has come to believe its own propaganda.\"\n\nMr. Modi is not attacking a threat harboured within Canada, as he claims; he is attacking Canada's fundamental values of freedom of speech, pluralism and physical security. The United States has realized this - which is why Canadians know about it - and is taking legal action. No Canadian leader, of any party, should tolerate or dismiss Mr. Modi's violent threats.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [],

However, he noted that Canada remains an exception due to the influence of pro-Khalistan individuals who have become a significant vote bank in the country.\n\n\"India's image globally is now actually much much higher than it had been ever... Canada is an exception. You see the different country heads are praising Bharat and its Prime Minister,\" the external affairs minister said.\n\nJaishankar emphasized that India has repeatedly urged Canada not to provide visas, legitimacy, or political space to such individuals, as it causes problems for both countries and their relationship.\n\n\"We have convinced them several times not to give visa, legitimacy or political space to such people which is causing problems for them (Canada), for us and also for our relationship,\" Jaishankar said.\n\nDespite India's efforts to seek the extradition of 25 people, mostly pro-Khalistan, the Canadian government has not taken any action, he said.\n\nRelations between India and Canada deteriorated significantly after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged last September of potential involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar. India has dismissed Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\"\n\nJaishankar stated, \"Canada did not give any proof. They do not share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us. It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India. As election is coming in Canada, they indulge in vote bank politics.\"\n\nThe external affairs minister also touched upon India's relationships with China and Pakistan, asserting that the Modi government has taken a firm stance against any threats of terrorism or cross-border terrorism from Pakistan. Regarding the border dispute with China, Jaishankar said that India has strongly countered the pressure exerted by the deployment of Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Ex-British prime ministers get knighthoods and life peerages. Ex-U.S. presidents get lifelong Secret Service details and multi-million dollar budgets to design their Presidential Library.\n\nBut Canadian first ministers are immediately stripped of security and staff, evicted from their home and cast aside from every trapping of their office except the authorization to use the title \"Right Honourable.\" They also lose access to a level of executive power that is famously well beyond that of any other Western democratic leader.\n\nIn a manner of weeks, the Canadian prime minister goes from G7 summits and Five Eyes security briefings to marking time at a law office and going incognito to the local McDonalds.\n\nThree Indian nationals were arrested in Edmonton and charged in connection with the June 2023 assassination of radical Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, B.C. This was the murder that sent India-Canada relations into a deep freeze after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly accused the Indian government of orchestrating the killing (Nijjar was an extremist Khalistani separatist that New Delhi considered a terrorist). Awkwardly, Trudeau wasn't able to present any evidence at the time linking the Indian government to Nijjar's shooting. But a U.S. indictment filed in December showed that Trudeau was probably acting on a tip from the Americans. The U.S. Department of Justice uncovered what they called a \"murder for hire\" plot being run in North America by an employee of the Indian government. The alleged plot appeared to consist of little more than calling around for hitmen to kill figures associated with Khalistani separatism. While U.S. law enforcement was immediately able to interdict the murder-for-hire plot in its own country, the indictment alleged that the strategy seemed to have worked in Canada.\n\nGet all of these

Nijjar, a Canadian citizen, was killed in the parking lot his gurdwara in Surrey, B.C.\n\nThe arrests today are the result of months of work by the RCMP's Integrated Homicide Investigation Team, supported by the Federal Policing Program, the Surrey RCMP Detachment and other partner agencies. The work doesn't end here and, as the work continues, I will underscore that there are separate and distinct investigations ongoing.\n\nCanada is a rule of law country and the protection of our citizens are fundamental. Every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free of threats of violence.\n\nThe murder of Mr. Nijjar was a shock to the community in Surrey and indeed all Canadians. My thoughts are with Mr. Nijjar's family, friends and community members. Today's arrests mark significant progress in the work of the RCMP to holding those responsible for killing Mr. Nijjar accountable for their actions through our justice system.\n\nWhile today's actions by the RCMP may be welcome news, I know that many Canadians, particularly members of the Indo-Canadian community, may still have questions or concerns. I encourage everyone affected by this to put their trust in the justice system and know that your safety is our priority. My department and its security partners continue to work closely with provinces, territories, municipalities and local police to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians.\n\nOver the coming days, my department officials and I will continue to engage with key stakeholders and community groups. We want to hear their concerns and work with them to foster trust and open communications.\n\nI would like to thank the RCMP and their law enforcement partners for their thorough investigation that resulted in the arrests and charges announced today.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Intergovernmental_Affairs,_Infrastructure_and_Communities", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Infrastructure and Communities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Public_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Public Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_LeBlanc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominic LeBlanc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_nationality_law", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian nationality law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurdwara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Canadians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indo-Canadians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537404", "eventUri": "eng-9537404", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Bhai Nijjar, 45, was found with fatal gunshot wounds inside his vehicle.\n\nWho Are Arrested Accused:\n\nThe accused, identified as 22-year-old Karan Brar, 22-year-old Kamalpreet Singh, and 28-year-old Karanpreet Singh, all residents of Edmonton, have been charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in relation to Bhai Nijjar's assassination.\n\nThe arrest of the suspects was made possible through collaborative efforts between IHIT, the Surrey RCMP, and the Edmonton Police Service, officials said during a press conference.\n\nAbout Nature of Evidence:\n\nAssistant Commissioner David Teboul said- \"[w]e are not able to make any comments about the nature of the evidence collected by police nor can we speak about the motive behind the murder of Mr. Nijjar. However, understanding this situation has attracted considerable and very broad public interest, I will say this matter is still very much under active investigation\".\n\nWhat Officials said about Connections to the Govt. of India:\n\n\"I will underscore that today's announcements are not a complete account of the investigative work currently underway.

CBC reported citing undisclosed sources familiar with the investigation, the arrested individuals are allegedly connected to the Lawrance Bishnoi gang.

Nijjar, a Canadian citizen, was killed in the parking lot his gurdwara in Surrey, B.C.\n\nThe arrests today are the result of months of work by the RCMP's Integrated Homicide Investigation Team, supported by the Federal Policing Program, the Surrey RCMP Detachment and other partner agencies. The work doesn't end here and, as the work continues, I will underscore that there are separate and distinct investigations ongoing.\n\nCanada is a rule of law country and the protection of our citizens are fundamental. Every Canadian has the fundamental right to live safely and free of threats of violence.\n\nThe murder of Mr. Nijjar was a shock to the community in Surrey and indeed all Canadians. My thoughts are with Mr. Nijjar's family, friends and community members. Today's arrests mark significant progress in the work of the RCMP to holding those responsible for killing Mr. Nijjar accountable for their actions through our justice system.\n\nWhile today's actions by the RCMP may be welcome news, I know that many Canadians, particularly members of the Indo-Canadian community, may still have questions or concerns. I encourage everyone affected by this to put their trust in the justice system and know that your safety is our priority. My department and its security partners continue to work closely with provinces, territories, municipalities and local police to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians.\n\nOver the coming days, my department officials and I will continue to engage with key stakeholders and community groups. We want to hear their concerns and work with them to foster trust and open communications.\n\nI would like to thank the RCMP and their law enforcement partners for their thorough investigation that resulted in the arrests and charges announced today.\"\n\n/Public Release.

As Prime Minister he delivered on all fronts - starting from salvaging the nation from an utter state of despair to hope and aspiration. People of all sections were taken up. Country made progress on all sectors and an economy boomed. People appreciated PM Modi's performances and blessed him with another term in 2019.

As Prime Minister he delivered on all fronts - starting from salvaging the nation from an utter state of despair to hope and aspiration. People of all sections were taken up. Country made progress on all sectors and an economy boomed. People appreciated PM Modi's performances and blessed him with another term in 2019. Now, after 10 years, people's trust in him has doubled and they have reposed faith in his leadership to take the country on the path of progress to reach our goal of Viksit Bharat,\" he said during an interaction with editors of different newspapers and television channels.\n\nSpeaking on the foreign policy of India, Jaishankar said India is playing the role of a peace-broker across the globe as the world leaders trust the country's leadership.\n\n\"Now, you see turmoil in different parts of the world.

You can see Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as an exception. What's the reason? Some people who profess Khalistani ideology have made use of that democracy and formed a lobby and vote bank. Some parties in Canada, some parties in that country feel that if they maintain good relationships with these people, it will benefit. It's all about vote bank politics in Canada. Now, the matter is more serious because the Trudeau government lacks a majority in the parliament. The leaders of other political parties on whom Trudeau is dependent are pro-Khalistani.\"\n\nThe minister said though India wrote to Canada for extradition of 25 Khalistani leaders, the latter did not take any action on that.\n\nTo a query, Jaishankar said Odisha should have a BJP government to carry forward the development of the Narendra Modi government.\n\n\"I concur what Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently said that Odisha has not progressed much in the past two decades despite it having huge mineral resources. We need to have a young person with a sharp outlook to lead the state,\" he observed.\n\nJaishankar is currently on a two-day trip to Odisha to interact with the intellectuals, journalists and BJP party workers.", "source": {"uri": "deccanchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

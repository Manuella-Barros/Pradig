But he is arguing in court that only by empowering Lachlan to run the company without interference from his more politically moderate siblings can he preserve its conservative editorial bent, and thus protect its commercial value for all his heirs.\n\nThose three siblings -- James, Elisabeth and Prudence -- were caught completely off-guard by their father's effort to rewrite what was supposed to be an inviolable trust and have united to stop him. Remarkably, the ensuing battle has been playing out entirely out of public view.\n\nLast month, the Nevada probate commissioner found that Murdoch could amend the trust if he is able to show he is acting in good faith and for the sole benefit of his heirs, according to a copy of his 48-page decision.\n\nA trial to determine whether Murdoch is in fact acting in good faith is expected to start in September. Hanging in the balance will be the future of one of the most politically influential media companies in the English-speaking world.\n\nRepresentatives for the two sides declined to comment. Both have hired high-powered litigators. The three Murdoch siblings are represented by Gary A. Bornstein, the co-head of litigation at Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Rupert Murdoch is represented by Adam Streisand, a trial lawyer at Sheppard Mullin who has been involved in estate disputes concerning Michael Jackson and Britney Spears.\n\nFew media stories have been watched as closely as the succession battle over the Murdoch empire, both because of the irresistibly Shakespearean nature of the drama, and because of the empire's outsize political influence. Murdoch's decision in 2018 to formally designate Lachlan as his heir put to rest years of speculation over his wishes for the company.\n\nWhat it did not do, though, was ensure that Murdoch's wishes would survive him: The existing trust gives all four of his oldest children an equal voice in the company's future.\n\nThe Murdoch family has been divided before. James and Elisabeth at one point competed with each other and Lachlan to eventually take over the company, and at various times they have clashed with one another and their father. James, who once helped run the company with Lachlan, left it in 2019 and now oversees an investment fund. Elisabeth runs a successful movie studio, Sister, and has for years sought to position herself as the \"Switzerland\" of the family, maintaining good relations with all. Prudence, Murdoch's oldest child and the only one from his first marriage, has been the least involved in the family business and has remained the most private of the children.\n\nBut given Murdoch's advanced age, this battle has all of the makings of a final fight for control of his sprawling media conglomerates, which own Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and major newspapers and television outlets in Australia and Britain. It has already driven a new wedge into the famously fractured family.\n\nPolitics, and power, are at the root of the struggle. Since Murdoch designed the trust nearly 25 years ago, the family's political views have diverged sharply. During Donald Trump's rise, Murdoch and Lachlan became more closely aligned, pushing the company's most influential outlet, Fox News, further to the right, making the other three children increasingly uncomfortable.\n\nMurdoch has called his effort to change the trust Project Harmony because he hoped that it might head off a looming family struggle when he dies, according to a person with knowledge of the family. But it has had the opposite effect.\n\nAfter filing his petition to amend the trust, Murdoch met separately with Elisabeth and Prudence in London, hoping to win their support, this person said. Instead, they were furious. Elisabeth responded to the possibility with a string of expletives.\n\nDays later, on Dec. 6, Murdoch's representatives went ahead with the motion to make the changes at a hastily called special meeting of the trust in Reno, Nevada. The representatives for the three children sought to adjourn the meeting and block the proposed changes but failed, according to the court decision.\n\nThe fight has left Murdoch estranged from three of his children in his twilight years. None of them attended his wedding to Elena Zhukova, his fifth wife, in California last month. (Lachlan did.)\n\nThough the trust is irrevocable, it contains a narrow provision allowing for changes done in good faith and with the sole purpose of benefiting all of its members. Murdoch's lawyers have argued that he is trying to protect James, Elisabeth and Prudence by ensuring that they won't be able to moderate Fox's politics or disrupt its operations with constant fights over leadership.\n\nAccording to the court's decision, Murdoch was concerned that the \"lack of consensus\" among his children \"would impact the strategic direction at both companies including a potential reorientation of editorial policy and content.\" It states that his intention was to \"consolidate decision-making power in Lachlan's hands and give him permanent, exclusive control\" over the company.\n\nThe document makes it clear that Murdoch's actions have pushed Elisabeth, Prudence and James into a joint posture against him. The siblings share a single legal counsel and are fighting to retain their voice in the company's future, arguing that their father is trying to disenfranchise them. They say that Murdoch's move violates the spirit of the initial trust, enshrined in its \"equal governance provision,\" and that it was not done in good faith.\n\nThis will be one of the main issues in the trial. As the Nevada probate commissioner, Edmund Gorman Jr., wrote in his decision: \"A rational fact finder could find that the determination that the Amendment was in the best interests of the beneficiaries was made with '[d]ishonesty of belief, purpose, or motive,' i.e., in bad faith.\"\n\nThe action is taking place in a Reno probate court, which is devoted to dealing with family trusts and estates. Nevada is a popular state for dynastic family trusts because of its favorable probate laws and privacy protections. The decision obtained by the Times contains a review of the facts by a probate commissioner whose role is to adjudicate cases before sending any unresolved issues to a judge for trial, as he did here.\n\nThe trust holds the family's shares in Murdoch's empire, which is now mainly divided between two companies: Fox, which includes Fox News and the Fox broadcast network, and News Corp., which holds his major newspapers.\n\nAll six of Murdoch's children have an equal share of the trust's equity. That includes Chloe and Grace, the two younger children he had with his third wife, Wendi Deng. But those two have no voting rights.\n\nAs of now, the voting rights are shared among Murdoch and his four oldest children through their own hand-picked representatives on the trust's board. But Murdoch has the ultimate control and cannot be outvoted. After he dies, Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence each get a single vote. As Murdoch put it in an interview with Charlie Rose in 2006: \"If I go under a bus tomorrow, it will be the four of them who will have to decide which of the ones should lead them.\"\n\nThe probate commissioner's review of the facts shows that Murdoch is moving to expand Lachlan's voting power to secure a majority and ensure that he cannot be challenged. The changes would not affect anyone's ownership stake in the company.\n\nTo bolster his argument that he's making the change in order to benefit all of his heirs, Murdoch has moved to replace two of his longtime executives as his personal representatives on the trust with two people with more independence. One is Bill Barr, an attorney general under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Trump, who was also a guest at Murdoch's most recent wedding.\n\nThe court document shows that Barr is leading Murdoch's effort to rewrite the trust. It quotes Barr's statement to the court when he introduced Murdoch's move at the special meeting of the trust on Dec. 6. Murdoch, he said, \"knew the companies and the environment better than anyone else and believed that Lachlan was in the best position to carry on that successful strategy.\"\n\nThe basic contours of the trust date back to Murdoch's divorce from his second wife, Anna Mann, mother to James, Elisabeth and Lachlan. Murdoch divorced Mann before marrying Deng in 1999.\n\nConcerned about the destructive potential of a dynastic succession fight, Mann insisted that the divorce settlement give the four children equal control over the empire, people close to the family have said. As part of their agreement, Murdoch locked this provision in place permanently through an irrevocable trust.\n\nBut Murdoch came to see that provision as untenable after he placed Lachlan in charge of Fox and News Corp. in 2019. A primary source of the problem was his younger son, James, who had been passed over in favor of Lachlan. In recent years, people close to James and his wife, Kathryn, have said that after Murdoch's death they would consider joining with Elisabeth and Prudence to wrest control from Lachlan and tame the companies' wilder right-wing instincts.\n\nJames and Lachlan shared operating responsibility for the companies from 2015 to 2019, a relationship that frayed during the Trump administration, as the two split over Fox's fawning treatment of Trump. Lachlan and his father dismissed James' concerns, pointing to the network's record ratings. James left the business following Lachlan's ascension to chair and CEO in 2019, and stepped down from the News Corp. board in 2020, citing \"disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company's news outlets.\"\n\nJames and Kathryn, a longtime climate change activist, remain occasional, and cautious, public critics of the family empire. After wildfires ravaged Australia in early 2020 they shared their \"frustration with some of the News Corp. and Fox coverage\" of climate change in a statement to The Daily Beast, noting \"the ongoing denial among the news outlets in Australia.\" After the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol in Washington, James indirectly criticized Fox News, saying that unnamed \"outlets that propagate lies to their audience\" had \"unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years.\"\n\nIn the spring of 2019, Murdoch's children -- including the two children he had with Deng -- received payouts of roughly $2 billion each from Murdoch's sale of his movie studios and other assets to the Walt Disney Co. James and Kathryn announced at the time that they would devote part of that fortune to causes such as climate change and combating \"high-tech illiberalism.\"\n\nAccording to several of his associates, Murdoch has come to resent James' criticisms and complaints, given that the family empire, which Murdoch built almost single-handedly, has made James and his siblings multibillionaires. The court document indicates that Murdoch's representatives have referred to him in their own communications as the \"troublesome beneficiary.\"\n\nJames had differed with his father and brother over Fox News, arguing its play to Trump for short-term ratings gains would undercut its parent company's long-term prospects, a fight he lost before parting ways with them.\n\nSince leaving the company, James has been managing his own portfolio of investments, with a controlling interest in the company that runs Art Basel and major stakes in media companies in India.\n\nIt has always been unclear how serious James was about trying to make any move against Lachlan, or if he would have the backing of his sisters for such an effort. The fact that they have come together to preserve the trust suggests that he and his sisters are now solidly aligned against Lachlan, and that they may well try to oust him, or at least try to influence the direction of the company, after their father's death.\n\nWhether they will have the legal power to do so will soon be determined in a courtroom in Reno.", "source": {"uri":

Several of his children are fighting back.\n\nRupert Murdoch is locked in a secret legal battle against three of his children over the future of the family's media empire, as he moves to preserve it as a conservative political force after his death, according to a sealed court document obtained by The New York Times.\n\nMurdoch, 93, set the drama in motion late last year, when he made a surprise move to change the terms of the Murdochs' irrevocable family trust to ensure that his eldest son and chosen successor, Lachlan, would remain in charge of his vast collection of television networks and newspapers.\n\nThe trust currently hands control of the family business to the four oldest children when Murdoch dies. But he is arguing in court that only by empowering Lachlan to run the company without interference from his more politically moderate siblings can he preserve its conservative editorial bent, and thus protect its commercial value for all his heirs.\n\nThose three siblings - James, Elisabeth and Prudence - were caught completely off-guard by their father's effort to rewrite what was supposed to be an inviolable trust and have united to stop him. Remarkably, the ensuing battle has been playing out entirely out of public view.\n\nLast month, the Nevada probate commissioner found that Murdoch could amend the trust if he is able to show he is acting in good faith and for the sole benefit of his heirs, according to a copy of his 48-page decision.\n\nA trial to determine whether Murdoch is in fact acting in good faith is expected to start in September. Hanging in the balance will be the future of one of the most politically influential media companies in the English-speaking world.\n\nRepresentatives for the two sides declined to comment. Both have hired high-powered litigators. The three Murdoch siblings are represented by Gary A. Bornstein, the co-head of litigation at Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Rupert Murdoch is represented by Adam Streisand, a trial lawyer at Sheppard Mullin who has been involved in estate disputes concerning Michael Jackson and Britney Spears.\n\nFew media stories have been watched as closely as the succession battle over the Murdoch empire, both because of the irresistibly Shakespearean nature of the drama, and because of the empire's outsize political influence. Murdoch's decision in 2018 to formally designate Lachlan as his heir put to rest years of speculation over his wishes for the company.\n\nWhat it did not do, though, was ensure that Murdoch's wishes would survive him: The existing trust gives all four of his oldest children an equal voice in the company's future.\n\nThe Murdoch family has been divided before. James and Elisabeth at one point competed with each other and Lachlan to eventually take over the company, and at various times they have clashed with one another and their father. James, who once helped run the company with Lachlan, left it in 2019 and now oversees an investment fund. Elisabeth runs a successful movie studio, Sister, and has for years sought to position herself as the \"Switzerland\" of the family, maintaining good relations with all. Prudence, Murdoch's oldest child and the only one from his first marriage, has been the least involved in the family business and has remained the most private of the children.\n\nBut given Murdoch's advanced age, this battle has all of the makings of a final fight for control of his sprawling media conglomerates, which own Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and major newspapers and television outlets in Australia and Britain. It has already driven a new wedge into the famously fractured family.\n\nPolitics, and power, are at the root of the struggle. Since Murdoch designed the trust nearly 25 years ago, the family's political views have diverged sharply. During Donald Trump's rise, Murdoch and Lachlan became more closely aligned, pushing the company's most influential outlet, Fox News, further to the right, making the other three children increasingly uncomfortable.\n\nMurdoch has called his effort to change the trust Project Harmony because he hoped that it might head off a looming family struggle when he dies, according to a person with knowledge of the family. But it has had the opposite effect.\n\nAfter filing his petition to amend the trust, Murdoch met separately with Elisabeth and Prudence in London, hoping to win their support, this person said. Instead, they were furious. Elisabeth responded to the possibility with a string of expletives.\n\nDays later, on December 6, Murdoch's representatives went ahead with the motion to make the changes at a hastily called special meeting of the trust in Reno, Nevada. The representatives for the three children sought to adjourn the meeting and block the proposed changes but failed, according to the court decision.\n\nThe fight has left Murdoch estranged from three of his children in his twilight years. None of them attended his wedding to Elena Zhukova, his fifth wife, in California last month. (Lachlan did.)\n\nThough the trust is irrevocable, it contains a narrow provision allowing for changes done in good faith and with the sole purpose of benefiting all of its members. Murdoch's lawyers have argued that he is trying to protect James, Elisabeth and Prudence by ensuring that they won't be able to moderate Fox's politics or disrupt its operations with constant fights over leadership.\n\nAccording to the court's decision, Murdoch was concerned that the \"lack of consensus\" among his children \"would impact the strategic direction at both companies including a potential reorientation of editorial policy and content.\" It states that his intention was to \"consolidate decision-making power in Lachlan's hands and give him permanent, exclusive control\" over the company.\n\nThe document makes it clear that Murdoch's actions have pushed Elisabeth, Prudence and James into a joint posture against him. The siblings share a single legal counsel and are fighting to retain their voice in the company's future, arguing that their father is trying to disenfranchise them. They say that Murdoch's move violates the spirit of the initial trust, enshrined in its \"equal governance provision,\" and that it was not done in good faith.\n\nThis will be one of the main issues in the trial. As the Nevada probate commissioner, Edmund Gorman Jr., wrote in his decision: \"A rational fact finder could find that the determination that the Amendment was in the best interests of the beneficiaries was made with '[d]ishonesty of belief, purpose, or motive,' i.e., in bad faith.\"\n\nThe action is taking place in a Reno probate court, which is devoted to dealing with family trusts and estates. Nevada is a popular state for dynastic family trusts because of its favourable probate laws and privacy protections. The decision obtained by the Times contains a review of the facts by a probate commissioner whose role is to adjudicate cases before sending any unresolved issues to a judge for trial, as he did here.\n\nThe trust holds the family's shares in Murdoch's empire, which is now mainly divided between two companies: Fox, which includes Fox News and the Fox broadcast network, and News Corp., which holds his major newspapers.\n\nAll six of Murdoch's children have an equal share of the trust's equity. That includes Chloe and Grace, the two younger children he had with his third wife, Wendi Deng. But those two have no voting rights.\n\nAs of now, the voting rights are shared among Murdoch and his four oldest children through their own hand-picked representatives on the trust's board. But Murdoch has the ultimate control and cannot be outvoted. After he dies, Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence each get a single vote.

The changes would not affect anyone's ownership stake in the company.\n\nTo bolster his argument that he's making the change in order to benefit all of his heirs, Murdoch has moved to replace two of his longtime executives as his personal representatives on the trust with two people with more independence.

James and Kathryn announced at the time that they would devote part of that fortune to causes such as climate change and combating \"high-tech illiberalism.\"\n\nAccording to several of his associates, Murdoch has come to resent James' criticisms and complaints, given that the family empire, which Murdoch built almost single-handedly, has made James and his siblings multibillionaires.

But he is arguing in court that only by empowering Lachlan to run the company without interference from his more politically moderate siblings can he preserve its conservative editorial bent, and thus protect its commercial value for all his heirs.\n\nThose three siblings - James, Elisabeth and Prudence - were caught completely off-guard by their father's effort to rewrite what was supposed to be an inviolable trust and have united to stop him. Remarkably, the ensuing battle has been playing out entirely out of public view.\n\nIn June, the Nevada probate commissioner found that Mr Murdoch could amend the trust if he is able to show he is acting in good faith and for the sole benefit of his heirs, according to a copy of his 48-page decision.\n\nA trial to determine whether Mr Murdoch is in fact acting in good faith is expected to start in September. Hanging in the balance will be the future of one of the most politically influential media companies in the English-speaking world.\n\nRepresentatives for the two sides declined to comment. Both have hired high-powered litigators. The three Murdoch siblings are represented by Mr Gary A Bornstein, the co-head of litigation at Cravath, Swaine and Moore. Mr Rupert Murdoch is represented by Mr Adam Streisand, a trial lawyer at Sheppard Mullin who has been involved in estate disputes concerning Michael Jackson and Britney Spears.\n\nFew media stories have been watched as closely as the succession battle over the Murdoch empire, both because of the irresistibly Shakespearean nature of the drama, and because of the empire's outsize political influence. Mr Murdoch's decision in 2018 to formally designate Lachlan as his heir put to rest years of speculation over his wishes for the company.\n\nWhat it did not do, though, was ensure that Mr Murdoch's wishes would survive him: The existing trust gives all four of his oldest children an equal voice in the company's future.\n\nThe Murdoch family has been divided before. James and Elisabeth at one point competed with each other and Lachlan to eventually take over the company, and at various times they have clashed with one another and their father. James, who once helped run the company with Lachlan, left it in 2019 and now oversees an investment fund. Elisabeth runs a successful movie studio, Sister, and has for years sought to position herself as the \"Switzerland\" of the family, maintaining good relations with all. Prudence, Mr Murdoch's oldest child and the only one from his first marriage, has been the least involved in the family business and has remained the most private of the children.\n\nBut given Mr Murdoch's advanced age, this battle has all of the makings of a final fight for control of his sprawling media conglomerates, which own Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and major newspapers and television outlets in Australia and Britain. It has already driven a new wedge into the famously fractured family.\n\nPolitics, and power, are at the root of the struggle. Since Mr Murdoch designed the trust nearly 25 years ago, the family's political views have diverged sharply. During Donald Trump's rise, Mr Murdoch and Lachlan became more closely aligned, pushing the company's most influential outlet, Fox News, further to the right, making the other three children increasingly uncomfortable.\n\nMr Murdoch has called his effort to change the trust Project Harmony because he hoped that it might head off a looming family struggle when he dies, according to a person with knowledge of the family.

But it has had the opposite effect.\n\nAfter filing his petition to amend the trust, Mr. Murdoch met separately with Elisabeth and Prudence in London, hoping to win their support, this person said. Instead, they were furious. Elisabeth responded to the possibility with a string of expletives.\n\nDays later, on Dec. 6, Mr. Murdoch's representatives went ahead with the motion to make the changes at a hastily called special meeting of the trust in Reno, Nev. The representatives for the three children sought to adjourn the meeting and block the proposed changes but failed, according to the court decision.\n\nThe fight has left Mr. Murdoch estranged him from three of his children in his twilight years. None of them attended his wedding to Elena Zhukova in California last month. (Lachlan did.)\n\nThough the trust is irrevocable, it contains a narrow provision allowing for changes done in good faith and with the sole purpose of benefiting all of its members. Mr. Murdoch's lawyers have argued that he is trying to protect James, Elisabeth and Prudence by ensuring that they won't be able to moderate Fox's politics or disrupt its operations with constant fights over leadership.\n\nAccording to the court's decision, Mr. Murdoch was concerned that the \"lack of consensus\" among his children \"would impact the strategic direction at both companies including a potential reorientation of editorial policy and content.\" It states that his intention was to \"consolidate decision-making power in Lachlan's hands and give him permanent, exclusive control\" over the company.\n\nThe document makes it clear that Mr. Murdoch's actions have pushed Elisabeth, Prudence and James into a joint posture against him. The siblings share the single legal counsel and are fighting to retain their voice in the company's future, arguing that their father is trying to disenfranchise them. They say Mr. Murdoch's move violates the spirit of the initial trust, enshrined in its \"equal governance provision,\" and that it was not done in good faith.\n\nThis will be one of the main issues in the trial. As the Nevada probate commissioner, Edmund Gorman Jr., wrote in his decision: \"A rational fact finder could find that the determination that the Amendment was in the best interests of the beneficiaries was made with '[d]ishonesty of belief, purpose, or motive,' i.e., in bad faith.\"\n\nThe action is taking place in a Reno probate court, which is devoted to dealing with family trusts and estates. Nevada is a popular state for dynastic family trusts because of its favorable probate laws and privacy protections. The decision obtained by The Times contains a review of the facts by a probate commissioner whose role is to adjudicate cases before sending any unresolved issues to a judge for trial, as he did here.\n\nThe trust holds the family's shares in Mr. Murdoch's empire, which is now mainly divided between two companies: Fox, which includes Fox News and the Fox broadcast network, and News Corporation, which holds his major newspapers.\n\nAll six of Mr. Murdoch's children have an equal share of the trust's equity. That includes Chloe and Grace, the two younger children he had with his third wife, Wendi Deng. But those two have no voting rights.\n\nAs of now, the voting rights are shared among Mr. Murdoch and his four oldest children through their own handpicked representatives on the trust's board. But Mr. Murdoch has the ultimate control and cannot be outvoted. After he dies, Lachlan, James, Elizabeth and Prudence each get a single vote. As Mr. Murdoch put it in an interview with Charlie Rose in 2006: \"If I go under a bus tomorrow, it will be the four of them who will have to decide which of the ones should lead them.\"\n\nThe probate commissioner's review of the facts shows that Mr. Murdoch is moving to expand Lachlan's voting power to secure a majority and ensure that he cannot be challenged. The changes would not affect anyone's ownership stake in the company.\n\nTo bolster his argument that he's making the change in order to benefit all of his heirs, Mr. Murdoch has moved to replace two of his longtime executives as his personal representatives on the trust with two people with more independence. One is William P. Barr, an attorney general under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Trump, who was also a guest at Mr. Murdoch's most recent wedding.\n\nThe court document shows that Mr. Barr is leading Mr. Murdoch's effort to rewrite the trust. It quotes Mr. Barr's statement to the court when he introduced Mr. Murdoch's move at the special meeting of the trust on Dec. 6. Mr. Murdoch, he said, \"knew the companies and the environment better than anyone else and believed that Lachlan was in the best position to carry on that successful strategy.\"\n\nThe basic contours of the trust date back to Murdoch's divorce from his second wife, Anna Mann, mother to James, Elizabeth and Lachlan, whom Mr. Murdoch divorced before marrying Ms. Deng in 1999.\n\nConcerned about the destructive potential of a dynastic succession fight, Ms. Mann insisted that the divorce settlement give the four children equal control over the empire, people close to the family have said. As part of their agreement, Mr. Murdoch locked this provision in place permanently through an irrevocable trust.\n\nBut Mr. Murdoch came to see that provision as untenable after he placed Lachlan in charge of Fox and News Corporation in 2019. A primary source of the problem was his younger son, James, who had been passed over in favor of Lachlan. In recent years, people close to James and his wife Kathryn have said that after Mr. Murdoch's death they would consider joining with Elisabeth and Prudence to wrest control from Lachlan and tame the companies' wilder right wing instincts.\n\nJames and Lachlan shared operating responsibility for the companies from 2015 to 2019, a relationship that frayed during the Trump administration, as the two split over Fox's fawning treatment of Mr. Trump. Lachlan and his father dismissed James's concerns, pointing to the network's record ratings. James left the business following Lachlan's ascension to chairman and chief executive in 2019, and stepped down from the News Corporation board in 2020, citing \"disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company's news outlets.\"\n\nJames and his wife, Kathryn, a longtime climate change activist, remain occasional, and cautious, public critics of the family empire. After wildfires ravaged Australia in early 2020 they shared their \"frustration with some of the News Corp. and Fox coverage\" of climate change in a statement to The Daily Beast, noting \"the ongoing denial among the news outlets in Australia.\" After the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol in Washington, James indirectly criticized Fox News, saying that unnamed \"outlets that propagate lies to their audience\" had \"unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years.\"\n\nIn the spring of 2019, Mr. Murdoch's children -- including the two children he had with Ms. Deng -- received payouts of roughly $2 billion each from Murdoch's sale of his movie studios and other assets to the Walt Disney Company. James and Kathryn announced at the time that they would devote part of that fortune to causes like climate change and combating \"high-tech illiberalism.\"\n\nAccording to several of his associates, Mr. Murdoch has come to resent James's criticisms and complaints, given that the family empire, which Mr. Murdoch built almost single-handedly, has made James and his siblings multibillionaires. The court document indicates that Mr. Murdoch's representatives have referred to him in their own communications as the \"troublesome beneficiary.\"\n\nJames had differed with his father and brother over Fox News, arguing its play to Mr. Trump's for short-term ratings gains would undercut its parent company's long-term prospects, a fight he lost before parting ways with them.\n\nSince leaving the company, James has been managing his own portfolio of investments, with a controlling interest in the company that runs Art Basel and major stakes in media companies in India.\n\nIt has always been unclear how serious James was about trying to make any move against Lachlan, or if he would have the backing of his sisters for such an effort. The fact that they have come together to preserve the trust suggests that he and his sisters are now solidly aligned against Lachlan, and that they may well try to oust him, or at least try to influence the direction of the company, after their father's death.\n\nWhether they will have the legal power to do so will soon be determined in a courtroom in Reno.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com",

Instead, Murdoch wants to give it to his eldest son, the politically like-minded Lachlan, to maintain the organization's conservative bent and not ruin its market capitalization.\n\nTo achieve the family lockout, Murdoch sought to amend an irrevocable family trust that would have split control of the trust between the four heirs -- unless Murdoch could show how his plan to change it would benefit each child. The document obtained by the Times outlined a review of the case's facts by a probate commissioner, Edmund Gorman Jr. (Gorman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nWhy I Can Never Forgive Rupert Murdoch\n\nMurdoch argued to a Reno, Nevada, court that only Lachlan could maintain its current commercial value, thereby providing financial windfalls to each of his children, according to the Times. He was primarily concerned with the \"lack of consensus\" among the siblings, fearing it \"would impact the strategic direction at both companies including a potential reorientation of editorial policy and content.\"\n\nWilliam Barr, a former attorney general under George H.W.

A representative for Murdoch did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMurdoch has previously stated his desire for Lachlan -- who oversees the parent companies of Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, and the New York Post -- to succeed him. Lachlan's appointment to the top of Fox Corp. in 2019 following Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox was widely seen as an opportunity for the eldest son's ascension to the top of the empire.\n\nIt came a year before James Murdoch, often seen as the more liberal-leaning Murdoch child, criticized his family's editorial decisions before he resigned from the board of News Corp. over its right-wing tilt. \"My resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions,\" he wrote in his July 2020 resignation letter.\n\nWhile two of Murdoch's six children, Elisabeth and Prudence, have often stayed out of the family squabbles, the document obtained by the Times indicates they are aligned with James in protesting their father's decision. In the document, the three argue the move violates the trust and was not done in good faith.

The report comes from a 48-page decision by a Nevada probate commissioner that was originally filed under seal before being obtained by the Times.\n\nMurdoch is apparently worried about the more moderate-leaning views of his three other children and thinks Lachlan would best serve the conservative perspective advanced by Fox Corp. and News Corp.

According to the Times, the three think Murdoch is \"trying to disenfranchise them\" and that the move \"violates the spirit of the initial trust, enshrined in its 'equal governance provision,' and that it was not done in good faith.\"\n\nCurrently, the Murdoch trust gives equal power to his four oldest children. They'd get the same voting rights Murdoch's death. His hope is to adjust things so that Lachlan receives more power when it comes to company decision-making.

But last week it was Murdoch, 93, who travelled to Milwaukee to witness Donald Trump accept the Republican party's nomination for president, watching from a box in the arena.\n\nMurdoch watchers say the media baron had not been to a US political convention in decades, if ever. Some saw it as a conciliatory gesture towards Trump -- a man Murdoch has known for decades but never viewed as the best presidential material.\n\nOthers, including former executives, saw the trip as highlighting a more fundamental shift: Murdoch's diminished influence, not just over a Republican party that has been wholly remade in Trump's image, but across the other strongholds in his conservative media empire.\n\nDavid Folkenflik, author of Murdoch's World, said the mogul's appearance in Milwaukee was an act of \"obeisance\" to a politician who remains a huge draw to Murdoch's Fox News network. \"What we're really talking about here is Murdoch making peace with Trump as still the defining figure of the Republican party -- and therefore his audience.\"\n\nMurdoch may control the most profitable, powerful media voice on the American right. But nothing seemed to go his way in Milwaukee. Trump selected JD Vance as his running mate on the first day of the convention -- a pro-regulation, anti-Wall Street senator opposed by Murdoch, who preferred North Dakota governor Doug Burgum.\n\nThe Trump family then appeared to revel in ignoring his advice. \"There was a time where if you wanted to survive in the Republican party, you had to bend the knee to him or to others,\" Donald Trump Jr told a side event at the convention. \"I don't think that's the case any more.\" Fox declined to comment.\n\nMurdoch watched the main speakers seated in the convention hall among the Maga faithful while a man he fired last year -- the firebrand former Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, who now has his own YouTube channel -- took a seat alongside the former president.\n\nMurdoch, who has met US presidents going back to John F Kennedy, is not typically a man for the fringes. Over the past 40 years, the Australian press baron has acted as a powerbroker in the White House, Downing Street and Canberra, offering support and access to his Fox news outlets in the US, and an influential stable of print publications in Britain and Australia.\n\nGeordie Greig, editor-in-chief of The Independent and who has worked for Murdoch, said his \"influence and reach\" as a media mogul \"has been unsurpassed in the last 100 years\".\n\nMurdoch's titles have taken pride in backing winners, from Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, to Sir John Major in 1992 and most notably Labour's Tony Blair in 1997, an unexpected bedfellow for the conservative Murdochs.\n\nBut in the most recent UK election, Labour swept to power with only lukewarm support from his Sun tabloid newspaper, while The Times did not endorse the winner, Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nMurdoch, who got married to his fifth wife Elena Zhukova in May, is said by company insiders to have loosened his grip on the day-to-day operations of his news empire as it goes through a generational transition. In September last year, Murdoch said he would stand down as chair of both Fox and News Corp, leaving his eldest son, Lachlan, in charge.\n\nLachlan is now taking on a much more hands-on role in the sorts of decisions that his father once controlled. \"Rupert is definitely involved and interested in politics,\" said one company executive. \"But he has handed over to Lachlan.\"\n\nNews UK insiders say the younger Murdoch was in The Sun newsroom and was instrumental in its decision to back Labour. They also say Lachlan held meetings with Starmer in the run-up to the election, the sort of political engagements that were once the hallmark of his father.\n\nEven so, the low-key support for Labour is in stark contrast to the last time The Sun switched sides. Blair flew across the world to meet the magnate; Starmer was mostly interested that Murdoch's titles did not cause him trouble, those close to him said, rather than actively seeking endorsement.\n\nEven in the cradle of the Murdoch empire, his sway has begun to wane. Media analysts said it was notable that Australia's Labor party won power two years ago -- without the backing of Murdoch's outlets.\n\nTrump has arguably posed much bigger challenges -- and opportunities -- for Murdoch than any other politician in his career.\n\nStarting in the 1970s, Trump was a tabloid gold mine for Murdoch's New York Post. Murdoch was said to be reluctant to get behind his bid for the presidency in 2016; those qualms were eased as Trump provided stellar ratings for Fox.\n\nBut the network's support of Trump also cost it dearly: last year it agreed to pay nearly $800mn to settle a lawsuit brought by voting technology group Dominion, which accused Fox News of defamation after it aired false claims of election fraud in 2020.\n\nThe trial revealed caustic private messages about Trump between Fox executives, including an email from Murdoch urging them to \"make Trump a non person\" after the January 6 2021 riot in Washington.\n\nThe Post had a dismissive mention on its front page of Trump's 2022 decision to run again for the presidency -- \"Florida man makes announcement\" -- while headlining the full news story: \"Been There, Don That\".\n\nTrump meanwhile used his Truth Social platform to take shots at Murdoch and its outlets. The former president said if Murdoch and \"his group of MAGA Hating Globalist RINOS honestly believes that the Presidential Election of 2020, despite MASSIVE amounts of proof to the contrary, was not Rigged & Stolen\" then he \"should get out of the News Business as soon as possible\".\n\nEven if Trump is not the Murdoch's first choice, media analysts say Fox needs the Republican nominee, who carries overwhelming support among much of its audience. Fox News now faces challengers such as Newsmax as well as X, whose owner Elon Musk is a Trump supporter.\n\n\"Trump is no longer beholden to Murdoch's empire as he once was,\" said one former Murdoch staffer. \"There are viable [media] alternatives with younger demographics that mean more.\"\n\nFor decades, Fox had an iron grip on conservative viewers through cable TV. But Emily Bell of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism said the \"Maga right\" now had alternative ways to celebrate all things Trump.\n\n\"It no longer sees Fox News as essential,\" she said. \"The buildout of an entirely different media ecosystem that addresses the far right -- aided by Musk's control of X -- not only loosens Murdoch's grip but loosens Fox's grip too.\"\n\nFor now, though, Fox News remains by far the dominant news source in the US. It scored its highest weekend ratings ever following the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump, attracting 6.9mn viewers -- the most of any TV network. Its convention coverage drove the best ratings since the 2020 election.\n\nMurdoch's appearance at the RNC is also the latest sign that relations may be thawing as the election nears. Trump featured at a Fox town hall in January, and has appeared on or called into the channel since. His family and others in the Trump camp also regularly appear.\n\nFox executives say any strains between Trump and Murdoch have also been exaggerated, pointing to a podcast released this month in which the former president said: \"I speak with Rupert Murdoch a lot. He's as sharp as a tack.\"\n\nEven since the convention, Trump returned to his Fox-friendly posture by giving the network an endorsement in one of his first social media posts after President Joe Biden said he was dropping out of the race.\n\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on Fox News, rather than very biased [Disney-owned] ABC.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But Murdoch the elder is trying to change that by ensuring that Lachlan, the current CEO of Fox, would remain in charge, according to a story in the New York Times. That's created a rift with the other three siblings, who are trying to block him.\n\nPrudence is Murdoch's eldest daughter from his first wife, Patricia Booke. Lachlan, Elisabeth and James are his children from Anna Torv. Rupet Murdoch, 93, had two children with his third wife, Wendi Deng, who have an economic interest in the trust but no voting control.\n\nThe NYT says Murdoch is seeking the change to avoid infighting. He fears his more liberal leaning offspring might attempt to oust Lachlan and change the company's editorial direction. They could do that, with three votes to Lachlan's one. Rupert believes that would destroy the significant economic value that rests in Fox, and that retaining that value is in the best interest of all of his heirs.\n\nAccording to a probate document viewed by the Times, the process is underway. The trust is irrevocable but a Nevada probate commissioner found that there's a window for it to be altered it if Murdoch is acting in good faith and seeking change for the benefit of all heirs.\n\nHe says he is doing just that. His other three children disagree and have engaged Gary A. Bornstein, the co-head of litigation at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, to represent them. Only Lachlan attended Murdoch's recent wedding to his fifth wife in California.\n\nSo did Bill Barr, the times said, an attorney general under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Donald Trump, whom Murdoch recently appointed as one of his personal representatives on the trust, said the NYT.\n\nThe trust controls Fox News and Fox Television parent Fox Corp. and News Corp, which owns the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and other high profile publications in the UK and Australia.\n\nMORE", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Succession (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Torv", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anna Torv"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Barr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Corp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News Corp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cravath,_Swaine_&_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cravath, Swaine & Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George H.

But last week it was Murdoch (93), who travelled to Milwaukee to witness Donald Trump accept the Republican Party's nomination for president, watching from a box in the arena.\n\nMurdoch watchers say the media baron had not been to a US political convention in decades, if ever. Some saw it as a conciliatory gesture towards Trump - a man Murdoch has known for decades but never viewed as the best presidential material.\n\nOthers, including former executives, saw the trip as highlighting a more fundamental shift: Murdoch's diminished influence, not just over a Republican Party that has been wholly remade in Trump's image, but across the other strongholds in his conservative media empire.\n\nDavid Folkenflik, author of Murdoch's World, said the mogul's appearance in Milwaukee was an act of \"obeisance\" to a politician who remains a huge draw to Murdoch's Fox News network. \"What we're really talking about here is Murdoch making peace with Trump as still the defining figure of the Republican Party - and therefore his audience.\"\n\nMurdoch may control the most profitable, powerful media voice on the American right. But nothing seemed to go his way in Milwaukee. Trump selected JD Vance as his running mate on the first day of the convention - a pro-regulation, anti-Wall Street senator opposed by Murdoch, who preferred North Dakota governor Doug Burgum.\n\n[ The uneasy truce between Donald Trump and Fox NewsOpens in new window ]\n\nThe Trump family then appeared to revel in ignoring his advice. \"There was a time where if you wanted to survive in the Republican Party, you had to bend the knee to him or to others,\" Donald Trump Jr told a side event at the convention. \"I don't think that's the case any more.\" Fox declined to comment.\n\nMurdoch watched the main speakers seated in the convention hall among the Maga faithful while a man he fired last year - the firebrand former Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, who now has his own YouTube channel - took a seat alongside the former president.\n\nMurdoch, who has met US presidents going back to John F Kennedy, is not typically a man for the fringes. Over the past 40 years, the Australian press baron has acted as a power broker in the White House, Downing Street and Canberra, offering support and access to his Fox News outlets in the US, and an influential stable of print publications in Britain and Australia.\n\nGeordie Greig, editor-in-chief of the Independent and who has worked for Murdoch, said his \"influence and reach\" as a media mogul \"has been unsurpassed in the last 100 years\".\n\nMurdoch's titles have taken pride in backing winners, from Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, to John Major in 1992 and most notably Labour's Tony Blair in 1997, an unexpected bedfellow for the conservative Murdochs.\n\nBut in the most recent UK election, Labour swept to power with only lukewarm support from his Sun tabloid newspaper, while the Times did not endorse the winner, Keir Starmer.\n\nMurdoch, who got married to his fifth wife Elena Zhukova last month, is said by company insiders to have loosened his grip on the day-to-day operations of his news empire as it goes through a generational transition. In September last year, Murdoch said he would stand down as chair of both Fox and News Corp, leaving his eldest son, Lachlan, in charge.\n\nLachlan is now taking on a much more hands-on role in the sorts of decisions that his father once controlled. \"Rupert is definitely involved and interested in politics,\" said one company executive. \"But he has handed over to Lachlan.\"\n\nNews UK insiders say the younger Murdoch was in the Sun newsroom and was instrumental in its decision to back Labour. They also say Lachlan held meetings with Starmer in the run-up to the election, the sort of political engagements that were once the hallmark of his father.\n\nEven so, the low-key support for Labour is in stark contrast to the last time the Sun switched sides. Blair flew across the world to meet the magnate; Starmer was mostly interested that Murdoch's titles did not cause him trouble, those close to him said, rather than actively seeking endorsement.\n\nEven in the cradle of the Murdoch empire, his sway has begun to wane. Media analysts said it was notable that Australia's Labor Party won power two years ago - without the backing of Murdoch's outlets.\n\n[ Fox News accused of imposing 'soft ban' on Donald TrumpOpens in new window ]\n\nTrump has arguably posed much bigger challenges - and opportunities - for Murdoch than any other politician in his career.\n\nStarting in the 1970s, Trump was a tabloid gold mine for Murdoch's New York Post. Murdoch was said to be reluctant to get behind his bid for the presidency in 2016; those qualms were eased as Trump provided stellar ratings for Fox.\n\nBut the network's support of Trump also cost it dearly: last year it agreed to pay nearly $800 million to settle a lawsuit brought by voting technology group Dominion, which accused Fox News of defamation after it aired false claims of election fraud in 2020.\n\nThe trial revealed caustic private messages about Trump between Fox executives, including an email from Murdoch urging them to \"make Trump a non person\" after the January 6th, 2021 riot in Washington.\n\nThe Post had a dismissive mention on its front page of Trump's 2022 decision to run again for the presidency - \"Florida man makes announcement\" - while headlining the full news story: \"Been There, Don That\".\n\nTrump meanwhile used his Truth Social platform to take shots at Murdoch and its outlets. The former president said if Murdoch and \"his group of MAGA Hating Globalist RINOS [Republicans in Name Only] honestly believes that the Presidential Election of 2020, despite MASSIVE amounts of proof to the contrary, was not Rigged & Stolen\" then he \"should get out of the News Business as soon as possible\".\n\nEven if Trump is not the Murdoch's first choice, media analysts say Fox needs the Republican nominee, who carries overwhelming support among much of its audience. Fox News now faces challengers such as Newsmax as well as X, whose owner Elon Musk is a Trump supporter.\n\n\"Trump is no longer beholden to Murdoch's empire as he once was,\" said one former Murdoch staffer. \"There are viable [media] alternatives with younger demographics that mean more.\"\n\nFor decades, Fox had an iron grip on conservative viewers through cable TV. But Emily Bell of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism said the \"Maga right\" now had alternative ways to celebrate all things Trump.\n\n\"It no longer sees Fox News as essential,\" she said. \"The buildout of an entirely different media ecosystem that addresses the far right - aided by Musk's control of X - not only loosens Murdoch's grip but loosens Fox's grip too.\"\n\nFor now, though, Fox News remains by far the dominant news source in the US. It scored its highest weekend ratings ever following the July 13th assassination attempt on Trump, attracting 6.9 million viewers - the most of any TV network. Its convention coverage drove the best ratings since the 2020 election.\n\nMurdoch's appearance at the Republican National Convention is also the latest sign that relations may be thawing as the election nears. Trump featured at a Fox town hall in January, and has appeared on or called into the channel since. His family and others in the Trump camp also regularly appear.\n\nAny strains between Trump and Murdoch have also been exaggerated, others say, pointing to a podcast released this month in which the former president said: \"I speak with Rupert Murdoch a lot. He's as sharp as a tack.\"\n\nEven since the convention, Trump returned to his Fox-friendly posture by giving the network an endorsement in one of his first social media posts after President Joe Biden said he was dropping out of the race.\n\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on Fox News, rather than very biased [Disney-owned] ABC.\" -

But last week, it was Murdoch, 93, who traveled to Milwaukee to watch Donald Trump's Republican inauguration from a box in the arena.\n\nObservers said the media baron had not attended a US political convention in decades, if ever. Some saw it as a conciliatory gesture toward Trump, a man Murdoch has known for many years but never considered the best candidate for a presidential office.\n\nOthers, including former leaders, saw the trip as a sign of a more fundamental shift: Murdoch's diminishing influence, not only over a Republican Party reshaped in Trump's image, but also over other bastions of his conservative media empire.\n\nDavid Folkenflik, author of Murdoch's World, said the mogul's presence in Milwaukee was an act of obeisance to a politician who remains a major draw for Murdoch's Fox News network. What we're really talking about here is Murdoch's reconciliation with Trump, who remains the defining figure of the Republican Party and therefore its audience.\n\nMurdoch may control the most profitable and powerful media voice on the American right. But nothing seems to be going his way in Milwaukee. Trump chose J.D. Vance as his running mate on the first day of the convention, a pro-regulation, anti-Wall Street senator who opposed Murdoch, who preferred North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nThe Trump family then seemed happy to ignore his advice. There was a time when the way to survive in the Republican Party was to bend the knee to him or to others, Donald Trump Jr. said at a side event at the convention. I don't think that's the case today. Fox declined to comment.\n\nMurdoch watched as keynote speakers sat in the convention hall among Maga loyalists as a man he fired last year, former Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, who now has his own YouTube channel, took a seat next to the former president.\n\nDonald Trump, left, speaks to Tucker Carlson at the Republican convention last week Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nMurdoch, who has met with US presidents since John F. Kennedy, is no man of the margins. For the past 40 years, the Australian-born media magnate has played a power broker role in the White House, Downing Street and Canberra, lending support and access to his Fox News outlet in the US, as well as an influential suite of print publications in Britain and Australia.\n\nGeordie Greig, editor of The Independent who worked for Murdoch, said his influence and reach as a media mogul was unmatched in the last 100 years.\n\nMurdoch's titles have been proud to back winners, from Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, to Sir John Major in 1992 and especially Labour's Tony Blair in 1997, an unlikely bedfellow for Murdoch's conservatives.\n\nBut in the last British election, Labour came to power with lukewarm support from its Sun tabloid, while The Times did not back the winner, Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nMurdoch, who married his fifth wife Elena Zhukova in June, has reportedly been loosening his grip on the day-to-day operations of his media empire as it undergoes a generational transition, according to sources close to the company. Last September, Murdoch said he would step down as chairman of Fox and News Corp, leaving his eldest son, Lachlan, in charge.\n\nLachlan now plays a much more active role in the decisions his father once controlled. Rupert is certainly involved and interested in politics, one company executive said. But he has given way to Lachlan.\n\nProtesters outside the High Court in central London in 2012, where Rupert Murdoch was giving evidence as part of an inquiry into media ethics. Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAccording to sources close to the newspaper, the younger Murdoch worked on the Sun's editorial staff and was instrumental in its decision to support Labour. They also claim that Lachlan held meetings with Starmer in the run-up to the election, the kind of political engagements that were once his father's trademark.\n\nStill, the quiet support for Labour stands in stark contrast to the last time the Sun switched sides. Blair flew around the world to meet the tycoon; Starmer was more interested in keeping Murdoch's credentials out of trouble, his insiders say, than actively seeking support.\n\nEven in the cradle of the Murdoch empire, his influence has begun to wane. Media analysts have noted that it is remarkable that the Australian Labor Party came to power two years ago without the support of Murdoch's media.\n\nTrump has arguably presented Murdoch with greater challenges and opportunities than any other politician in his career.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, Trump was a goldmine for Murdoch's New York Post. Murdoch was said to be reluctant to support his 2016 presidential bid; those reservations were eased when Trump delivered bumper ratings to Fox.\n\nRupert Murdoch with Ivanka Trump in Trump Tower in 2016 AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut the networks' support for Trump has also cost them dearly: Last year, they agreed to pay nearly $800 million to settle a lawsuit brought by voting technology group Dominion, which accused Fox News of defamation after it aired false claims of election fraud in 2020.\n\nThe trial revealed caustic private messages about Trump between Fox executives, including an email from Murdoch urging them to make Trump a non-person after the January 6, 2021, riot in Washington.\n\nThe Post made a dismissive mention on its front page of Trump's decision to run again for president in 2022.

The former president said that if Murdoch and his group of RINOS, MAGA-hating globalists, honestly believe that the 2020 presidential election, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, was not rigged and stolen, then he should leave the news business as soon as possible.\n\nEven though Trump is not Murdoch's first choice, media analysts say Fox News needs the Republican candidate, who has overwhelming support among much of its audience.

Rupert has called it \"Project Harmony\" -- the reality is anything but. And all just in time for The Australian's 60th birthday party tonight, set to be hosted by Lachlan.\n\nThe bombshell story was broken by the Times' crack team of Jim Rutenberg and Jonathan Mahler, who co-authored the landmark \"Planet Fox\" investigation five years ago and who are well sourced on the Murdoch family.\n\nThe Times has obtained a copy of a sealed, 48-page decision by the Nevada probate commissioner, ahead of a hearing in September that will decide whether Murdoch's attempt will be successful. Although the Murdoch Family Trust is irrevocable, it can be amended if it is in the interest of all members.\n\nAccording to the story, Rupert -- who finally retired from the boards of Fox and News last year, formally handing the reins at both Fox and News to his eldest son Lachlan -- has petitioned the commissioner to amend the family trust so that the three other children from his first two marriages -- Prudence, Elisabeth and James -- are unable to challenge their brother's control of the media empire or moderate the conservative editorial line taken at the Murdoch media businesses including Fox News.\n\nRupert Murdoch is arguing that any attempt to challenge Lachlan's control of Fox and News, or to soften its conservative editorial stance, would reduce the value of those businesses, particularly Fox News, the dominant cable news channel in America which is pitched to the MAGA audience fanatically loyal to Donald Trump, and has been crushing its competitors in ratings through an unprecedented, tumultuous election cycle ahead of November's ballot.\n\nAs the eldest son and CEO of Fox Corporation, anointed as successor by Rupert and the board after the sale of the bulk of the former 21 Century Fox to Disney in 2019, Lachlan has stuck dutifully to the centre-right conservative formula devised by his father and the late Roger Ailes, who co-founded Fox News in 1996. That's led to a deepening division with his younger brother James, who was appalled by the Trump administration. James has had no role at Fox since the Disney sale and quit the board of News in 2020.\n\nIt is understood the two brothers have not spoken since, leaving the two sisters Prudence and Elisabeth holding the balance of power on the Murdoch Family Trust, which gives the four siblings an equal say. According to Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff, author of The Fall, Prudence is disinclined to upset any majority that emerges between her three younger siblings, who have all worked extensively for the family business. That leaves Elisabeth, eldest child of Anna Murdoch, as the swing vote in a dispute between Lachlan and James -- she has tried to be a peacemaker and has often been described as \"Switzerland\".\n\nThe key terms of the irrevocable trust were established during Rupert's 1998/99 divorce from Anna, who could potentially have sued for half the media empire after 31 years of marriage. Anna sought to ensure that her children's control of the Murdoch media empire could not be challenged by any future children born to Rupert's third wife, Wendi Deng. Rupert and Wendi had two daughters, Chloe and Grace, and when they were born Rupert did try to amend the trust to ensure his children would be treated equally. That caused huge upset among his older children, who felt that Anna had left billions on the table to protect their inheritance.\n\nA solution of sorts was found in 2006 when it was agreed that the six children would be treated equally financially, but only the four eldest children would have voting shares of the trust. Rupert has four votes while his four older children have one each -- which means he and Lachlan have unquestioned control until he dies, at which point his votes effectively expire. That sets up an instability in the structure of the Murdoch empire.\n\nAs the relationship between Lachlan and James deteriorated after the Disney sale was agreed, Rutenberg and Mahler reported that Rupert had backed a plan for Lachlan to buy out his siblings' shares of the trust. Documents were drawn up according to the Times, but Lachlan baulked. As I wrote in my unauthorised biography, The Successor, Lachlan saw no reason to borrow heavily to buy something he already had: control.\n\nWhen researching the biography, I was guided by sources familiar with the dynamic inside the Murdoch family that indicated Lachlan's three elder siblings were no longer interested in selling, but were determined to assert control over all of the Murdoch media businesses, and to do it in a way that enhanced democracies around the world rather than undermined them. Those lines caught the attention of the world's media afficionados, sparking headlines from Vanity Fair to The Guardian, Bloomberg to the Financial Times.\n\nIn Lachlan's camp, such fevered speculation was dismissed as fanciful, but today's revelations show fears of just such a move by the three elder Murdoch siblings are very real and shared by Rupert himself. To my observation, over years of reporting, Murdoch family time is often six to 12 months ahead of the news cycle, and in retrospect it is clear that the petition to amend the family trust, filed quietly last September, was part of a larger strategy which included Rupert's very public retirement announcement -- both were designed to entrench Lachlan's succession and ensure Rupert's conservative political legacy.\n\nRupert's attempt to amend the trust once again has alienated Prudence, Elisabeth and James -- so much so that they were not present at his fifth wedding, to Elena Zhukova, 67, at his moorage vineyard last month. Of his older children, only Lachlan was there.\n\nWhatever way the Nevada probate commissioner rules after the week-long trial in September -- it is understood that the court hearings will be closed, and a decision may not be known for weeks or months -- the action by Rupert underlines that no matter Lachlan's achievements as CEO and successor, his position remains vulnerable.\n\nI can't read Lachlan's mind but in my opinion his decision, with his wife Sarah, to call Australia \"home\" despite his heavy managerial responsibilities in the US is one way of telling the boards of Fox and News, shareholders and the rest of the world that he can take or leave the succession -- even as behind the scenes he and his father are fighting to protect it.\n\nAs he heads off to celebrate the 60th anniversary of The Australian tonight -- it is understood everyone from the prime minister down will be attending -- the succession question, supposedly resolved, will again be swirling around him, as it has most days for the past 30 years.\n\nWhat do you make of the latest Murdoch family drama?

But a Succession-like intrafamily battle is playing out among Murdoch's eldest children. Three of Murdoch's eldest children are fighting to maintain control over the media empire, per the New York Times.\n\nAn intrafamily battle that could have been pulled straight out of the page of Jesse Armstrong's \"Succession\" has been playing out behind the scenes for the future of Rupert Murdoch's vast media empire.\n\nRupert Murdoch announced last September that he was stepping down as chairman of Fox and News Corp. -- which includes Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Post, among other publications -- entrusting his elder son Lachlan Murdoch to the helm.\n\nThe anointing of Lachlan over his other three elder children -- James, Elisabeth, and Prudence -- seemed to answer decadeslong speculation over which of the Murdochs will lead the future of the right-leaning media conglomerates once Rupert, now 93 years old, dies.\n\nLachlan, who is sometimes seen as a parallel to Roman Roy, as Business Insider's Madeline Berg reported, would likely preserve the political leanings of the media empire once he takes over.\n\nBut the family infighting appears to be anything but settled.\n\nA sealed court document viewed by The New York Times indicated that a legal battle has been quietly playing out in Reno, Nevada, over the control of Fox and News Corp., pitting James, Elisabeth, and Prudence against their father.\n\nAccording to the Times, citing court documents, Murdoch is attempting to rewrite the family trust, which originally gave his four oldest children equal input over his media empire, in order to give Lachlan total control.\n\nMurdoch is arguing in court that he is making the change, to what is largely an irrevocable trust, in good faith to protect the value of his companies for the benefit of his children, the Times reported. A small stipulation in the trust allows for changes as long as all of the mentioned heirs will benefit, according to the Times report.\n\nA Nevada probate commissioner determined that Murdoch could make the changes if he can prove that he is acting in good faith, according to documents seen by the Times. A trial is scheduled for September, according to the Times.\n\nAlthough the children's ownership stake will not be impacted by Murdoch's changes, the new version of the trust would increase Lachlan's voting powers for Fox and News Corp. so that he can't be challenged by his siblings, according to the court documents seen by the Times.\n\nJames, Elisabeth, and Prudence, who are being represented by the same legal counsel, are arguing that the move violates the \"equal governance provision\" stipulated in the trust and are determined to maintain control of their father's companies, the Times reported.\n\nAttorneys for Murdoch and his three elder children did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMurdoch's decision to give Lachlan control of his media empire has left the patriarch estranged from his three eldest children, according to the Times.\n\nNone of the three children attended Murdoch's wedding to Elena Zhukova in June at his California vineyard, according to the Times report.\n\nOver the years, the family had already seemed to exhibit rifts stemming from Murdoch's news companies.\n\nMost notably, James, a climate activist, who once appeared to be the leading contender to take over the media empire, has publicly bristled at Fox News' coverage and embrace of Donald Trump.\n\n\"There are views I really disagree with on Fox,\" James told The New Yorker in 2019, about a year before he left his seat on the News Corp. board of directors.\n\n\"My resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions,\" the son wrote in his brief letter of resignation.\n\nElisabeth and Prudence, however, have made it a point to distance themselves from the family business. Elisabeth left the media empire years ago in 2000, while Prudence is said to be the least involved in the business.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lloyd_lee@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Lloyd Lee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachlan_Murdoch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lachlan Murdoch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rupert Murdoch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Corp", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "News Corp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Succession (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murdoch_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murdoch family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_conglomerate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Media conglomerate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reno, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Reno, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patriarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/66a19649fb2b6bedb05a59a3.jpg?ver=1721872899", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758261", "eventUri": "eng-9758261", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

However, the 93-year-old has sought to change the terms so that Lachlan assumes sole control.\n\nThe family trust is \"irrevocable\". However, it is said to contain a provision allowing for changes to be done in good faith if they have the sole purpose of benefiting all of the beneficiaries.\n\nMr Mudoch sought to change the terms late last year, according to the New York Times, and last month the Nevada probate commissioner reportedly ruled that he could amend the trust if he could show he was acting in good faith and for the sole benefit of his heirs. Nevada is a popular US state for family trusts because of favourable laws and privacy protections.\n\nMr Murdoch's lawyers have reportedly said they are trying to protect James, Elisabeth and Prudence, arguing that divided control could undermine the health of the business and damage their inheritance. The issue will reportedly go to trial in September to determine whether Mr Murdoch is indeed acting in good faith.\n\nUnder the terms of current trust, Mr Murdoch cannot be outvoted, according to the New York Times. The patriarch reportedly wants to establish a similar arrangement for Lachlan. It is understood that the changes wouldn't affect ownership stakes.\n\nThe rationale is that a \"lack of consensus\" among the children \"would impact the strategic direction at both companies including a potential reorientation of editorial policy and content\", according to court papers seen by The New York Times.\n\nA spokesman for News UK declined to comment. A representative of the Murdoch family was contacted for comment. Both sides declined to comment to the New York Times.\n\nThe dispute echoes the power struggles depicted in Succession, the TV show that was closely inspired by the life of the Murdochs as well as other media dynasties.\n\nLachlan, 52, has been positioned as his father's heir apparent in recent years after assuming the role of chief executive and chairman of TV group Fox Corporation in 2019 and chairman of News Corp last year. News Corp controls newspapers in the US, UK and Australia, including The Times, The Sun and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMr Murdoch has always sought to position one of his children to take over the running of his media empire, with Elisabeth and James seen as potential candidates at various times.\n\nHowever, both have drifted away from the family business over the years. Elisabeth, 55, left her father's British TV business BSkyB in 2000 and today runs a film studio. James, 51, was an executive at Fox until 2019.\n\nBoth have more liberal politics than their father. James and his wife issued a rare public statement criticising his father's newspapers and TV channels for the way they covered climate change in 2020. Elisabeth hosted a fundraiser for Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nMr Murdoch has for decades been a kingmaker in conservative politics across the English-speaking world and was pictured at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last week.\n\nThe Australian-born billionaire has been married five times and has six children. He had Prudence Murdoch with his first wife, Patricia Booker, while Elisabeth, Lachlan and James were the product of his second, and longest, marriage to Anna Torv. He had two children with his third wife, Wendi Deng.\n\nThe media tycoon tied the knot for the fifth time in June, wedding Moscow-born Elena Zhukova at a Californian vineyard.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nThe anointing of Lachlan over his other three elder children -- James, Elisabeth, and Prudence -- seemed to answer decadeslong speculation over which of the Murdochs will lead the future of the right-leaning media conglomerates once Rupert, now 93 years old, dies.\n\nLachlan, who is sometimes seen as a parallel to Roman Roy, as Business Insider's Madeline Berg reported, would likely preserve the political leanings of the media empire once he takes over.\n\nBut the family infighting appears to be anything but settled.\n\nA sealed court document viewed by The New York Times indicated that a legal battle has been quietly playing out in Reno, Nevada, over the control of Fox and News Corp., pitting James, Elisabeth, and Prudence against their father.\n\nAccording to the Times, citing court documents, Murdoch is attempting to rewrite the family trust, which originally gave his four oldest children equal input over his media empire, in order to give Lachlan total control.\n\nMurdoch is arguing in court that he is making the change, to what is largely an irrevocable trust, in good faith to protect the value of his companies for the benefit of his children, the Times reported. A small stipulation in the trust allows for changes as long as all of the mentioned heirs will benefit, according to the Times report.\n\nA Nevada probate commissioner determined that Murdoch could make the changes if he can prove that he is acting in good faith, according to documents seen by the Times. A trial is scheduled for September, according to the Times.\n\nAlthough the children's ownership stake will not be impacted by Murdoch's changes, the new version of the trust would increase Lachlan's voting powers for Fox and News Corp. so that he can't be challenged by his siblings, according to the court documents seen by the Times.\n\nJames, Elisabeth, and Prudence, who are being represented by the same legal counsel, are arguing that the move violates the \"equal governance provision\" stipulated in the trust and are determined to maintain control of their father's companies, the Times reported.\n\nAttorneys for Murdoch and his three elder children did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMurdoch's decision to give Lachlan control of his media empire has left the patriarch estranged from his three eldest children, according to the Times.\n\nNone of the three children attended Murdoch's wedding to Elena Zhukova in June at his California vineyard, according to the Times report.\n\nOver the years, the family had already seemed to exhibit rifts stemming from Murdoch's news companies.\n\nMost notably, James, a climate activist, who once appeared to be the leading contender to take over the media empire, has publicly bristled at Fox News' coverage and embrace of Donald Trump.\n\n\"There are views I really disagree with on Fox,\" James told The New Yorker in 2019, about a year before he left his seat on the News Corp. board of directors.\n\n\"My resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions,\" the son wrote in his brief letter of resignation.\n\nElisabeth and Prudence, however, have made it a point to distance themselves from the family business. Elisabeth left the media empire years ago in 2000, while Prudence is said to be the least involved in the business.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lloyd_lee@businessinsider.com", "name": "Lloyd Lee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Corp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News Corp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murdoch_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murdoch family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_conglomerate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Media conglomerate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Good faith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reno, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Reno, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patriarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vineyard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vineyard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66a19661fb2b6bedb05a59ae?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758261", "eventUri": "eng-9758261", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Those dark arts now include a legal battle against three of his own children, in public.\n\nThis article is an instalment in a series, Project Harmony, on Rupert Murdoch's secret plan threatening to blow up his family.\n\nWhen I decided to write a book about media moguls and their abuse of power -- it's called The Men Who Killed the News and is published next week -- I thought this was a largely completed story about a largely faded era.\n\nToday, that assumption was turned on its ear by the revelation in The New York Times that Rupert Murdoch is taking three of his children to court to attempt to prevent them from taking over his media empire when (or if) he dies.\n\nDespite the existence of an \"irrevocable\" family agreement that hands legal control to his four eldest children when he enters the great newsroom in the sky, Murdoch has now decided he wants only one of those children -- Lachlan -- to run the family business and preserve its editorial excellence. He is taking the other three to court to try to unwind the agreement and boot them out.\n\nAt 93, and still meddling relentlessly in the democracies of the US, UK and Australia, Murdoch has been, still is, the most incorrigible manipulator of power in the long history of media moguldom. Robert Maxwell died mysteriously at sea; Conrad Black landed in jail; Beaverbrook orchestrated a king's abdication; Rothermere and Hearst promoted Hitler for a decade, Elon Musk trashes Twitter for ideological purposes.\n\nBut Rupert Murdoch remains the mogul's mogul, a brutal practitioner of the darkest arts of making money at all costs by exploiting the trust placed in journalism by democratic societies -- the \"loophole in democracy\" as I describe it in my book.\n\nThose dark arts now include an ensuing legal battle against three of his children, in public, in order to ensure that Lachlan keeps control of News Corp and Fox News to protect \"the strategic direction at both companies including a potential reorientation of editorial policy and content\", as the NYT quotes the court's decision in a case now unfolding in a Nevada court.\n\nAll this would merely be gossip fodder, a Succession-style soap opera, were it not for the civic consequences of the pollution of three great democracies by the 100-year Murdoch dynasty. A dynasty that began with Rupert's father, Keith, and is being manipulated in a US court to continue with his chosen son, Lachlan.\n\nIt was Keith Murdoch who set the template that, a century later, is perpetuated and enhanced by the faux journalism of Fox News and other parts of the News Corp empire. It was a template captured in a scene during a meeting with then Australian prime minister Joseph Lyons in Keith Murdoch's office in the 1930s that was witnessed and later described by a former Melbourne Herald copyboy who served his boss tea:\n\nMurdoch was still shouting and JA Lyons was standing before the desk. I put the tea down on the big desk and went out through the door. As I went through it I turned and there, with his hat in his hand, like a man seeking a job, stood the prime minister before Murdoch's desk. As I shut the door, I heard the leader of the nation say: 'Yes, sir.'\n\nThe Men Who Killed the News by Eric Beecher, published by Scribner, is available at all bookshops from July 31.\n\nWhat does Rupert's secret plan say about media consolidation?

The upcoming season will feature the Canadian procedural's milestone 300th episode The series boasts Canadian talent and notable guest stars, with Season 22 even featuring a musical episode.\n\nIt's almost time for fans to see Detective William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) return with more cases in the eighteenth season of Murdoch Mysteries, but this time, he will have some help from a new addition to the show. Per TV Insider, Paul Sun-Hyung Lee, known for starring in The Mandalorian and Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender, has joined Station House 4 as Inspector Albert Choi, providing a helping hand to Detective Murdoch while also bringing an entirely new point of view. The series markes a return to the CBC for Lee, who previously starred in the hit comedy series Kim's Convenience.\n\nProduction on Murdoch Mysteries Season 18 has already begun in Toronto, with the installment containing 22 episodes, including the show's milestone 300th episode. The series is based on characters from Maureen Jennings's Detective Murdoch novels and stars Bisson alongside H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy as Dr. Julia Ogden, Thomas Craig as Inspector Brackenried, Jonny Harris as Constable George Crabtree, Daniel Maslany as Detective Watts and Lachlan Murdoch as Constable Henry Higgens. It's also a \"who's who\" of Canadian talent, and has featured many notable guest stars -- Canadian and otherwise -- including William Shatner, Margaret Atwood, Geddy Lee, Chris Hadfield, Ed Asner and Nick Nurse. Season 22 also featured the show's first musical episode, \"Why Is Everybody Singing,\" which aired last spring.\n\nBeing featured in the CBC period drama is unlike anything Lee has ever done before, which he admits while also praising the series, saying:\n\n\"It's a lot of fun stepping back in time, and I don't think I've ever done a period piece like this before. It's a show that remains innovative, that is family-friendly as well, and a little bit on the edge, and it's one of those shows that, although it is a procedural, it does sort of keep you on your toes in terms of trying to figure out whodunnit, as it were, and yeah, that's a recipe for success.\"\n\n'Murdoch Mysteries' Season 18 Has Many \"Murdochian\" Thrills!\n\nExecutive producer Peter Mitchell also shared his excitement for Lee to join the series, saying:\n\n\"We are delighted that Paul has joined us in the world of Murdoch. Paul brings a wealth of experience to his role as Inspector Albert Choi and we think the fans will really enjoy seeing him on the team at Station House 4.\"\n\nLike every season of Murdoch Mysteries, the upcoming one will feature lots of \"Murdochian\" thrills, including a murder at a Charles Dickens convention. Furthermore, viewers will see Detective Murdoch act as a bodyguard for a silent film star (Siobhan Murphy) and get thrown into a cinematic adventure himself. Several episodes will also focus on mysteries in the social issues of the show's era, including a worker's strike at a factory, a case of low-income housing, competing public hydro projects, and immigrants trying to procure land in the wilds of Canada.\n\nMurdoch Mysteries CrimeDramaMystery\n\nIn the 1890s, William Murdoch uses radical forensic techniques for the time, including

But what else are the Murdoch kids fighting over?\n\nThis article is an instalment in a series, Project Harmony, on Rupert Murdoch's secret plan threatening to blow up his family.\n\nRupert Murdoch has blown apart his family as he attempts to entrench son Lachlan as his inheritor and deny his other children a role in the future affairs of the empire. So let's review some of the assets up for grabs at the centre of \"Project Harmony\".\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Rupert Murdoch is attempting to give his eldest son Lachlan \"permanent, exclusive control\" over the family business, including Fox News, which is part of one of the two family companies, Fox Corp. The other is News Corp, also US based.\n\nThe Times report says Rupert is attempting to make changes to the family trust in a probate court in Reno, Nevada.\n\nRupert and Lachlan have not made any filing or statement on the case, even though the outcome will affect both Fox Corp and News Corp, the two companies the trust controls with around 40% of the voting shares.\n\nFox Corp is the key asset because of Fox News and its strong position as the right-wing publicity machine for the likes of Donald Trump.\n\nIn 2023, Rupert and Lachlan presided over one of the biggest defamation payouts in history -- a US$787 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems over lies Fox News put to air concerning the voting systems company's electronic machines and their role in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAnother voting machines company, Smartmatic, has a larger case against Fox that is due to go to trial soon in New York. Rupert and Lachlan have central roles in that case as well.\n\nNews Corp houses operations in the US (the New York Post, The Wall Street Journal and information businesses), the UK (The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times, and poorly run TV and radio companies) and Australia (The Australian, Sky News (about to change its name), and tabloids in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Hobart, as well as Harper Collins, 61% of REA Group, and 65% of Foxtel).\n\nThe trust also controls around 4% of Disney, making it the second biggest shareholder.\n\nWhile he is alive, Rupert has four votes in the trust while his four oldest children -- Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James -- have one each.\n\nReuters reported last year that upon Rupert's death, News Corp and Fox Corp voting shares will be transferred to his four oldest children, \"creating a scenario in which three of the children could out-vote a fourth, potentially setting up a battle over the future of the companies, even as Lachlan Murdoch runs Fox Corp and is the sole chair of News Corp\".\n\nIt is this provision that Rupert Murdoch is trying to undo, according to The New York Times.\n\nRupert knows that James, Prudence and Elisabeth do not especially like Fox News (or their brother Lachlan for that matter).\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, the trust also includes the Cruden family farm near Melbourne, and Rupert's art collection.", "source": {"uri": "crikey.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crikey"}, "authors": [{"uri": "glenn_dyer@crikey.com.au", "name": "Glenn Dyer", "type": "author",

But according to the NYT, Murdoch the elder is \"arguing in court that only by empowering Lachlan to run the company without interference from his more politically moderate siblings can he preserve its conservative editorial bent, and thus protect its commercial value for all his heirs\".\n\nRupert has reportedly dubbed these moves -- which have caught James, Elisabeth and Prudence completely off guard and resulted in them lawyering up to collectively fight them -- \"Project Harmony\", surely the best instance of newspeak this side of the Minitrue.\n\nSo how did we get here, and why are the kids other than Lachlan on the outs?\n\nJames is the youngest of Murdoch's sons, and he's always been a little different. In the 1990s, he dropped out of Harvard and helped establish the seminal hip-hop label Rawkus Records, which helped bring luminaries like Yasiin Bey (then Mos Def), Talib Kweli, Eminem and Hi-Tek to a wider audience.\n\nAt the time, Murdoch was a collection of classic '90s hipster tropes: tattoos, pierced ears and eyebrow, dyed hair and a goatee, and (he truly is his father's son) having a poster of Chairman Mao on his wall in New York. He was a keen cartoonist for both the Harvard Lampoon and Gear. Rawkus' stable of rappers attracted widespread critical acclaim, but in 1996 it needed a News Corp bailout (without question the company's greatest legacy, in this correspondent's view) and was bought by the company in 1998.\n\nAs Stephen Mayne noted in these pages in early 2020, once back in the family business James \"preferred to run his own race in far-flung parts of the empire, such as Hong Kong and London, well away from his father and older brother Lachlan\".\n\nHe was committed enough to bear a large portion of the brunt during the 2011 parliamentary committee investigating the phone-hacking at News Corp's UK tabloids, famously copping the sobriquet \"the only mafia boss in history who didn't know he was running a criminal enterprise\", from Labour's Tom Watson.\n\nSince then, the Murdoch siblings have repeatedly clashed over the political direction of News Corp's media empire. Sometimes this was subtle: In 2014, James and his wife founded Quadrivium, a foundation that describes its mission as investing in \"root cause solutions for some of society's most urgent challenges\", challenges such as climate change, democracy and scientific understanding. This pre-dated the company's lusty embrace of the conspiracy theories that helped justify an attempted coup in the US, but was after News Corp had employed some of the world's loudest and most prolific climate change deniers.\n\nAs with basically everyone in the world, the political differences between James and Lachlan became more febrile and extreme during the Trump era: when Trump announced his Muslim travel ban in 2017, James wanted to send a company-wide memo reassuring News' Muslim staff. This was significantly resisted and watered down, in a process he privately complained was like \"pulling teeth\". And when Trump described both sides of the lethal 2017 Charlottesville neo-Nazi rally as having \"some very fine people\", James went so far as to put out a personal statement in response.\n\nHis reward was to be all but erased from the 2018 announcement of the Fox restructure that would follow the deal the company struck with Disney to sell off its entertainment assets. Once that deal was complete in 2019, James officially quit the Fox Corporation but remained a board member on the separately listed News Corporation. In January 2020, as News Corp tried to blame the fires ravaging Australia on arson and \"green tape\" measures rather than climate change, a spokesperson told The Daily Beast: \"[James' wife] Kathryn and James' views on climate are well established and their frustration with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage of the topic is also well known\". (Though it might not be well known to anyone who got their information solely from News Corp.)\n\nBy July 2020, James' slow withdrawal from News Corp was complete, a move he explained as being down \"to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions\". Those disagreements only got worse -- though they didn't name names, a few weeks after the madness of January 6, James and Kathryn issued another statement with unmistakable intent:\n\nSpreading disinformation -- whether about the election, public health, or climate change -- has real world consequences. Many media property owners have as much responsibility for this as the elected officials who know the truth but choose instead to propagate lies.\n\nThe NYT describes Elisabeth as the \"Switzerland\" of the kids, apparently able to maintain cordial relationships with everyone. Like James, she has struck out on her own, and, like James, such independence doesn't preclude receiving hundreds of millions from dad's businesses.\n\nElisabeth had great success building the Shine TV production house, producing hits like The Biggest Loser and Merlin. It was so successful that it was worth just over a billion Australian dollars when it was purchased in 2014... by News Corp.\n\nThere have been moments of implied frost between Elisabeth and the family -- she was apparently absent at the 20th anniversary celebrations of Lachlan's marriage to Sarah, and she, James and Prudence didn't attend Rupert's fifth wedding last month. But it's never prompted her to speak out -- in anything other than the most subtle terms, if at all -- about the impact of News Corp's use of its power.\n\nRupert's eldest child is his most private, and, according to Vanity Fair, the only one \"not directly competing for his business affections\".\n\nPrudence reportedly had a tumultuous relationship with her mother -- Rupert's first wife, Patricia Brooker -- and her stepmother Anna Maria Torv (James, Elisabeth and Lachlan's mother), but hasn't publicly fallen out with the old man until now.\n\nA multi-billionaire who has held several roles within the News Corp over the years, most recently on the board of Times Newspapers, Ltd, she is more likely to make the news for huge real estate windfalls than any views she may have on the climate or the future of democracy.", "source": {"uri": "crikey.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crikey"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlie_lewis@crikey.com.au", "name": "Charlie Lewis", "type":

A better quote might be: \"Come not between trust fund children and their payout.\"\n\nAs a result of secretive court filings in Reno, Nevada, reported by The New York Times, we've seen how Rupert intends to pull it off: by changing the rules of the trust that holds the family's controlling interest to give Lachlan voting control, empowering him to run the company without interference. All in the best interests of all his children, of course.\n\n\"Stop the steal!\" squeal the three soon-to-be largely disenfranchised children, Prudence, James and Elisabeth, challenging their father's application to change the terms of the trust.\n\n\"Pass the popcorn,\" says the media-watching community.\n\nThis is more than a family spat. The Nevada court is being asked to answer a big question about modern media: is the pro-MAGA right-wing noise machine that Fox and News Corp have become the only viable business model?\n\nRupert -- whose case is being prosecuted by former Donald Trump attorney-general Bill Barr -- believes the answer is a resounding \"yes\". As a result, he seems to be arguing that 52-year-old Lachlan is the only reliable hand in the next generation to keep the tiller pointed in the \"right\" direction.\n\nThe trouble with that argument is that the over-eager embrace of the pro-MAGA business model has already cost the company a cool US$787.5 million (A$1.2 billion) in last year's deal to pay out Dominion Voting Systems after Fox amplified MAGA attacks on the company during Trump's push to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe US courts will soon hear a similar defamation case from another voting tech company, Smartmatic.\n\nThe filings in the Dominion case revealed internal emails and texts about just how the Fox sausage gets made -- and the involvement of the Murdochs in the process.\n\nThe struggles at News Corp -- with yet another round of its Australian journalists being hurried out the door -- suggest that the MAGA strategy doesn't work outside the narrow hot-house of US cable watchers.\n\nThe most vociferous of the company's right-wing voices -- Melbourne's Herald Sun -- has slid from its position as Australia's most popular newspaper. Both in subscriptions and in internet impressions it's even behind the family's long-term bugbear, The Age. Dynasty founder Sir Keith would be rolling in his grave.\n\nRupert has held control of the family's media interests through an undemocratic double-tiered system of weighted votes designed to maximum power and minimise tax.\n\nThere's the Murdoch Family Trust, registered in Nevada. It's the owner of the family's shares in both Fox Corp and News Corp. Although there are seven beneficiaries of this trust -- Rupert and his six children through three of his five wives -- voting on the board is weighted: Rupert gets four, and the four older children get one vote each, giving the Rupert-Lachlan arrangement a controlling five votes. (The younger children, Grace and Chloe, from Rupert's third marriage to Wendi Deng, are equal beneficiaries, but don't get a vote, thanks to the divorce deal with his second wife, Anna).\n\nThe shares in the actual companies are also weighted, using a US securities provision not available in Australia. A minority of shares (Class B) get a vote. Most (Class A) don't. The trust has a controlling majority of the voting shares -- with the number creeping up to over 40% as a result of company share buybacks from other shareholders. The trust has agreed to cap its holding of votes at 44%.\n\nThe market value of the trust's shareholding in the two companies is about US$6 billion -- or about US$1 billion for each of the children.\n\nAmerica's other big media dynasty, the Redstone family, is currently planning on selling its controlling voting shares in Paramount Global (owners of Australia's Ten Network) at a 48% mark-up to pre-sale market price. It offers an attractive (and \"beneficial\") road map for the Murdoch children who no longer work for the family companies.\n\nOn Rupert's death, Lachlan would have a claim on just one-sixth of the trust's beneficial interest and one in four of the votes on the family trust. By changing the votes on the trust, that lesser beneficial interest will be turned into continuing control.

Lee enters the \"Murdoch-verse\" as Inspector Albert Choi, who brings a whole new perspective to Station House #4. Best known for his portrayal as Appa on Kim's Convenience, as well as Uncle Iroh on Netflix's live-action remake of Avatar: The Last Airbender, this new role marks Lee's first foray into the world of period drama.\n\nCBC's most-watched show and Canada's top-rated long-running drama, MURDOCH MYSTERIES is set in Toronto in the early 1900s during the age of invention, where Detective William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) enlists innovative forensic techniques to solve some of the city's most perplexing murders. Notable guest stars on the series have included William Shatner, Margaret Atwood, Geddy Lee, Chris Hadfield, Ed Asner and Nick Nurse, adding star-studded intrigue to its compelling tales. The 18th season, consisting of 22 episodes and celebrating the series' 300th episode, will broadcast on CBC and CBC Gem in Canada this fall, Acorn TV and Ovation TV in the U.S. and on Alibi in the UK.\n\nAhead of the Season 18 premiere of MURDOCH MYSTERIES this fall, a special 'Beginner's Guide to Murdoch Mysteries' collection is now available to stream for free on CBC Gem. The 10 iconic episodes are the perfect Murdoch primer pulled from across the series and highlight the show's trademark mystery, murder and Detective Murdoch's unflappable resolve.\n\n\"We are delighted that Paul has joined us in the world of Murdoch,\" says Executive Producer Peter Mitchell. \"Paul brings a wealth of experience to his role as Inspector Albert Choi and we think the fans will really enjoy seeing him on the team at Station House 4.\"\n\nSeason 18 is full of 'Murdochian' delights: a murder at a Charles Dickens convention; Murdoch acting as a bodyguard for a silent film star (Siobhan Murphy) and thrown into a cinematic adventure himself; foiling a theft of the world's largest ruby; proving the veracity of a 'Missing Link' skull found in Milton, Ontario; and a holiday episode celebrating the 'misfits' and singletons. Episodes that root mysteries in the social issues of the time are also explored: a worker's strike at a factory; an early instance of low-income housing; competing public hydro projects; and immigrants trying to purchase land in the 'paradise' of the wilds of Canada.\n\nMURDOCH MYSTERIES was born out Maureen Jennings' 1997 novel Except the Dying. Key characters in Murdoch's world include Chief Constable Thomas Brackenreid (Thomas Craig), Constables George Crabtree (Jonny Harris) and Henry Higgins (Lachlan Murdoch), Detective Llewellyn Watts (Daniel Maslany), Chief Coroner Violet Hart (Shanice Banton), Margaret Brackenreid (Arwen Humphreys) and Effie Newsome-Crabtree (Clare McConnell) as Canada's first female Crown Attorney. In addition, the milestone 300th episode will see Detective Murdoch visit the UK to see his wife, Dr. Julia Ogden (H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy), as they celebrate their wedding anniversary. This season will also introduce several fresh, new faces, as well as combining the history, humour, romance, and adventure that makes MURDOCH MYSTERIES so popular and unique for viewers around the world.\n\nMURDOCH MYSTERIES is developed and produced by Shaftesbury, in association with CBC, ITV Studios, and UKTV, and with the participation of the Canada Media Fund, the IPF's COGECO Television Production Fund, the Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit and Ontario Creates. Shaftesbury Sales Company and ITV Studios hold worldwide distribution rights for the series.\n\nAbout Shaftesbury\n\nShaftesbury, an award-winning creator and producer of original content for television, film, and digital, was established in 1987 by Christina Jennings, Chairman and President.

Addressing a public meeting in support of AAP candidate Rajkumar Chabbewal, Kejriwal said this election \u201cis to save the country\u2019s democracy and Constitution. This is an election to end dictatorship\u201d. Noting that during the farmers\u2019 movement in 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not allow farmers of Punjab to enter Delhi, he said: \u201cThis time you press such a button that Modi is out of power in Delhi. In this election, you take revenge for the farmers\u2019 agitation from Narendra Modi.\u201d Kejriwal claimed that right after the announcement of the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP got \u201cme arrested so that I could not campaign\u201d. \u201cThey were afraid that if Kejriwal campaigns, the BJP will suffer huge losses in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, and many states of the country. But God heard my voice and released me from jail for 20 days to end the dictatorship of the BJP,\u201d he asserted. \u201cThe way you strengthened the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab by giving it 92 MLAs, similarly, make us strong at the Centre by giving 13 MPs this time. Then no one will be able to stop Punjab\u2019s funds and even the Governor will not be able to stop any bills of Punjab,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now the central government has stopped about eight and a half thousand crore rupees of Punjab. Roads and other development works of Punjab\u2019s villages were to be done with that money,\u201d he added. Kejriwal said that even now, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has to fight alone with the Central government and the Governor. \u201cWhen our 13 MPs win from Punjab, they will all become Bhagwant Mann\u2019s hands and voice and will fight with the Central government and the Governor for the rights of Punjab along with Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann,\u201d he added. Punjab will go to the polls on June 1 in the seventh and last phase of the Lok Sabha elections. \u2013IANS vg/vd", "summary": "<p>Hoshiarpur, May 26 (IANS) Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, campaigning in Punjab&#8217;s Hoshiarpur, on Sunday appealed to the people to support his party&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://indianews.com.au/support-aap-to-save-democracy-says-kejriwal-in-punjab/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Support AAP to save democracy, says Kejriwal in Punjab</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au/support-aap-to-save-democracy-says-kejriwal-in-punjab/\">Support AAP to save democracy, says Kejriwal in Punjab</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au\">Australia India News</a>.</p>", "url": "https://indianews.com.au/support-aap-to-save-democracy-says-kejriwal-in-punjab/", "image": "https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202405263167241.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:04:12", "author": "India News Newsdesk", "authors": ["India News Newsdesk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "AU", "sentiment": -0.636}

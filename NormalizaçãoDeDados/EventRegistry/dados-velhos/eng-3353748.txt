The latest was released three days ago. We are also aware that messages from members of the Independent Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) have continually been filled with hate and derision for other ethnic communities,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Abari, the trend appears to give the impression that Nigerians have not learnt anything from the civil war.\"The 30-month civil war of July 1967 to January 1970, in which over two million of our compatriots lost their lives, was preceded by intolerance and a series of hate speeches, conducts and actions inflicted upon one another by the citizens.

Ibinabo Horsfall, Niger Delta Movement for Justice and others militant leaders, also asked Northern and Yoruba owners of oil blocks in the region to vacate them by October 1.\n\nBut another group of militants, Niger Delta Revolutionary Crusaders, NDRC, on Sunday, sharply disagreed with the CNDA, saying: \"The call for the Yoruba and the Northerners to leave the Niger Delta is not the solution to the genuine demands of the Niger Delta people.\"\n\nSpokesperson of the group, W O I Izon Ebi in an electronic mail to Vanguard, Sunday, declared: \"The NDRC and the 21st century youths of the Niger Delta call on our royal fathers and distinguished personalities of the PANDEF to swing into action to call an emergency meeting to address this current call for the Yoruba and the Northerners to vacate the Niger Delta before October 1.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the group also demanded a time frame for the implementation of the promises, including relocation of operational headquarters to the region, building of oil refineries, take-off Nigerian Maritime University, NMU, Okerenkoko and other palliatives made to PANDEF by the Acting President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, August 4, in Abuja.\n\nNDRC spokesman stated: \"This call is borne out of the PANDEF's inability to call for a meeting to address the agitators and the Niger Delta people after the emergency meeting with the Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osibanjo.\"\n\n\"We also use this medium to tell PANDEF to rise up and condemn the threat of a so- called coalition of militants, telling people that are not of their tribe to leave the region. The NDRC and the 21st century youths of the Niger Delta believe in our children, mothers and the unborn generation, our people's welfare and wellbeing come first.\n\n\"PANDEF and the various federal agencies that are saddled with the responsibility of developing the Niger Delta, for example the NDDC, Niger Delta Development Basin Authority and the Niger Delta Ministry are not doing enough. We, therefore, plead with our brothers to give peace a chance for sincere dialogue since the Acting President has demonstrated the courage and willingness to lead with his conscience,\" the group said.\n\nIt added: \"We plead to all Niger Deltans that there is time for everything and this is the time for a sincere approach. We are all in the same course for a better, peaceful and prosperous Niger Delta for our children and the generation unborn. After war and destruction, we are still going to dialogue, so why the war now that the federal government under the watch of Prof. Yemi Osibanjo is trying to do things in accordance with the best global practice.\"\n\nThe group further stated: \"The NDRC assures every Nigerian, irrespective of their tribe or religion, of their safety in the Niger Delta. The development of the Niger Delta is hinged on peace. If there is no peace, there can be no development, but the NDRC and the 21st century youths do not want peace of the graveyard.\"", "timeCrawl": "10:54:00", "sim": 0.8470588326454163, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "freq": 3, "amb": false, "textEnd": 213, "date": "2017-10-01", "textStart": 204}, {"textStart": 1636, "date": "2017-08-04", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1644}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8904756", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "id": 331, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "id": 405, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "id": 474, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

reached with leaders of the Niger-Delta during a recent meeting with Acting President Yemi Osinbajo. The meeting which led to the suspension of the November 1 ultimatum to the Federal Government was put together by the Pan Niger-Delta Forum (PANDEF). An activist, and co-ordinator, Ijaw Monitoring Group, Comrade Joseph Evah, made the remarks in this interview with 'TUNDE THOMAS. He spoke on various issues.\n\nWhat's your reaction to theNovember 1 ultimatum to the Federal Government by the Pan-Niger-Delta Forum, PANDEF recently to meet its 16-point demand? Although the ultimatum has been withdrawn, the group earlier threatened it would suspend further talks with the Federal Government on issues relating to peace and development of the Niger-Delta region?\n\nAlthough the ultimatum has been withdrawn following talks between PANDEF leaders led by Chief Edwin Clark and the Federal Government, it is unfortunate that the ultimatum had to be issued before Federal Government decided to swing into action.\n\nWhy did the Federal Government refuse to implement or show commitment to the implementation of PANDEF's 16-point demand until PANDEF issued the ultimatum?\n\nThe major problem with our leaders and government is insincerity. The Federal Government promised to implement or start implementing some of these demands several months ago, but in its usual style, after making the promise, the Federal Government went to sleep and it took the PANDEF's ultimatum before it was roused from its slumber. This is very unfortunate. It shows that some of these avoidable crises are a creation of the government itself.\n\nThe Federal Government refused to show respect to the people of Niger Delta and that's why it refused to honour its pledge to the region's leaders, until the ultimatum was issued to push government to take concrete action towards implementing those 16 demands that will serve as a catalyst for the development of Niger-Delta.\n\nI commend our leaders led by Chief E. K. Clark for issuing that ultimatum, because it was getting to a situation where the people of Niger-Delta were getting frustrated with them, and were even accusing PANDEF leaders of not being forceful enough in its demands. Some were even thinking that PANDEF leaders had sold out. It was when the ultimatum was issued that many Niger-Deltans believe that it was the Federal Government that was not showing genuine commitment to the implementation of promises and assurances given to PANDEF leaders.\n\nBut that ultimatum was condemned by the Movement for the Emancipation of Niger-Delta, MEND, and some other prominent Nigerians who described it as unnecessary and a kind of blackmail. They further accused PANDEF leaders, especially Chief Clark of looking the other way and not complaining about underdevelopment of the Niger-Delta when former President Goodluck Jonathan, a Niger-Deltan was in office, what's your take on this?\n\nDon't mind those critics of PANDEF. They are hypocrites. One thing people should realize is this, in any struggle, you will always have some people being sponsored to disorganize the genuine agitations or struggle. This is what is happening in the case of PANDEF.\n\nPANDEF is the only genuine group the people of Niger-Delta recognize. Not only that, the people of the Niger-Delta have put their trust in PANDEF leaders to handle negotiations on their behalf with the Federal Government. Forget what MEND and those other critics are saying. PANDEF leaders are our recognized leaders in Niger-Delta. We won't allow any group or individual to break our ranks or sow seeds of discord among us. We have high regards for Chief E. K. Clark. He is our undisputable leader, no matter whatever anybody says about him. Clark is our hero, a patriot and true leader of the Niger-Delta.\n\nOne thing is this, in any struggle, you will have some dubious groups and individuals being used to scuttle the genuine struggle. These are people we refer to as saboteurs. This is not the first time it will happen. It happened during the June 12 struggle when M.K.O. Abiola was betrayed, it happened during the early struggle for development and emancipation of the Niger-Delta, and we all remembered how the military hanged late Ken Saro-Wiwa for leading the struggle against the injustices in the Niger-Delta. Ken Saro-Wiwa was betrayed. Any group or individual that condemns PANDEF should be regarded as saboteurs. Anybody or group that condemns PANDEF is being sponsored to derail the genuine agitations for the development of Niger-Delta, such groups or individuals should not be taken serious. They are enemies of Niger-Delta.\n\nWhat of the issue of PANDEF leaders looking the other way and not talking during the six years of Jonathan's administration?\n\nPeople saying that need to go and reexamine their heads. People should stop being unfair to Jonathan. They should stop accusing him of not developing Niger-Delta.\n\nFor several years, Gowon, Murtala Muhammed, IBB, General Sani Abacha and Abdusalam Abubakar were presidents and heads of state of Nigeria, but for all the decades they were in office, what did all those leaders who come from the North do for the Northern region? Nothing. Today, poverty is rampant in the North. North is suffering serious underdevelopment, despite all the donkey years that Gowon, IBB, Abdusalam, Murtala Muhammed and Abacha spent in office.\n\nToday, the problem of insecurity is more pronounced in the North than any other region in Nigeria. You have Boko Haram insurgency there, and all these leaders I have mentioned, have they been able to do anything about it? No.\n\nWhat about the Almajiri problem in the North? The menace of Almajiri has been there for decades, and for all the years that all these leaders from the North were in power, were they able to tackle it? What of the problem of illiteracy, infrastructural facilities, decay or even lack of it, were they able to address or tackle all these problems? As we are talking today, you get to some areas in the North, pupils are still learning under trees. They show you some classrooms from the North and you see students sitting down on bare floor to receive lectures. So you ask these leaders from the North why did they fail to transform the North into Dubai of Africa when they were in power.\n\nJonathan was in office for just six years, and people were expecting miracles from him. Jonathan's critics are being unfair to him. Some of Jonathan's critics need to undergo psychiatric tests.\n\nWas it not even during Jonathan's era that Lagos-Ibadan expressway that has become a deathtrap over the years was repaired and given a face lift; when Obasanjo a Yoruba man was President for eight years he abandoned that road. Not only that Obasanjo abandoned his own state, Ogun State. During Obasanjo's time, roads in Ogun State were so terrible that whenever he came home from Abuja, he usually took helicopter from Lagos to his Ota Farms and Abeokuta. Jonathan deserves respect. He should be given his dues. It is only in Nigeria that you see people who call themselves professors or Ph.D holders talking like children.\n\nWhen Obasanjo was there, what did Obasanjo do for the South West? Nothing and I stand to be challenged. Apart from the construction of the Presidential Library which is his personal property, Obasanjo did nothing for the South West.\n\nWhen Obasanjo was military Head of State, the only project he executed or got for the South West was the Ota Farm, which personally belong to him. But today, when Obasanjo moves about, people eulogise him, and give him awards. The same thing for IBB, Gowon and Abdusalam Abubakar; people sing praises of them, but what did all these past leaders achieve or do to transform their regions? Nothing. Go to the North, move into the hinterlands of the North; poverty, hunger, and underdevelopment are more pronounced there than in any other region in Nigeria, and yet the Northern region has produced more leaders than any other region in the country.\n\nPeople should stop their provocative attitudes on Jonathan. They are being unfair to the man. Jonathan deserves the same respect being given to Gowon, IBB and Obasanjo. Nigerians should give him his dues.\n\nOn Chief E. K. Clark, I want to say enough is enough. People should stop disrespecting Clark; Papa Clark is our hero, our own icon. Clark is a selfless leader who loves the people of Niger-Delta and the people also love him and that's why they accept him as their leader.\n\nBut Chief E. K. Clark was accused of making so much money during Jonathan's era that he even built a private university, married a new wife and ...\n\nYes, what's wrong with that? Is Pa E. K. Clark at 90 too young to own a private university? Do these people talking rubbish about the old man know about E.K. Clark's pedigree? Chief E. K. Clark is an accomplished Nigerian. He was a former state commissioner. He was also a former senator and he was also a former minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Clark is also the foremost Ijaw leader. Are these people saying a man with such prestigious record and credentials can't own a private university? This is why I said earlier that some of these critics need to undergo psychiatric tests.\n\nWe will not allow anybody to rubbish or blackmail Chief E. K. Clark. All the private universities in this country, who are the owners? Are they more important or more eminent than Chief E. K. Clark? This is one of the injustices against the Ijaws and people of Niger-Delta. What do some Nigerians take the people of Niger-Delta to be? That we are paupers and second class citizens in Nigeria? God forbid.\n\nLook at the case of oil block ownership in Nigeria; oil is found in Niger-Delta, but the irony of it all is that no Niger-Delta indigene owns an oil block. Rather it is Nigerians from other regions that own the oil wells. What an insult! For example, General T. Y. Danjuma from the North, not because of any other accomplishment but because he was a military leader was given an oil block, while Chief E. K. Clark has none. It is because political leaders from the Niger-Delta are not united, that's why they are perpetrating all these injustices against us. What about the richest woman in Africa, Mrs Folorunsho Alakija who owns an oil well in Bayelsa State. Alakija single-handedly sponsored Babangida University in Minna because she got oil block from IBB's government.\n\nBut some Nigerians are saying that the Niger-Delta appears to be asking for too much in that PANDEF's 16-point demands, what's your view on that?\n\nThat's very unfair to the people of the Niger-Delta. It was the Federal Government that invited Niger-Delta leaders for discussion in the first place, and if you go for a discussion, there must be give-and -take in your discussion. But the Federal Government later slowed down and kept the Niger-Delta leaders in suspense.\n\nThe people of Niger-Delta thereafter started asking their leaders about the talks with the Federal Government. People were expecting to see signs of the Federal Government's commitment to the talks, but none was visible.\n\nFor example, the Federal Government promised to kick-start Maritime University at Okereonkoko, but as we are talking now, nothing has been done. It is a case of empty promise. Since no visible projects by the Federal Government has been seen, some Niger-Delta people started asking Niger-Delta leaders if they had collected bribe from the Federal Government so they could keep quiet. This is one of the reasons that ultimatum was issued by PANDEF.\n\nNiger-Delta people are not blackmailing the Federal Government, it is government that is reneging on its promise to the people.\n\nThe Federal Government has been releasing some Boko Haram suspects under the guise of brokering a peace deal, even Nnamdi Kanu, the IPOB leader was released on bail, but some Niger-Delta indigenes are still languishing in detention, rotting away in jail. Is that not another case of injustice. If Kanu is granted bail and Boko Haram suspects are released, what prevents the Federal Government from releasing Niger-Delta political detainees like Edward Eduware, Charles Okah and Henry Okah? If the Federal Government is applying political solution to problems of Nigeria by releasing Kanu and Boko Haram suspects, then our own children from the Niger-Delta in detention should also be released? The South East took up their struggle, today Nnamdi Kanu is on bail. I also was among those that fought for Kanu's bail. But what about Ijaw people in detention like Eduware and Okah brothers?\n\nThese are some of the injustices our leaders in PANDEF are trying to address, and the Federal Government should be seen to be fair to all.\n\nChief E. K. Clark is our own mouth-piece. Niger-Delta people want dialogue and not violence, and therefore, it will be wrong to describe those who want peace as trouble makers. As we speak now, the Federal Ministry of Finance is starving the Amnesty Programme office of funds.\n\nAre you saying the Amnesty Programme is being underfunded?\n\nYes, and it is being very unfair to the people of Niger-Delta. It is obvious that some people in this present administration are not happy with the Amnesty Programme, and if they actually have their way, they would scrap it. But is this not another case of injustice against the people of Niger-Delta?\n\nSince 1989, nomadic education programme has been going on in the northern parts of the country. Jibril Aminu who was then Minister of Education under Gen. Ibrahim Babangida introduced nomadic education.\n\nHow many people from Niger-Delta own oil block? None.\n\nIf it is Asari Dokubo that declared that he doesn't know what to do with money again, they would declare him a criminal. Dan Etete, an indigene of Niger-Delta applied for oil block and licence, they denied him while people from the North and other parts of the country have oil blocks. Is this not an injustice? Those of us who have oil at our backyard are denied oil licence whereas people who don't have oil at all in their areas are being given our oil wells. Is that not injustice? Is it not unfair for people to say that Niger-Delta people are asking for too much? We are not asking for too much, but demanding our rights.\n\nSome people have expressed fears that militancy might return to the Niger-Delta if there is no breakthrough in talks between the Federal Government and PANDEF, what's your take on that?\n\nWe don't want militancy to resume and that is why our leaders have been meeting with the Federal Government.\n\nBut what can guarantee sustainable peace is for the Federal Government to do the needful in Niger-Delta. If these injustices against our people are addressed, there will be peace, but if the Federal Government chooses not to fulfill its own obligations to the people, then the Federal Government should be held responsible for any consequences. There is no guarantee that bombings and militancy will not resume in Niger-Delta if the Federal Government fails to honour its promises to the people.\n\nWhat is your reaction to the recent rejection of devolution of power by the Senate?\n\nI'm disappointed, likewise others especially those from the southern part of the country. Rejection of devolution of power is also another way of rejecting restructuring. The Senate is playing with fire by rejecting devolution of power. Without restructuring, we are not going anywhere. Without restructuring, agitations here and there will not go away. Nigeria will not have peace unless we restructure.\n\nThe Senate had a golden opportunity to do the needful but missed it. It is only a true practice of federalism as enshrined in the Constitution of the First Republic that can move this nation forward.\n\nSome of our former leaders like General Yakubu Gowon, General Babangida and former President Olusegun Obasanjo have been appealing to Nigerians to let peace reign following recurring violence and series of crises here and there in different parts of the country; how do you see these appeals?\n\nGowon, Obasanjo and IBB are hypocrites. Why are they suing for peace now when they were the source of Nigeria's headache? Don't mind these people, if they had done what they were supposed to have done when they were in power, Nigeria will not be in this terrible mess. Actually, some of our former leaders laid the foundation of the current crises facing the nation.\n\nWhen these leaders were in power, they didn't listen to advice, those who will tell them the truth and give them the right advice, they chase them away. They were acting as if they were God. Nigerians should not take them serious. When they were in power, you couldn't even talk to them. They were very arrogant and unreachable.\n\nLook at somebody like Obasanjo; see how he treated those people that were accused alongside with him for plotting that phantom coup. When Obasanjo became president after he had been granted pardon, he promised to help these people but for eight years he was in power, he did nothing about the case of these people.\n\nObasanjo knew that these people were falsely accused like him, yet he refused to help them. All the former leaders of Nigeria were bad managers, and that's why Nigeria is where we are today. I would have even said these leaders should offer the nation an apology for putting Nigeria in this mess, but if you ask them to apologise, they will tell you that it is even Nigerians that are owing them apology. The only way to move this country forward is to restructure. There is no alternative to restructuring. True federalism was working well for us in the First Republic, but the military came and truncated it.\n\nToday, Nigeria is in crisis because we jettisoned true practice of federalism. For peace to reign, people have been clamouring for restructuring but it appears some forces that are benefitting from the status quo are bent on frustrating any attempt to restructure, and it is the same forces at play that manipulated or used the Senate to jettison demands for devolution of power. What we all don't know is that we are all sitting on a keg of gun powder which can explode anytime.

A move some Nigerians said was too controversial and laden with greed from the elders of the region.\n\nSeveral months after its meetings with the President Buhari and later with the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, PANDEF felt that with almost one year after it presented the 16-point demand, nothing has been done. This prompted the group to issue a threat a fortnight ago that it would pull out of the negotiation. The implication of this is that the militant groups in the region would resume their hostilities on oil installations along the creeks of the Niger Delta.\n\nThe threat of pulling out of the peaceful dialogue did not go down well with the foremost militant group, Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), which lampooned the Forum as an association of fund-seekers whose major interest was just to line their pockets to the detriment of the generality of the Niger Delta people.\n\nJomo Gbomo, the spokesman of MEND had expressed shock over the 1st November ultimatum issued to the Federal Government by the group and wondered why Chief Edwin Clark and King Alfred Diete-Spiff PANDEF had to issue such ultimatum.\n\nIn a statement he signed two weeks ago, Gbomo said: \"Instead of listening to the so-called Niger Delta activists and the compromised Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), who have miraculously regained the voices they lost when Jonathan was President, and instead of issuing threats through fake internet-based militant groups, PANDEF ought to have used the forum and opportunity to commend the Federal Government for exposing the monumental looting of our commonwealth by some sons and daughters of the soil.\n\n\"PANDEF is also pretending not to notice that the Amnesty Programme is still operating on the corrupt template that still pays ghost militants after it hoodwinked the government into believing in the fraud.\"\n\nVarious militant groups in the region have also called on PANDEF to stop further negotiations with the Federal Government as they were set to declare the Republic of the Niger Delta amidst the heat of the quit notice issued by the Arewa Youth Council and the agitation for the declaration of Biafra.\n\nThis development, according to some stakeholders, may cause a huge setback in the negotiation thereby leading to its total collapse. With the major militant groups and its subsidiaries calling for an end to the negotiation, the question therefore is, whom should the Federal Government trust to discuss the Niger Delta issues with?\n\nGiving an insight on this, High Chief Anabs Sara-Igbe who is an influential member of PANDEF insisted that, the Federal Government had no other credible group to engage other than the Forum on anything that has to do with the region.\n\n\"PANDEF is a regional and the umbrella body of the Niger Delta just like you have Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum, Ohanaeze Indigbo among others. The Forum is doing a good job by engaging the Federal Government on key issues that affect us as a people. We have prominent sons and daughters of the Niger Delta region in that group.\n\n\"What is most important to us is how to reposition the Niger Delta in such a manner that our economy will improve, in such a manner that we will create employment and drive infrastructure. We will boost the economy so that the Nigerian State will not see us only as Niger Delta, but see it as the industrial hub of the country,\" he said.\n\nSara-Igbe said PANDEF is the composition of various groups with membership drawn from MEND, pressure groups among others. \"The Federal Government has only been negotiating with us. Very soon, we will have structures in all the states of the region\".\n\nHe went on to say that the Forum has the capacity to \"reach out to the boys in the creeks and also negotiates with government\".\n\nIn his comment on this, the former President of the Ijaw National Congress, INC, and a retired Professor of Political Science, University of Port Harcourt, Professor Kimse Okoko said everything about the entire negotiation was \"very confusing to me\", saying the government knows what the Niger Delta people want.\n\nHe said: \"We want restructuring. When Nigeria is restructured, every other thing will fall in place. Outside restructuring, every other thing is secondary.\n\n\"I know that PANDEF had presented a 16-point demand to the Federal Government. Some of the items there are not important to me. I also know that government has been negotiating with them and other groups too. What I don't know is the relationship MEND has with them.\n\n\"What I think is more important is for this country to be restructured along the line of true federalism. That is all. We want a complete ownership of our resources and then pay tax to the Federal Government. For how long will they continue to negotiate with the Niger Delta?\n\n'\"We saw some persons in PANDEF who visited the President and at another time a different set of people from the same PANDEF visited the Vice President. As I said, the whole thing is confusing to me.\"\n\nIn contrast, the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), a youth wing of INC, said it recognizes PANDEF as the only negotiating body the Niger Delta region has until it is dissolved.\n\nBarrister Henry Iyalla, spokesman of IYC, in an interview said, \"PANDEF still remains the negotiation body known to the good people of the Niger Delta.\"\n\nIyalla said the recent calls for the elders to hands off all negotiation duties \"is borne out of prolong delay by the federal government to implement the 16-point agenda agreed with the region.\n\n\"While we are not comfortable with the hasty withdrawal of its ultimatum because of mere promises by the Federal Government, they should not forget that they are speaking on behalf of the Niger Delta region and should not be swayed by the soothing words from the government.\"\n\nCorroborating Professor Okoko's position, the IYC spokesman warned that PANDEF should not shy away from engaging the government on the issue of restructuring in line with fiscal federalism.\n\n\"We need to manage and control our resources and pay royalty to the center. We therefore call on the government not to play politics with the collective good of the region that lay the golden egg\".\n\nIyalla however called on all the militant groups to exercise \"restraint and give the elders some patience to tackle the Federal Government for the collective good of the region.\"\n\nBut the fear of some people is that the government may take advantage of the crack amongst the various groups in the Niger Delta and further delay the implementation of the demands presented to it by the elders of the region.\n\nAlready, such militant groups as the Niger Delta Avengers, NDA, Niger Delta Security Watch Organisation of Nigeria, (NDSWON); Ijaw People's Development Initiative (IPDI); Foundation for Human Rights and Anti-Corruption Crusaders, (FOHURAC), and Ijaw Human Rights Monitors (IHRM) have shown readiness to return to trenches if the government fails to leave up to the expectation.\n\nWith the present situation in the country and a bleak national economy still in recession, further damage to oil facilities thereby leading to shortage in supply of crude to the international market, would be disastrous.", "timeCrawl": "03:27:00", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "extractedDates": [{"date": "-11-01", "textStart": 1786, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1798}, {"date": "2016-11-01", "textStart": 787, "amb": false, "textEnd": 803}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8867226", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "id": 108, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "id": 276, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Regional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Regional", "id": 334, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Lobbying", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Lobbying", "id": 469, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science_and_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science and Technology", "id": 916, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

medical vacation and would only return on the instruction of his doctors. Although Acting President Yemi Osinbajo has been ably holding forte for him in the governance of the country, the state of the nation appears to suggest that some issues would wait for the President's return before being resolved.\n\nIt could be recalled that Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, had said penultimate Thursday that President Buhari's illness made Nigeria sick and called for prayers for his healing. But his statement drew the ire of many Nigerians who branded him a sycophant and argued that the nation was greater than the President. But why has the foundation of the country continued to quake in spite of the administrative prowess of the Acting President? Why are the issues at stake not getting resolved? Why has Boko Haram re-grouped months after the Nigerian Army declared victory over them? Why is the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) lacking cohesion?\n\nIn this report, Sunday Sun takes a look at some of the issues and the underlining reasons they have been defying solutions.\n\nRestructuring/devolution of powers:\n\nThe unity of the country has been under threat in recent months and there had been calls for the restructuring of the country or devolution of powers to the federating units as the solution. The National Assembly had in the ongoing constitution amendment exercise included Devolution of Powers in the amendment bills. The Bill was intended to delineate the extent to which the federal legislature and state assemblies could legislate on the items that have been moved to the Concurrent Legislative List. Political commentators say the Bill would have formed the crux of restructuring of the polity, but the Bill failed in both the Senate and the House of representatives. The red chamber had rejected it with 90 votes against five on Wednesday, July 26. Though the bill got overwhelming endorsement with 210 votes for and 71 against at the House on Thursday, July 27, the amendment did not scale through as the 'yes' votes fell short of the constitutionally required 240 (two-third majority) threshold. The failure of the Bill has given fresh impetus to the crusade for restructuring.\n\nLast Sunday, Southern leaders under the aegis of Southern Leaders Forum called on their colleagues from the North to renegotiate Nigeria. The Southern leaders, drawn from three geopolitical zones of the south, made their position known after a meeting in Lagos. The leaders had said Nigeria was approaching a terminal crisis from which it cannot recover unless it is restructured along the paths of the 1963 Constitution. They also said the National Assembly's rejection of the proposal for devolution was against popular demand, vowing that they will press on with their demand until the issue was brought to a conclusion.\n\nAlthough Osinbajo has been relentless in his efforts to douse the increasing tension in the land over the issue, he has certainly not succeeded. The demand for restructuring is very popular in the South but is largely detested in the North. The President is a northerner and it would amount to foolhardiness for the Federal Government under Osinbajo's interim leadership take a definite stand on the issue and deploy government's resources towards implementing it. From every indication, the issue of restructuring would wait until Buhari returns.\n\nSecessionist agitations:\n\nAs a fallout of the rejection of the proposal for devolution of powers by the National Assembly, there have been increasing agitations for secession by many sections of the country. For instance, on Thursday, July 27, a coalition of Yoruba groups, the Yoruba Liberation Command (YOLICOM), declared that the Yorubas were set to secede from Nigeria to form Oduduwa Republic. The coalition included ancient Yoruba warlord, Agbekoya and Oodua Redemption Alliance, among others. Spokesperson of the coalition, Opeoluwa Akinola, had at a press conference in Lagos said Nigeria was slowing down the progress of the Yorubas, and killing and maiming the citizens for selfish interests.\n\nAlso in the Niger Delta, the Adaka Boro Avengers (ABA), a militant group, penultimate Monday said they would declare a republic in the oil rich region on October 1. The group had sometime in 2016 issued a similar threat but later withdrew it citing pleas by concerned elders, leaders and people of Niger Delta region. But they have vowed not to back down this time around.\n\n\"The October 1 declaration of a republic in the Niger Delta is sacrosanct because Nigeria has lost its unity. We the Avengers have always carried out our words. When we said we would crumble the economy, we did it. And now we are asking all northerners and westerners to leave the Niger Delta region for their own good. This is not 2016 and now we have more arsenals, more powerful than the Nigerian government,\" spokesperson of the group, Edmos Ayayeibo, said.\n\nIt could be recalled that before now, it was only the South-east geo-political zone that had been pushing for a sovereign state of Biafra through the Movement for the Actualisation of a Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) over alleged marginalisation of the zone in the scheme of things in the country. But even that movement assumed a new dimension recently when the leader of the Biafra Zionist Federation (BZF), Mr. Benjamin Onwuka, declared himself as the new Biafran President and announced an interim government to run the affairs of the republic. Apart from declaring himself the President of Biafra Republic, Onwuka who briefed journalists in Enugu, also named his cabinet.\n\nThe Department of State Security (DSS) had recently vowed to deal with any group or individuals pursuing divisive and separatist activities that threaten national security. But the agency has so far not taken any visible action in that regard. Nonetheless, the issue of secessionist agitations is very complex and requires a discreet approach. If mishandled, it could lead to full conflagration, which might sound the death knell on the country. So, the security agencies might have been waiting for Buhari to return and show the direction to go, as he certainly does not wish to be the last President of Nigeria.\n\nNiger Delta crisis:\n\nIndications that there might be resumption of hostilities in the Niger Delta region emerged recently when the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), a coalition of elders and leaders of the region, asked the Federal Government to meet its 16-point agenda by November 1, 2017, or risk its withdrawal from ongoing negotiations that had calmed nerves in the oil-rich zone in the last one year. At a press conference in Abuja recently, PANDEF's National Leader/Convener, Chief Edwin Clark, had warned that: \"If at the expiration of November 1, 2017, ultimatum the Federal Government either fails or refuses to accede to these lawful and legitimate demands of the Niger Delta people, PANDEF may consider pulling out of the ongoing peace process in the Niger Delta.\"\n\nAlready, the Niger Delta Revolutionary Crusaders (NDRC), in a statement last Monday by its spokesman, Mr. Izon Ebi, has threatened to resume attacks on oil facilities on September 31, 2017, even as it urged PANDEF to stop all talks with the Federal Government.\n\nRecall that PANDEF submitted a 16-point demand to the Federal Government on November 1, 2016. The agenda includes matters like the continuation of the Presidential Amnesty Programme and the institutionalisation of such lifetime thing as fiscal federalism. It also wants the Federal Government to ensure the immediate take off of the Nigeria Maritime University in Okerenkoko; the erection of a deep seaport in Gbaramanu; the demilitarisation of Niger Delta; the resumption of the establishment of Export Processing Zone comprising Gas City project at Ogidigben; progress in Ogoni clean up and environmental remediation; inclusive participation (of Niger Delta people) in oil industry and ownership of oil blocks; building regional infrastructure; regular power supply; restructuring and funding of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC); enforcement of law/justice; security surveillance and protection of oil and gas infrastructure; amelioration of the plight of internally displaced persons; economic development and empowerment of the people of Niger Delta and resettlement of Bakassi internally displaced people.\n\nThere is no gainsaying the fact that Osinbajo has been very pragmatic and reassuring in his efforts to restore order in the Niger Delta, but some of the issues in the list require long term planning and implementation. The President would definitely return to face those ones.\n\nBoko Haram insurgency:\n\nAfter some months of fragile peace and order in the North-east following the gains recorded by the Nigerian Army against Boko Haram insurgents, there is every indication that the insurgents have re-grouped and are back to the trenches. Apart from bombing soft targets and killing hapless citizens in the act, the July 25 ambush of some staff of the University of Maiduguri and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on an exploration spree for crude oil around the Lake Chad Basin area of Borno State is a pointer that the war is far from being over. Reports had it that nine soldiers, four UNIMAID staff and 14 others were killed in Boko Haram ambush. The UNIMAID chapter of ASUU had also confirmed five staff dead while four were missing. A recent video released by the insurgents showed three of the abductees alive with one of them, Dr Solomon Yusuf, calling on the media to help in the campaign to free them from the hands of their captors.\n\nBorno State Governor, Kashim Shettima, last Tuesday confirmed that Boko Haram insurgents had killed 31 fishermen at Baga in Kukawa Local Government Area of the state. Also last Wednesday, the insurgents reportedly killed seven people in an early morning attack on Midlu village of Vapura ward in Madagali Local Government Area of Adamawa State.\n\nAlarmed by the fresh wave of attacks, the Acting President recently directed military service chiefs to move back to the Command Centre in Maiduguri. They have quite complied with the order and have been working hard to again turn the tide against the terrorists. But how did the Army lose steam in the first instance? It could be that they were tapping from the experience of the President as a retired army officer in waging the war all these while and lost focus in his absence. So, even though the service chiefs are back to Maiduguri, they may not make much gain in the battle until the President returns.\n\nAPC convention:\n\nThe house of the ruling party is obviously not in order even if they don't admit that. But the leadership appears not to have a solution to the issues because the President, who should provide direction, is on medical leave. The party's National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun has not called for a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting in recent times while the National Convention of the party has also been put on hold, all waiting for Buhari's return. Governor Abdulaziz Yari of Zamfara State had admitted recently that the illness of the President was behind the inactivity in the party.\n\n\"We have been on this matter of convention but you know that the President is the leader of this party. One, before getting to the convention, there is some kind of process, the National Working Committee (NWC) must agree on the time and at the same time we have to adopt the report submitted by the NWC to the larger NEC members which the President must be in attendance as the leader of the party and you know the situation of our President,\" Yari said.\n\nSo, amid the burning national issues which the absence of the President is delaying their resolution, even the APC is waiting for Buhari. And Nigerians are waiting for Mr. President.", "timeCrawl": "07:24:00", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "extractedDates": [{"date": "-05-07", "textStart": 51, "amb": false, "textEnd": 56}, {"textStart": 1936, "date": "2017-07-26", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1943}, {"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2057, "date": "2017-07-27", "textStart": 2050}, {"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 4318, "date": "2017-10-01", "textStart": 4309}, {"date": "2017-11-01", "textStart": 6604, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 6620}, {"date": "2016-11-01", "textStart": 7446, "amb": false, "textEnd": 7462}, {"textStart": 9110, "date": "2017-07-25", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 9117}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8884671", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Also last Wednesday, the insurgents reportedly killed seven people in an early morning attack on Midlu village of Vapura ward in Madagali Local Government Area of Adamawa State.\n\nAlarmed by the fresh wave of attacks, the Acting President recently directed military service chiefs to move back to the Command Centre in Maiduguri. They have quite complied with the order and have been working hard to again turn the tide against the terrorists. But how did the Army lose steam in the first instance? It could be that they were tapping from the experience of the President as a retired army officer in waging the war all these while and lost focus in his absence. So, even though the service chiefs are back to Maiduguri, they may not make much gain in the battle until the President returns.\n\nAPC convention:\n\nThe house of the ruling party is obviously not in order even if they don't admit that. But the leadership appears not to have a solution to the issues because the President, who should provide direction, is on medical leave. The party's National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun has not called for a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting in recent times while the National Convention of the party has also been put on hold, all waiting for Buhari's return. Governor Abdulaziz Yari of Zamfara State had admitted recently that the illness of the President was behind the inactivity in the party.\n\n\"We have been on this matter of convention but you know that the President is the leader of this party. One, before getting to the convention, there is some kind of process, the National Working Committee (NWC) must agree on the time and at the same time we have to adopt the report submitted by the NWC to the larger NEC members which the President must be in attendance as the leader of the party and you know the situation of our President,\" Yari said.\n\nSo, amid the burning national issues which the absence of the President is delaying their resolution, even the APC is waiting for Buhari. And Nigerians are waiting for Mr. President.", "timeCrawl": "01:57:00", "sim": 0.615686297416687, "extractedDates": [{"date": "-05-07", "textStart": 51, "amb": false, "textEnd": 56}, {"textStart": 1936, "date": "2017-07-26", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1943}, {"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2057, "date": "2017-07-27", "textStart": 2050}, {"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 4318, "date": "2017-10-01", "textStart": 4309}, {"date": "2017-11-01", "textStart": 6604, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 6620}, {"date": "2016-11-01", "textStart": 7446, "amb": false, "textEnd": 7462}, {"textStart": 9110, "date": "2017-07-25", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 9117}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8862271", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The Director General stated that the Agency was set up to facilitate the development and promotion of MSMEs in Nigeria and the visit of the MD of NDDC to the Agency is highly commendable and apt.\n\nThe Director General of SMEDAN added that the Agency was well positioned to create jobs and alleviate poverty in the country and always ready to work with the NDDC in the implementation of its work plan for the development of the Niger Delta region. The Director General of SMEDAN also informed the Managing Director that the Agency has 23 Industrial Development Centers nationwide set up to provide technical manpower for industries in the country and four of these Centers are located in the Niger Delta Region.\n\nHe lamented that facilities in the IDCs are dilapidated with most of the equipment obsolete coupled with the problem of land encroachment. The Director General, however, stated that the Agency received a grant from the\n\nAfrican Development Bank (ADB) to study how the IDCs can be turned around to become enterprise clusters. According to the Director General, SMEDAN is planning to convert the IDCs into enterprise clusters where enterprises involved in similar products and activities will be located in the same place with all necessary machines, equipment and trainings provided for them. He equally emphasized that being in the same location makes it easier for regulatory agencies to monitor their performances, for financial institutions to provide loans and help to facilitate linkage to markets for their products and services.\n\nDr Radda assured the NDDC boss that SMEDAN will collaborate with his commission to see how both institutions can develop the sustainability of the IDCs located in the Niger Delta Region. He said SMEDAN would initiate a proposal that would be beneficial to the Niger Delta region and prayed that that the commission keys into it to develop the region. He further reiterated that SMEDAN has the experience and capacity to assist the NDDC in creating wealth and reducing poverty in the region through effective collaboration to move Nigeria forward. The Director General of SMEDAN condemned the absence of synergy between government agencies and parastatals. In his words \"we tend to see ourselves as competitors rather than collaborators\". Dr Radda noted that the NDDC boss's visit to the Agency was a demonstration of good visionary leadership and assured him of the Agency's resolve to make him achieve his mandate at NDDC.\n\nThe Director General intimated the NDDC Managing Director that that the Agency signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Niger Delta where it trained about 10,000 youths under the Amnesty Programme and the DG was optimistic that the visit of the MD, NDDC will enable the two institutions work more closely.\n\nEarlier the Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC Obong Nsime Nkere said he was in SMEDAN to see how both Agencies can work together by exploring ways of bringing meaningful development to the people of the Niger Delta Region.\n\nHe said the challenges been faced in the Niger Delta region is that over 70 per cent of the land mass is below water level making it difficult and very expensive to build infrastructure.\n\nThe Managing Director said the only paramount thing for the NDDC is to see how they can tackle unemployment, poverty, youth restiveness and other vices. He added by saying that \"one of the major causes of insecurity in our terrain is poverty and unemployment and that is why we are here, because we believe SMEDAN is strategically located to assist us\".\n\nEkere said he strongly believes that SMEDAN will be able to assist NDDC to develop specific programmes relating to entrepreneurship that will be sustainable and create jobs for the regions teeming unemployed youths, so that our economy will grow and reduce the rate of youth restiveness in the region.", "timeCrawl": "06:08:00", "sim": 0.4901960790157318, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8878094", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "id": 114, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "id": 332, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "id": 486, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Agents_and_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Agents and Agencies", "id": 936, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Software", "id": 1393, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

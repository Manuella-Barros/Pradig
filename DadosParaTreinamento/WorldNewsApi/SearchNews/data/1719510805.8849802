MailOnline's Stella Radeva embarks on Eastern Europe Kalashnikov course used by private military operatives around the world - with amazing results", "text": "It wasn't the first time I had held a gun... but it was the first time it felt like I was going to use it for real. Was I scared? Absolutely! In my hand rested an AK-47 - one of the deadliest and most infamous weapons in the world. And there I was being marched through a bombed-out village in a torrential downpour to confront a would-be armed enemy. Deafening commands barked by a grizzled combat veteran - 'Confront front! Prepare to move!' - rang in my ears as I nervously stalked through the devastated streets. But this wasn't Call Of Duty - I was being coached on a full-blown, three-day AK Operator/Designated Marksman course in Bulgaria by seasoned British Army Veteran Simon Feek. Simon is dedicated to preparing volunteer soldiers for the grim realities of frontline warfare in Ukraine and beyond, with people travelling from all corners of the globe to learn the skills necessary to go to battle. He agreed to show me exactly what volunteers who decide to sign up to defend Kyiv can expect - and put me through the kind of training that millions of Brits may face should national service be reinstated in near future. When Simon introduced me to the world of war, we weren't straight out on the firing range. Like every diligent student, my training began in the classroom. The three-day military skills course I embarked on usually served as a 'refresher' for ex-military types heading into conflicts dotted throughout the globe. But the training has been adapted to place a growing emphasis on getting every day civilians geared up for war-related responsibilities and civil defence roles. That said, Simon sternly warned us that civilians with no prior military experience would not be 'ready' for war after only three days, and would require more training before heading off to battle. 'I'd say 95 per cent of people that come to us have got zero prior experience', Simon said. 'They might have been on some silly stag do shooting experience in Poland, or Prague - which is really not what we do. 'A lot of these guys come to us thinking they know how to operate that weapon but at the same time, the AK operator's course isn't just about operating a weapon.' He added: 'It's about giving you those skills, which normally only people who are lucky enough to serve their armed forces have been given.' Later, after a few hours of meticulously poring over British Army combat tactics, it was finally time to put theory into action. Safety was paramount, of course. Simon walked me through the essentials: strapping on my bulletproof vest, securing a war belt, and slipping on ear defenders. But with the necessary gear in place, it was time to load up on bullets and magazines - and I could feel the weight of anticipation building with each click and snap as I readied my weapon. Gripping the Kalashnikov in my hands, I was ready for my first day on the 'battlefield'. Simon guided me through the basics: loading, reloading and clearing the weapon. Starting off simple, we focused on finding our footing and honing our aim. With targets set in the distance, I squared my stance and took aim. With each shot fired, I could feel my 'military mojo' growing, my shots hitting closer to the mark with each attempt. Simon said that he was not here to give me compliments but when he did, he said that I was their ideal student. 'Our students tend to be well educated, mature. They understand that what we are doing is inherently dangerous, so they tend to listen very well,' he said. But the key ingredient to a successful training season is quick critical thinking under pressure, according to the ex-British soldier. 'Anyone can shoot a weapon, that's easy. Most people spend time watching others do it, feeling overly confident,' he said. 'But when they hit the range, they realise it's not just about shooting. 'That's why we simulate real-life scenarios like active shooter situations or terrorist acts - to push you into that mindset, to see how you react because when the day comes - we won't be there.' By day three we were training to suppress and attack the enemy, and the once heavy gun was beginning to feel lighter \u2013 more like an extension of my arm. I was growing in confidence, moving with intent, with actual purpose \u2013 something Simon says he sees happen to many young men and women who take on this course. 'You can see them growing in their confidence in front of you because all of a sudden, they're kind of a bit more aware,' he said. However, he added that 'female students tend to listen and absorb more during initial training'. 'This means around 30 per cent are competent shooters ''right out the box'' compared to around 15 per cent of men,' Simon declared. 'We really hope [they] will never have to use these skills but if [they] do, I'd feel fairly confident that [they] would stand more of a chance than most people.' Simon first established his training organisation - PrepYou - eight years ago after a Tunisian terrorist attack in 2015. PrepYou boasts an international team of former NATO soldiers, bringing a wealth of experience and expertise to their mission. 'We have trained over 90 nationalities and are missing only one EU country, San Marino, to complete Europe,' said Simon. Explaining why he chose Bulgaria as a training ground, Simon divulged that the country's firearms laws are more relaxed than the UK, allowing for a unique training experience. He told MailOnline: 'We have been training people in pistol shooting which we just can't do in the United Kingdom. 'We've got a lot more freedom [in Bulgaria]. 'In a controlled environment like this we can train civilians to do things which only the military enforcement normally get the experience to do.' He added: 'We are close to Ukraine so we have quite a lot of colleagues there and we try and support them as much as we can whether that's in terms of providing kit or equipment.' As tensions have continued to escalate between Ukraine and Russia, PrepYou has became a beacon for individuals eager to contribute to the Ukrainian resistance. Following the overwhelming response to the conflict, Simon's company has evolved into one of the leading providers of military and medical training in the Balkans. Describing the Ukraine war as a 'different kettle of fish,' he said: 'I have no crystal ball. 'What we're looking at today, the Russians are making progress slowly but surely because of - frankly - a lack of support from NATO.' Giving his two cents on wars happening elsewhere, he predicted a multi-front conflict would happen in a matter of 'months not years'. 'We're massively outnumbered,' he said: 'The British Army could currently fit in Anfield football stadium. 'We can't defend our own country. If the military isn't prepared, then the general population is definitely not.' PrepYou trains a staggering 1,000 people on average each year - but at times the number of participants has spiked far higher. 'It became a bit of macabre joke,' he said. 'My colleagues and I used to say that we'd know if there was a terrorist attack happening, because our phones would be flooded with messages from students asking if we were available. 'And that is exactly what happened after the attack on Israel in October last year.' He said 'there is an awful lot more interest in the subject', as you never know when you might find yourself on the front lines. Having worked in the blistering heat of Iraq and Morocco, the Operations Director of PrepYou divulged that they are also hoping to expand their courses to wider afield. 'Last year I was in North Africa delivering medical equipment, and some training over there to a client,' Simon said. 'We can't do this by ourselves, we need to expand and go more multinational.", "summary": "MailOnline video journalist Stella Radeva reveals all about her intensive military training with ex-British soldier Simon Feek, who prepares people to go to the frontlines of Ukraine and beyond", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13414017/handling-gun-kalashnikov-course-military-warzone-results.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/26/13/85350937-0-image-a-15_1716726287915.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:52:39", "author": "Editor,Stella Radeva", "authors": ["Editor", "Stella Radeva"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.273}

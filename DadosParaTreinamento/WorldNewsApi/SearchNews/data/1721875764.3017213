To the 55-year-old professional classical musician, who plays and teaches viola and violin, having music in her life is \u201clike an imperative that you have to obey\u201d. But lately, she\u2019s had to make hard decisions about her music \u2013 a direct consequence of the rising cost of living. \u201cAs a musician I value live music experiences, but these have been mostly missed out on as I can\u2019t afford them,\u201d Olivieri says. \u201cEven the bands that I love that my colleagues play in. Tickets for those are just getting more expensive while they try to cover the cost of their lives \u2013 and rightfully so.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It\u2019s not just music. It\u2019s \u201cmeals out or hanging out in cafes, steak nights (only the cheapest ones, which all went up in price and down in size after Covid) are all rare now, and at home it\u2019s rationing and only the necessities,\u201d she says. It\u2019s also holidays: Cathi and her son Theo last went overseas when he was two. He\u2019s now 18, and the trips they have managed in the 16 years since have been \u201csporadic, and less than a week maximum\u201d. The furthest away they\u2019ve been from their home town of Fremantle, in Western Australia, is Exmouth, about 1,000km north. While that was \u201cabsolutely gorgeous and great,\u201d Olivieri says, \u201cI just want to travel\u201d. The cost of participation Culture is a cost-of-living issue. When Guardian Australia asked colleagues, friends and members of the public about the things they were giving up due to financial pressures, the cultural portrait they painted was bleak. Gone were the art classes, swimming lessons, and birthday parties for children. Trips to the cinema or the theatre. Nights out with friends. Travel \u2013 whether by aeroplane or toll road. Extracurricular or community sport. And the primary barrier is money. For community sporting organisations that rely on player memberships for their mere existence, player attrition due to cost is an obstacle that doesn\u2019t just affect the financial solvency of a club or its ability to field a team, but the very shape of the club\u2019s community. Nathan McLean, the vice-president of the Footscray United Rangers community football club, in Melbourne\u2019s west, says players have found it increasingly difficult to stump up cash for membership, let alone the uniforms, mouthguards, boots and other required playing gear. Then there\u2019s the cost of travelling long distances for games, and managing any injuries throughout the season. Recent data from the Australian Sports Commission shows the average Australian adult spent $1,304 on participating in sport in the 2022-2023 financial year, while the average annual cost for a child under 14 was $1,369. It\u2019s a significant leap since the onset of Covid: the average annual cost for adults in 2018-2019 was $913 and for children $882. \u201cIt is tough at the moment [for players],\u201d McLean says. \u201cWe think football is for everyone, and every individual is welcome to play. So we looked at a range of different disadvantaged groups to see what we can do with the skills and strengths and networks we have.\u201d The Rangers came up with ways to offset some of the cost burden on players, particularly those in its fledgling adult women\u2019s team, children with disabilities and refugees. They set up a financial hardship bursary, which has allowed them to support a handful of players to play for free. Their entire disability sport program is paid for by a corporate sponsor. Last year, the club raised funds for a bursary especially dedicated to assisting players from the region\u2019s refugee communities. Currently, the bursary supports a cohort of 13 players across its 11 teams. \u201cSoccer is such a simple game to bring people together. That\u2019s why I love it,\u201d McLean says. \u201cBut still have a lot of people feeling the pinch \u2026 There\u2019s definitely a challenge there.\u201d \u2018Music is a therapeutic pursuit\u2019 Theo Olivieri, Cathi\u2019s son, is a first year major in creative writing and screen arts at Curtin University. This semester, he took up a photography subject, which he loves. \u201cI have been taking all my assessment photos on this little compact camera that I got in 2017, a little digital camera, because it\u2019s the only camera I have. My mum got it for me a few years ago,\u201d he says. But he notices the drawbacks of the older equipment during class presentations. While the university allows students to borrow newer and more sophisticated gear for a couple of days at a time, Theo says the short loan times are not enough to teach himself how to use the technology properly, let alone incorporate that understanding into his creative vision. \u201cLots of times I look at the other students\u2019 photos and think, compositionally, we\u2019re on the same level, but the quality of the images is a lot, lot better than mine,\u201d he says. Cathi Olivieri says she sees the effect of cost-of-living pressures play out for her music students, too. The Victorian Music Teachers\u2019 Association recommends teachers charge $89 an hour for private music lessons. A student taking weekly individual lessons over a school year would be paying about $3,500. \u201cI have had students quit due to financial stressors and not being able to afford lessons any more. I\u2019ve still got some and I\u2019m so grateful for them and their parents, because music is a therapeutic pursuit,\u201d she says. But the financial pressure goes both ways. \u201cWhen times are tough it really does help you to listen to it, make it, learn it \u2013 and for me to teach it. But it\u2019s not very rewarding financially.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Many Australians have watched their lives shrink in size and lose its colour, a direct consequence of the rising cost of living</p><p>For Cathi Olivieri, giving up on music would be like giving up on life.

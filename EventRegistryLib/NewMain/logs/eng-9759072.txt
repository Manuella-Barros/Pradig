Her initial list includes nearly a dozen names", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris is beginning to vet about a dozen possible candidates to be her running mate, according to two people familiar with the matter, as she approaches one of the most consequential decisions of her new presidential candidacy.\n\nHarris launched her campaign Sunday after President Joe Biden bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside, leaving a historically compressed timeline for her to make a selection before next month's Democratic National Convention. Her party could make her its nominee as soon as Aug. 1 in a virtual vote, and could formalize the nomination of her running mate soon after.\n\nHarris' goal, according to people with knowledge of the matter, is to keep the process drama-free, as she and Democrats try to project confidence after an extraordinarily tumultuous few weeks for the party.\n\nWhile much of the political conversation has centered on four names -- Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper -- Harris' team has requested information from about a dozen officials, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the confidential process.\n\nThe broader list includes Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. At least one of those being vetted is not currently in government.\n\nInitial requests for information went out Tuesday, one of the people said.\n\nShapiro, who on Tuesday said he had not received any requests for vetting material, was less categorical Wednesday. He referred questions about the process to Harris' campaign team.\n\nEric Holder, the former U.S. attorney general, and a team of lawyers at his firm Covington & Burling are taking the lead on vetting potential choices.

It Excludes One Key Name", "body": "Vice President and likely Democratic Presidential Nominee Kamala Harris' campaign began vetting potential running mates Monday night, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nHarris' campaign requested vetting materials from six candidates, according to the outlet's White House reporter, Mark Thomas. He posted that the candidates for the Democratic ticket who have been approached are Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly.\n\nThe campaign's reported shortlist excludes one notable name that was floated as a potential partner for the Vice President. Democrat Kentucky governor Andy Beshear told CNN he is not undergoing vetting at this time, according to Thomas. The governor's ability to win in this ruby-red state twice and potential midwestern appeal made him seem like a prime candidate, but it does not appear that the Harris campaign will tap him. Beshear won his first election in 2019 by .4% and expanded his margin of victory to 5% during his 2023 reelection campaign. (FLASHBACK: Kamala Harris Repeatedly Lied To America About Biden's Cognitive Decline)\n\nThere is a key theme among the candidates: governors from the Midwest and Sunbelt. Kelly is the only non-governor on the list but is from Arizona, a key Sunbelt swing state.\n\nIt was reported by The Hill before Biden dropped out that Whitmer and Democrat California Governor Gavin Newsom, two Democratic stars, were not interested in serving as the party's Vice Presidential nominee on a Harris-led ticket, according to a source familiar with the potential candidates. This new report could signal a change in tone from Whitmer's camp, but the vetting could also be a long-shot play by the Harris campaign to pull in the governor and her home state's 15 electoral votes. Shapiro and Kelly are currently believed to be leading the race for the nod, according to ABC News.", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Andy Beshear in Frankfort, Ky., July 22, 2024. (AP Photo)\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is beginning to vet about a dozen possible candidates to be her running mate, according to two people familiar with the matter, as she approaches one of the most consequential decisions of her new presidential candidacy.\n\nHarris launched her campaign Sunday after President Joe Biden bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside, leaving a historically compressed timeline for her to make a selection before next month's Democratic National Convention. Her party could make her its nominee as soon as Aug. 1 in a virtual vote, and could formalize the nomination of her running mate soon after.\n\nHarris' goal, according to people with knowledge of the matter, is to keep the process drama-free, as she and Democrats try to project confidence after an extraordinarily tumultuous few weeks for the party.\n\nWhile much of the political conversation has centered on four names -- Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper -- Harris' team has requested information from about a dozen officials, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the confidential process.\n\nThe broader list includes Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. At least one of those being vetted is not currently in government.\n\nInitial requests for information went out Tuesday, one of the people said.\n\nShapiro, who on Tuesday said he had not received any requests for vetting material, was less categorical Wednesday. He referred questions about the process to Harris' campaign team.\n\nEric Holder, the former U.S. attorney general, and a team of lawyers at his firm Covington & Burling are taking the lead on vetting potential choices. Typically, those under consideration are asked to turn over financial records and records of past political stances and speeches, and they are asked to submit to interviews with lawyers to identify potential red flags.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfort,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfort, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfort, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Beshear, Buttigieg in running - West Hawaii Today", "body": "U.S. President Joe Biden's weekend decision to drop his reelection bid and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic candidate leaves Harris with a major, immediate decision: whom to pick as her running mate.\n\nHarris has enlisted the law firm of Eric Holder, the former attorney general, to vet possible running mates, sources told Reuters.\n\nThese are some of the top people being discussed, according to people familiar with internal policy discussions.\n\nAndy Beshear, governor, Kentucky\n\nKentucky's Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, has carved a successful political career in a heavily Republican state that voted for Republican Donald Trump by a margin of more than 25 percentage points in 2020.\n\nBeshear has touted his record of bringing jobs to Kentucky, supporting public education and expanding healthcare access. As governor, he has vetoed legislation banning abortions and gender-affirming care for transgender youth, although the vetoes were overridden by the Republican-dominated legislature.\n\nBeshear endorsed Harris on Monday, saying she could help the country \"move on to something better\" for America. Asked if he would consider the vice presidency, he told MSNBC that he loved serving his state but added: \"The only way I would consider something other than this current job is if I believed I could further help my people and to help this country.\"\n\nPete Buttigieg, US Secretary of Transportation\n\nU.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg built a strong fan base among Democratic Party voters during his 2020 primary run against both Biden and Harris, winning the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucus.\n\nSeen as a polished defender of Biden policies, Buttigieg later endorsed Biden and was picked to join the incoming administration's Cabinet in 2021. The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor also has ties in Michigan, a critical state for Democrats in November.\n\nOn Sunday, Buttigieg backed Harris' candidacy, saying \"Harris is now the right person to take up the torch, defeat Donald Trump and succeed Joe Biden ... I will do all that I can to help her win.\"\n\nRoy Cooper, governor, North Carolina\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper has won praise from Democrats for his strong focus on economic development and his ability to win relatively strong approval ratings in a politically competitive state that leans Republican and voted for Republican candidate Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020.\n\n\"If you want a nominee who can put Donald Trump's destruction of Roe at center stage, if you want a nominee who actuwlike Donald Trump, and if you want a nominee who can put Trump's age and fitness in the forefront, Kamala Harris is the person,\" Cooper told MSNBC on Monday, one day after speaking with Harris and announcing his endorsement.\n\nMark Kelly, senator, Arizona\n\nU.S. Senator Mark Kelly is liked among Democratic Party elites for striking a relatively moderate tone in a hotly contested state that traditionally has favored Republicans, but which Biden won in 2020. A former U.S. Navy captain and astronaut, Kelly is also the husband of former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting. Gun violence is a major campaign issue for Democrats.\n\n\"I couldn't be more confident that Vice President @KamalaHarris is the right person to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country into the future. She has my support for the nomination, and Gabby and I will do everything we can to elect her President of the United States,\" Kelly wrote in an X post on Sunday, referring to his wife.\n\nJosh Shapiro, governor, Pennsylvania\n\nJosh Shapiro, Pennsylvania's governor, took office just last year but is already seen as a rising star for the party nationally. Trained as a lawyer, Shapiro served as the state's attorney general, a legal background that is similar to Harris' own as a prosecutor. He has a long history of winning elections against Republicans in a state that Democrats believe they must win to secure the election in November.\n\nShapiro and Harris spoke on Sunday, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\n\"I've known Kamala Harris for nearly two decades - we've both been prosecutors, we've both stood up for the rule of law, we've both fought for the people and delivered results. Kamala Harris is a patriot worthy of our support,\" he said in a statement on Sunday, adding that she would \"perfect our union, protect democracy and advance real freedom.\"\n\nJ.B. Pritzker, governor, Illinois\n\nBillionaire Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has proven a major force in the party, tapping his own financial resources linked to Hyatt Hotels to help Biden's campaign effort and to stand up the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. While Illinois leans heavily Democratic, neighboring Wisconsin is one of the biggest prizes in the 2024 election.\n\nEndorsing Harris on Monday, Pritzker said the two had spoken and that he felt it was important for the U.S. to elect a woman as president.\n\n\"Harris has proven, at every point in her career, that she possesses the skills, strength, and character to lead this country and the vision to better the lives of all Americans... she represents our party's best chance to defeat Donald Trump,\" he said.\n\nTim Walz, governor, Minnesota\n\nMinnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz, also would bring to the presidential ticket a record of defeating Republicans in a Midwestern state. A veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard, Walz previously represented a vast, rural and Republican-leaning district that borders the competitive state of Wisconsin in Congress.\n\n\"Thanks for the call, @KamalaHarris,\" he said on social media on Monday. \"You have my full support.\"\n\nGretchen Whitmer, governor, Michigan\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has built a strong base in the closely contested state of Michigan, running on a platform of straight talk and kitchen-table issues. She attracted Biden's attention in 2020, being vetted as a possible running mate before Biden picked Harris. She was a top supporter of and spokesperson for Biden's reelection bid.\n\nA Harris-Whitmer ticket would be the first all-woman ticket for a major U.S. political party -- a potential bonus in an election where women's reproductive rights are a top issue, if such a pairing could surmount any sexism.\n\nWhitmer endorsed Harris in a post on X on Monday and said she will serve as co-chair of Harris' campaign. She told CBS affiliate WLNS that she would not take the vice presidential post if offered it, saying \"I am not leaving Michigan.\"\n\nHarris will focus on lowering costs for Michigan voters, \"restoring their freedoms, bringing jobs and supply chains back home from overseas, and building an economy that works for working people,\" Whitmer said in a separate statement.\n\n\"We cannot let Donald Trump anywhere near the White House.

Her initial list includes nearly a dozen names", "body": "By ZEKE MILLER - AP White House Correspondent\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris is beginning to vet about a dozen possible candidates to be her running mate, according to two people familiar with the matter, as she approaches one of the most consequential decisions of her new presidential candidacy.\n\nHarris launched her campaign Sunday after President Joe Biden bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside, leaving a historically compressed timeline for her to make a selection before next month's Democratic National Convention. Her party could make her its nominee as soon as Aug. 1 in a virtual vote, and could formalize the nomination of her running mate soon after.\n\nHarris' goal, according to people with knowledge of the matter, is to keep the process drama-free, as she and Democrats try to project confidence after an extraordinarily tumultuous few weeks for the party.\n\nWhile much of the political conversation has centered on four names -- Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper -- Harris' team has requested information from about a dozen officials, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the confidential process.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe broader list includes Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. At least one of those being vetted is not currently in government.\n\nInitial requests for information went out Tuesday, one of the people said.\n\nShapiro, who on Tuesday said he had not received any requests for vetting material, was less categorical Wednesday. He referred questions about the process to Harris' campaign team.\n\nEric Holder, the former U.S. attorney general, and a team of lawyers at his firm Covington & Burling are taking the lead on vetting potential choices.

Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has developed a close relationship with Harris and has also been previously vetted and confirmed by the Senate, is also under consideration, along with Kentucky Gov.

Tony West, a former associate attorney general under Holder who is Harris' brother-in-law, is also playing a central role in the search.\n\nCNN has also learned that Democratic pollsters have been asked to test how Harris and any of the prospective candidates would fare in their home states - and key battlegrounds - in hypothetical matchups against former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nDoug Emhoff, the second gentleman who often serves as a sounding board for Harris, is also playing an unofficial role in the search, people familiar with the process say, along with other top advisers to Harris.\n\nThe truncated process means that nearly four years after Harris answered the call from Joe Biden to be his running mate - on August 11, 2020 - she intends to make a call of her own, asking one of the men on the list to join her Democratic ticket.\n\nA new CNN poll conducted by SSRS showed no clear leader in a matchup between Harris and Trump. The former president holds 49% support among registered voters nationwide to Harris' 46%, a finding within the survey's margin of sampling error. Still, that was a closer contest than earlier CNN polling this year had found about a Biden-Trump matchup.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic National Committee's rules panel on Wednesday adopted the rules the party will use to choose their presidential nominee, with voting to officially nominate Harris likely to begin August 1.

Beshear, Buttigieg in running", "body": "These are some of the top people being discussed, according to people familiar with internal policy discussions.\n\nKentucky's Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, has carved a successful political career in a heavily Republican state that voted for Republican Donald Trump by a margin of more than 25 percentage points in 2020.\n\nBeshear has touted his record of bringing jobs to Kentucky, supporting public education and expanding healthcare access. As governor, he has vetoed legislation banning abortions and gender-affirming care for transgender youth, although the vetoes were overridden by the Republican-dominated legislature.\n\nBeshear endorsed Harris on Monday, saying she could help the country \"move on to something better.\" Asked if he would consider the vice presidency, he told MSNBC that he loved serving his state but added: \"The only way I would consider something other than this current job is if I believed I could further help my people and to help this country.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg built a strong fan base among Democratic Party voters during his 2020 primary run against both Biden and Harris, winning the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucus.\n\nSeen as a polished defender of Biden policies, Buttigieg later endorsed Biden and was picked to join the incoming administration's cabinet in 2021. The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, also has ties in Michigan, a critical state for Democrats in November.\n\nOn Sunday, Buttigieg backed Harris' candidacy, saying, \"Harris is now the right person to take up the torch, defeat Donald Trump and succeed Joe Biden ... I will do all that I can to help her win.\"\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper has won praise from Democrats for his strong focus on economic development and his ability to win relatively strong approval ratings in a politically competitive state that leans Republican and voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020.\n\n\"If you want a nominee who can put Donald Trump's destruction of Roe at center stage, if you want a nominee who actually prosecuted criminals like Donald Trump, and if you want a nominee who can put Trump's age and fitness in the forefront, Kamala Harris is the person,\" Cooper told MSNBC on Monday, one day after speaking with Harris and announcing his endorsement. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade abortion rights in 2022.\n\nU.S. Senator Mark Kelly is liked among Democratic Party elites for striking a relatively moderate tone in a hotly contested state that traditionally has favored Republicans, but which Biden won in 2020. A former U.S. Navy captain and astronaut, Kelly is also the husband of former U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting. Gun violence is a major campaign issue for Democrats.\n\n\"I couldn't be more confident that Vice President @KamalaHarris is the right person to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country into the future. She has my support for the nomination, and Gabby and I will do everything we can to elect her President of the United States,\" Kelly wrote in a social media post on Sunday, referring to his wife.\n\nBest known as the commander of the military raid in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, Retired U.S. Navy Admiral William McRaven stands out as the major figure from outside of politics believed to be making the short list.\n\nHis extensive experience on national security issues included directing coordinating special operations with NATO and Washington's European allies, as well as running strategic planning for counterterrorism efforts at the White House National Security Council.\n\nAfter leaving government, he served as chancellor of the University of Texas System and was critical of the Biden administration's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. He has also been critical of Trump.\n\n\"I have been a vocal critic of the former president, but I took no joy in seeing him found guilty,\" McRaven wrote in June after Trump was convicted in New York of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. \"If we are going to continue to be viewed as exceptional, then it is time for both sides to lay down their rhetorical arms and find a way to rise above.\"\n\nJosh Shapiro, Pennsylvania's governor, took office just last year but is already seen as a rising national star for the party. Trained as a lawyer, Shapiro served as the state's attorney general, a legal background similar to Harris' own as a prosecutor. He has a history of winning elections against Republicans in a state that Democrats believe they must win to secure the election in November.\n\nShapiro and Harris spoke on Sunday, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\n\"I've known Kamala Harris for nearly two decades - we've both been prosecutors, we've both stood up for the rule of law, we've both fought for the people and delivered results. Kamala Harris is a patriot worthy of our support,\" he said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nBillionaire Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has proven a major force in the party, tapping his own financial resources linked to Hyatt Hotels to help Biden's campaign effort and to support the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. While Illinois leans heavily Democratic, neighboring Wisconsin is one of the biggest prizes in the 2024 election.\n\nEndorsing Harris on Monday, Pritzker said the two had spoken and that he felt it was important for the U.S. to elect a woman as president.\n\n\"Harris has proven, at every point in her career, that she possesses the skills, strength, and character to lead this country and the vision to better the lives of all Americans ... she represents our party's best chance to defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nMinnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz, also would bring to the presidential ticket a record of defeating Republicans in a Midwestern state. A veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard, Walz previously represented in Congress a vast, rural and Republican-leaning district.\n\n\"Thanks for the call, @KamalaHarris,\" he said on social media on Monday. \"You have my full support.\"\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has built a strong base in the closely contested state of Michigan, running on a platform of straight talk and kitchen-table issues. She attracted Biden's attention in 2020, being vetted as a possible running mate before Biden picked Harris. She was a top supporter of and spokesperson for Biden's reelection bid.\n\nA Harris-Whitmer ticket would be the first all-woman ticket for a major U.S. political party -- a potential bonus in an election where women's reproductive rights are a top issue, if such a pairing could surmount any sexism.\n\nWhitmer endorsed Harris in a social media post on Monday and said she will serve as co-chair of Harris' campaign. She told CBS affiliate WLNS that she would not take the vice presidential post if offered, saying \"I am not leaving Michigan.\"\n\nHarris will focus on lowering costs for Michigan voters, \"restoring their freedoms, bringing jobs and supply chains back home from overseas, and building an economy that works for working people,\" Whitmer said in a separate statement.\n\n\"We cannot let Donald Trump anywhere near the White House. Let's go!\"\n\n(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Nandita Bose in Washington; additional reporting by Jasper Ward and Susan Heavey; Editing by Deepa Babington, Stephen Coates and Matthew Lewis)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_caucuses", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa caucuses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._McRaven", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William H.

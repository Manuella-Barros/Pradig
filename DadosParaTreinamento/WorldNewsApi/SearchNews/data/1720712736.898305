Speaking to reporters as he arrived into the RDS this afternoon, Harris said the story today is about the \u201cabsolute collapse of support for Sinn F\u00e9in\u201d. \u201cWhat Sinn F\u00e9in need to realise here is that the Irish people see through the noise,\u201d he told the media. \u201cThe Irish people don\u2019t believe they live in a failed state. The Irish people don\u2019t believe in all of the negativity,\u201d he added, stating that the public what \u201dpragmatic delivery\u201d. \u201cThe Irish people do want change. They want credible change. That\u2019s the sort of change I\u2019m offering with Fine Gael and with our coalition colleagues,\u201d he said. Earlier today, the Sinn F\u00e9in party leader conceded that it had not been a good day for her party, and while they did make gains, it is not to the extent as was expected. Early indications from the ongoing counts of European and local elections suggest that Government parties do not appear to have suffered a major electoral blow, which had been predicted. \u2018Public didn\u2019t buy what SF were selling\u2019 \u201cThis is is the second local elections that Mary Lou McDonald has had the honor of leading her party into. It\u2019s the second local elections that have been an unmitigated disaster for them,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the people knew exactly what Sinn Fein were selling, and they just didn\u2019t want to buy it,\u201d said Harris. When asked about comments made by Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Daithi Doolin yesterday, where he said Fine Gael was \u201cobsessed\u201d with Sinn F\u00e9in, Harris denied it was the case and hit back. \u201cWe are not,\u201d he said, adding Sinn F\u00e9in should have been \u201cmore obsessed\u201d with outlining detailed policies of their own. He highlighted the controversy that ensued after McDonald told The Irish Times late last year that she wanted the average house price in Dublin to be \u20ac300,000. Harris said she failed to explain how she would deliver that. McDonald said last week that the \u20ac300k reference was to an affordable housing plan that her party had come up with. \u201cIf they became more obsessed with policy detail and playing a constructive role with solutions maybe they would be in a different place,\u201d the Taoiseach told reporters. Harris also hit out at McDonald\u2019s campaign strategy, pointing out that her party\u2019s posters spoke about beginning the process of changing the government, with slogans like \u201cchange starts here\u201d. He added: That was her idea, not mine. She got her verdict. It was pointed out to the Taoiseach that local election results don\u2019t necessarily extrapolate into the same results in a general election. In 2019, Sinn F\u00e9in had a bad day in the local elections, but when it came to the general election, they had huge success. The local, European and general elections are indeed \u201cdistinct elections\u201d, he said, stating that that, for him, it is now about getting down to delivery for the people in housing, health and in particular, children with disabilities. General election With the Fine Gael not appearing to get a wallop by the electorate in this election, the talk has naturally turned to whether Harris might be tempted to cut and run and hold a general election sooner rather than later. Fine Gael Mayo TD Michael Ring said today that time for a general election is now. Outgoing MEP France Fitzgerald also said on Newstalk today that in her view, an election at the end of the year would be best. However, when asked about this, Harris said he hasn\u2019t changed his mind, and still intends this government to go full term. Regarding Fitzgerald\u2019s comments, Harris said he welcomes her advice and counsel, but he still intends the general election to be held in March 2025. When asked about whether Fine Gael might enter into a voting pact with Fianna F\u00e1il in the general election campaign, Harris said there is no plans to formalise transfer pacts. Parties shouldn\u2019t get obsessed with polls or timings of elections, he said, stating that people just want to see the government turning up to work every day and working hard to make progress.", "summary": "Taoiseach Simon Harris says the Irish people understood what Sinn F\u00e9in was selling and they didn\u2019t buy it.", "url": "https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-harris-sinn-fein-rds-6403538-Jun2024/", "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6403538/river/?height=400&version=6403730", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:50:09", "author": "View All Articles", "authors": ["View All Articles"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.45}

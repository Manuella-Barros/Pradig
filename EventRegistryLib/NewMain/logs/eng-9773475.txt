He originally planned to shoot Chapter 3 in August -- but plans are changing.\n\nOriginally, \"Horizon\" Chapter 2 was supposed to be released in theaters on August 16. It was pulled from the schedule after two weak weeks in theaters. We still do not have a new release date for \"Horizon: An American Saga -- Chapter Two.\" It is out on PVOD now and is coming to Max... at some point.\n\nAlong for the ride with Costner, Howard Kaplan and Mark Gillard also produce \"Horizon\" Chapter 2; Danny Peykoff, Robert Scannell, Armyan Bernstein, Charlie Lyons, Barry Berg, and Rod Lake executive produce.

Horizon debuted in theaters on June 28, 2024, earning just $33 million at the box office, which was a disappointing result considering its $50 million budget. Thankfully, this film is finding new life on VOD, where it was made available to rent or buy just 18 days after its premiere, shooting to the top of the charts.\n\nIt's no secret that Costner has invested a significant amount of his own money into the Horizon saga to bring the project to life, but that doesn't mean he considers it to be what many others have called a \"passion project\" for the 69-year-old star. Per AARP, Costner says that referring to it as such \"minimizes\" its impact. For him, he says it's just a \"good idea.\"\n\n\"Calling it that [a passion project] actually minimizes it. I've been passionate about a lot of things that I've done. This is a good idea about America. People came west. It's part of our legacy. I just believed in it so much that I put my money into it, but I've had that belief about everything in my life.\"\n\nHorizon 2/5\n\nHorizon centers around fictional characters and takes place in pre- and post-Civil War America, and details the exploration of the American West. Depicting a twelve-year span, the movies feature an ensemble cast portraying various characters and their experiences pioneering into new territory from their homes.\n\nRelease Date June 28, 2024 Director Kevin Costner Cast Kevin Costner , Sienna Miller , Jena Malone , Luke Wilson , Sam Worthington , Michael Rooker , Thomas Haden Church , Jamie Campbell Bower , Isabelle Fuhrman Runtime 3h 1m Main Genre Western\n\nIndeed, as Horizon isn't the first movie that Costner has poured a portion of his bank account into. He did the same with his 1990 directorial debut, Dances with Wolves. Costner helped fund the film through Tig Productions, a company he founded specifically to help bring Wolves to life, spending $3 million of his money on the production ($7 million in today's economy). Unlike Horizon, however, the 1990 blockbuster would earn a massive $424 million at the box office against its $22 million budget, and go on to earn Costner Best Picture and Best Director awards at the 63rd Academy Awards.\n\nDoes Horizons Dismal Box Office Performance Mean It's Not a Success? Close\n\nWith Horizon under performing at the box office, the future of the saga is now called into question. The second part was expected to release theatrically in August, but Territory Pictures and New Line Cinema pulled the plug on that idea in order to give more people a chance to \"discover the first installment of Horizon over the coming weeks, including on PVOD and MAX.\" Will that lead to the eventual release of Part 2 becoming a greater success than its predecessor? Perhaps, but Costner doesn't define success by box office numbers.\n\nAs Hollywood is a business, most movies are defined by their numbers, a fact that can either make or break a filmmaker and their future. Though Costner is already an established figure, he still falls under the same scrutiny as others when it comes to executives looking at the performance of his films when it comes to deciding if they want to invest in future projects. However, while the suits and ties might define success with dollar signs, Costner doesn't look at it that way. \"I think we have false gods when it comes to how we judge success,\" he said, before elaborating further.\n\n\"I understand what it's like to have a huge hit and what it does for you. And I would love for this [Horizon] to be supported, watched, shared, because I made it with that in mind. But what's success? Is it money? Is it doing what you wanted to do in life? Movies aren't just about opening weekend. Ten years later, a good movie will still be shared. Success is: Will you revisit it and show your daughter, show your son? Will you revisit it because you wonder about it, because you find new details?

Costner, in a statement, said that his \"dream\" was always to show the film at Venice.

Then the first chapter collected only $23 million in its first two weeks in theaters. In announcing the change of plans, New Line Cinema said they hoped to give more audiences more time to discover Chapter One.\n\nA passion project for more than 30 years, Costner put some of his own money into making the ambitious films, and has already begun shooting a third installment of what he envisions will ultimately be four movies.\n\n\"I'm indebted to Alberto Barbera for his courage and leadership in committing to this cinematic journey,\" Costner said. \"Long live the movies and those willing to stand for them.\"\n\nThe 81st edition of the Venice Film Festival kicks off on Aug. 28.

Boasting a bumper cast featuring Sienna Miller, Giovanni Ribisi, Sam Worthington, Jena Malone, Jamie Campbell Bower, Danny Huston, Abbey Lee, Michael Angarano, and Luke Wilson, the collection of movies is the Hollywood legend's most ambitious project to date, but has got off to a rocky start.\n\nIn total, the cost of financing the project has set Costner back $38 million, and the actor has placed everything on the line to make Horizon become a genuine film series rather than an ambitious dream. As of yet, no new date has been revealed regarding the release date of the second movie.\n\nHowever, Costner remains intent on realising his vision, and Horizon 2 is set to be shown at Venice Film Festival, which is set to run from August 28th to September 7th. Notable other movies set to premiere in Italy include Todd Phillips' Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, Luca Guadagnino's Queer and Brady Corbet's The Brutalist.\n\nAlthough Horizon 2 isn't part of the competition at Venice Film Festival, it will be shown on the final day of the two-week long cinematic event. Furthermore, earlier in the same day, the first movie in Costner's series will be shown in Venice.\n\nIn a statement, Costner shared his delight and thanked the festival for showing faith in his project, stating, \"My dream was always to show Horizon: An American Saga -- Chapter Two at the Venice Film Festival. The fact that now they have decided to show Chapter One earlier in the day and then the world premiere of Chapter Two that evening shows not only their belief in how the two films work together but their support of a director's vision. I'm indebted to Alberto Barbera for his courage and leadership in committing to this cinematic journey.\"\n\nBarbera also noted: \"It is a great pleasure and honor to host the world premiere of the chapter two of Horizon: An American Saga, alongside its chapter one.\"\n\nHe described the late addition to the line-up as \"a heartfelt and respectful tribute to the visionary project of a great actor and director\". Costner is also praised because he \"invested himself in the epic reconstruction of the years crucial to the founding of the country, digging beyond myth in search of authenticity capable of restoring a piece of history in its complex and contradictory reality.\"\n\nFollowing the earlier announcement of the film's postponement, Costner's Territory Pictures said the delay will heighten anticipation for the film and \"only serve to enhance the experience of seeing Horizon 2.\"", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_taysom@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Joe Taysom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abbey Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Angarano", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Angarano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Campbell_Bower", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Campbell Bower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Ribisi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Ribisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jena Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Huston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danny Huston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Worthington", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Worthington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sienna_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sienna Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Costner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Guadagnino", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luca Guadagnino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Corbet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brady Corbet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Barbera", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Barbera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film_Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film Festivals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2024/02/Kevin-Costner-Horizon-An-American-Saga-2024-Far-Out-Magazine-02.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773475", "eventUri": "eng-9773475", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-28", "dateEnd": "2024-09-07", "textStart": 1022, "textEnd": 1050}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

You don't work on something for over 30 years just to be stubborn, even though Costner is known for being a little stubborn.\n\nBut apparently, he does not like to admit that he has passions, aside from banana milkshakes. After fans and critics called Horizon: An American Saga Part 1 a passion project, Costner wasn't super happy.\n\n\"Calling it that actually minimizes it,\" Costner told AARP. He went on to say that he is passionate about all of his work. Does that include Yellowstone? Who knows.\n\nHe added, \"I've been passionate about a lot of things that I've done. This is a good idea about America. People came west. It's part of our legacy. I just believed in it so much that I put my money into it, but I've had that belief about everything in my life.\"\n\nSo why did it take so long? Maybe his passion died down after nobody wanted to fund the expensive franchise. \"I commissioned a script in 1988, and we kept fiddling with it and finally tried to make it in 2003. But I wanted more money than the studio was willing to pay. I was disappointed. After that I sat down with a new writer, and I became a cowriter. And we began to expand and reengineer everything,\" he explained. That's passion!\n\nHorizon: An American Saga Part 1 hit theaters earlier this summer, but due to poor reviews and a bad box office debut, Part 2 will not get a theatrical release. Good thing Costner doesn't care! He said, \"Movies aren't just about opening weekend. Ten years later, a good movie will still be shared. Success is: Will you revisit it and show your daughter, show your son? Will you revisit it because you wonder about it, because you find new details?

The news comes three weeks after it was announced the film would not get a theatrical release as planned.\n\nIn a statement to the Hollywood Reporter, Costner said he's \"indebted\" to Venice Film Fest director Alberto Barbera \"for his courage and leadership in committing to this cinematic journey. It is with gratitude and excitement that I return to the Venice Film Festival. Long live the movies and those willing to stand for them.\"\n\nAfter Chapter 1 underperformed in theaters in June, the actor's production company, Territory Pictures, alongside distributor New Line Cinema decided to pull the western movie from the calendar.\n\nOriginally set for an Aug. 16 release, Chapter 2 of Costner's take on westward expansion during the Civil War era was put on hold, THR reported earlier this month, \"in order to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover\" Chapter 1, which opened in theaters June 28.\n\nWhile Coster's epic made a splashy debut at the Cannes Film Festival in May, garnering a seven-minute standing ovation, the film earned only $11 million in its opening weekend after receiving mixed reviews from critics.\n\nTo help finance the pricey saga, starring Sienna Miller and Sam Worthington alongside Costner, the actor and producer mortgaged his beachfront home near Santa Barbara, Calif., investing $38 million in the project. That number, however, is much lower than the actual cost of the planned four films, two of which are in various stages of production. Chapter 1 alone had a reported $100 million price tag, not including publicity and marketing.\n\nGiven the cost, box office returns were crucial for the film. But the former Yellowstone star was clear-eyed about what was at stake.\n\n\"Clearly things are at risk,\" Costner previously told Yahoo Entertainment. That said, he added, \"I don't want to lose track of what moves me and what I want to do in my life.\"\n\nThe Oscar winner added that he wasn't measuring the success of his opus solely on box office numbers.\n\n\"I think success for me is people saying, 'I saw a really good movie last night, and I know there's another one coming. I want to see it again, and I want to share it.' So sharing is a sign of something that moves you,\" he told Yahoo.\n\nWhile Costner hasn't released a statement, he took to his Instagram Stories on Wednesday to pay tribute to the 39th anniversary of his film Silverado and said he hoped his new film, Horizon, is \"stirring hearts the way this movie has stirred mine for nearly four decades.\"\n\nWhen part one was released on the big screen, some movie theaters offered audiences the chance to buy tickets for the first and second installments -- a so-called passport -- for discounted pricing on the two-parter.\n\nFor theatergoers who have already purchased advanced tickets to Horizon: An American Saga -- Chapter 2, their purchases will be refunded, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nWhile the second installment of Horizon will not be released in theaters on Aug. 16, Costner and his film partners still intend to release the film theatrically on an as-yet-undisclosed date, per the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nA New Line Cinema spokesperson told the outlet that the decision was to give audiences more time to catch Chapter 1 in theaters but also on other platforms, including premium video on demand (PVOD) and streaming service Max.\n\n\"The support that we have received from film fans, and the theater owners, as they experience the first chapter of this saga only serves to reinforce our belief in them and the films that we have made, and we thank them for coming on board for the ride. We welcome the opportunity for that window to be expanded as we know it will only serve to enhance the experience of seeing Horizon 2,\" the spokesperson said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Costner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venice Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Line_Cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Line Cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Production company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yellowstone (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Worthington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Worthington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sienna_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sienna Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_ovation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Standing ovation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4TWL0isYFk.TULjT4RaIUw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NDg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/4fdd7390-178f-11ef-bbfe-e85d8bbbcb7a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773475", "eventUri": "eng-9773475", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-16", "textStart": 798, "textEnd": 805, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 1039, "textEnd": 1046}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

It is with gratitude and excitement that I return to the Venice Film Festival. Long live the movies and those willing to stand for them.\"\n\nBefore the announcement, \"Horizon 2\" was withdrawn from theatrical release in August. The decision was made jointly by Costner's production company, Territory Pictures, and distribution partner, New Line Cinema.\n\nAccording to THR, they aim to attract a larger audience before possibly attempting a theatrical release, a move seemingly inspired by the poor performance of \"Horizon 1\" in cinemas.\n\nAs part of their plans, they released \"Horizon 1\" as a PVOD (Premium Video on Demand) version and will debut it on the streaming service MAX.\n\n\"Territory Pictures and New Line Cinema have decided not to release Horizon: Chapter 2 on August 16 in order to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of Horizon over the coming weeks, including on PVOD and Max,\" a spokesperson for the film's distribution partner said in a statement.\n\nThey added, \"We thank our exhibition partners for their continued support as moviegoers across the U.S. discover the film in its theatrical run.\"\n\nIn May, \"Horizon 1\" received a ten-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival, setting the stage for what was hoped to be a massive debut in the theaters in June.\n\nHowever, critics piled on the three-hour epic after the film festival, with some even calling it the \"dullest cinematic vanity project of the century,\" per THR.\n\nFollowing the backlash, it was no surprise that the film performed underwhelmingly during its opening weekend, earning a meager $11 million.\n\nBy its second weekend, the film's earnings fell by another 51 percent to bring in $5.4 million and a 10-day domestic total of $22 million. Overall, it grossed less than half its $100 million budget in its theatre run.\n\nDespite the poor performance of \"Horizon 1\" and the removal of \"Horizon 2\" from the August theatrical calendar, Costner seems already invested in producing chapters three and four of the franchise.\n\nDuring an interview in May, he hinted that he would proceed with the production of his films even if \"Horizon 1\" did not receive much viewership.\n\nHe said at the time, per Deadline, \"Well, the reality of that is the film lives and whatever are the viewing habits. I own it for the rest of its life. And every five years, license them around the world. Relicense them here in America.\"\n\n\"The difference is I own that because of the risk I've taken,\" Costner continued. \"Why is Vegas there? It's for all the people that lose to the house. Why are studios there? It's because those movies continue to make money, well beyond their opening weekends.\"\n\nIn the meantime, no announcement has been made regarding the theatrical release date for \"Horizon 2.\" Additionally, Warner Bros. and New Line did not acquire distribution rights for the third and fourth movies, which suggests Costner may have to seek other partners.\n\nAccording to Radar Online, Costner's bold move to invest personal funds in his $100 million, four-film project, \"Horizon: An American Saga,\" has put his lavish Santa Barbara estate at risk.\n\nThe poor performance of \"Horizon 1\" allegedly cast a shadow over the entire project and threatened Costner's prized estate.\n\nNow, sources close to the 69-year-old actor claim that he ignored multiple warnings against using his funds and ended up pouring $38 million of his savings into the project.\n\nAn insider said: \"Kevin could be wiped out by this disaster. Everyone warned him not to invest his own money, but he ignored the advice and ended up sinking $38 million of his own cash into it.

Not only did the first chapter of the four-part saga utterly flop at the box office, but it is going down in history as one of the first major film franchises to go to the modern-day version of video: streaming.\n\nThe movie opened on June 28 and is already being pulled from most theaters, according to Forbes. \"Horizon\" finishes up its run at No. 10 in the box office, after failing to compete with summer blockbusters like \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\"\n\nAt first, it appeared that no one wanted to go to the movies during the thick of summer, leading to Costner's failure with this first movie. But since \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" just grossed an estimated $205 million in ticket sales during its opening weekend, the problem is probably the subject matter itself.\n\n\"Horizon\" barely dragged in $28.8 million in the U.S. and just $2.1 million internationally.(RELATED: Taylor Sheridan Is Casting For 'Lioness' ...

Continue to check back with us as we will be adding more information as it becomes available.\n\nSummary\n\nHorizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2 will debut at the Venice Film Festival on September 7 after the movie was pulled from its initial August 16 theatrical release date. Chapter 1 performed poorly at the box office, leading to Chapter 2 getting pulled from its release date. It's unclear for now when a theatrical release will arrive.\n\nKevin Costner's Western epic Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2 has confirmed a new premiere date after the sequel's original August release plans were canceled. Horizon Chapter 2's release was originally set for August 16, 2024, before the poor performance of Chapter 1 at the box office led to it being pulled from its initial release date. The initial installment in the planned four-part saga has earned only $33.2 million at the box office against a $50 million budget, making it a financial flop.\n\nNow, La Biennale di Venezia has confirmed that Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2 will make its debut at the 81st Venice Film Festival on September 7, following the film getting pulled from its initial August release. The announcement was accompanied by a statement from Costner, grateful for the opportunity to screen the movie, hoping it's able to showcase the vision he has for the Western story overall. Check out what Costner had to say below:\n\nMy dream was always to show Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter Two at the Venice Film Festival. The fact that now they have decided to show Chapter One earlier in the day and then the World Premiere of Chapter Two that evening shows not only their belief in how the two films work together but their support of a director's vision. I'm indebted to Alberto Barbera for his courage and leadership in committing to this cinematic journey. It is with gratitude and excitement that I return to the Venice Film Festival. Long live the movies and those willing to stand for them.\n\nMore to come...\n\nSource: La Biennale di Venezia", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_bythrow@screenrant.com", "name": "Nick Bythrow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Costner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fast_and_the_Furious", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Fast and the Furious"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin_Diesel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vin Diesel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venice Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/81st_Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "81st Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Biennale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venice Biennale"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film_Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film Festivals", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Organizations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kevin-costner-as-hayes-in-horizon-an-american-saga-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773475", "eventUri": "eng-9773475", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-07", "textStart": 531, "textEnd": 542, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-16", "textStart": 587, "textEnd": 596}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-08-", "textStart": 1004, "textEnd": 1013}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

And yes, this is the project that a mortgage on his Padaro Lane compound has allegedly built.\n\nDespite rumors of a flop-in-the-making, the truth (at least to my sensibilities) is that Costner has created a wobbly but noble effort in the interest of expanding the well-trodden and often clich\u00e9-prone Western genre. Ironically, big screen prospects are often sacrificed at the altar of small screen thinking: as seen on TV, watered-down and stretched-out dramatics -- not to mention the coarse ditching of its episodic tapestry -- mimic the foibles of prestige television tactics. It is also possible now to watch Chapter 1 in the comforts of our streaming-equipped living rooms, where we can pause for the refreshment of a visit to the urination station or another slug o' whiskey.\n\nTV-centrism notwithstanding, Costner uses the format to admirably touch on multiple, contrary perspectives in the story of how the West was \"won\" -- and, for indigenous peoples, tragically lost. Dramatic bullet points include a brutal Apache attack on a village of hopeful Manifest Destiny-powered settlers/invaders, sympathetic scenes of indigenous communities fearing the loss of their ancient lifestyles (spoken in dialect, with English subtitles), scalp hunters and mercenaries, sagely elders and wisdom-spewing military men, a roving wagon train microcosm.\n\nAnd, of course, we have Costner's taciturn tough guy hero in one of the many spotlights.\n\nHere, Costner plays the mysterious, laconic gunslinger with some ornery backstory we're not yet privy to in the series. He speaks softly through a half-clenched jaw but is a sure shot when the time comes, and he beds down with a woman half his age. That kind of guy. From the indigenous quarters, peace-seeking tribal members clash with righteously indignant young warriors, while a weary elder warily blesses his battle-ready sons, reasons \"I'm glad my sons know who they are.\"\n\nPulled hypnotically into the concentric energies of this first saga's multiple plot lines, abruptly we are flung into a mad montage of scenes to come when next we visit Horizon, with the release of Chapter 2 in August. As a pleasing final touch, over the end credits, a version of that trusty Americana anthem \"Amazing Grace\" is sung both in English and indigenous dialect.\n\nAs for Horizon's place in the vast pantheon of films in the western genre, it's good as many and better and more inclusive and ambitious than some.

He rose to stardom playing a variety of different characters in movies that touched base with multiple genres, but one film became the genesis point for everything that followed.\n\nAdmittedly, it took him a while to embrace what couldn't have been anything other than destiny, but looking back on his efforts on either side of the camera, it's clear a formative experience moulded him in ways he couldn't have possibly imagined at the time.\n\nStrangely, though, Costner didn't appear in a western until the 11th feature of his career, when he exuded effortless charm as part of the ensemble cast Lawrence Kasdan assembled for Silverado in 1985. He wouldn't make another one until eight years later when he was already a superstar, but it was nonetheless a case of one hand feeding the other, potentially even on a subconscious level.\n\nBetween those two points, Costner cracked the A-list after anchoring conspiracy thriller No Way Out, crime classic The Untouchables, and smash hit sports flicks Bull Durham and Field of Dreams. When it came time to make his directorial debut, however, there was only one form of cinema at the forefront of his mind.\n\nInvesting millions of his own dollars into the production, his faith was rewarded handsomely when Dances with Wolves became the highest-grossing western in history, winning seven Academy Awards, including 'Best Picture' and 'Best Director'. The wide-open vistas had been very kind to him, but it was a relationship that would continually seesaw back and forth.\n\nHe once again funnelled his own cash into Waterworld, which wasn't exactly dissimilar to a post-apocalyptic western, with Costner playing the wandering hero. The Postman was an unmitigated disaster that took both of those aforementioned tropes one step further, doing severe damage to his career in the process.\n\nHis next directorial vehicle after that? Open Range, a western. A Golden Globe-winning performance that reminded audiences of what he could do after more than a decade in the wilderness? It came in Hatfield & McCoys, another western. The role that lit the touchpaper on his comeback? Yellowstone, basically a modern western. His incredibly risky passion project he's been dreaming of for decades that finally came to fruition? Horizon: An American Saga, a western.\n\nSuffice to say, Costner loves himself a western, and that adoration was instilled at a very early age. \"I guess my first real impact in a movie theatre was with How the West Was Won,\" he admitted to Roger Ebert, before explaining the knock-on effect. \"And then later I saw Red River and The Searchers. It appeals to me. It's not as simple as I think people make it out to be.\"\n\nIn terms of having his eyes opened to the complexities of the western, the star-studded 1962 epic was one way of going about it. Boasting genre icons Henry Hathaway and John Ford among its directors, the cast was equally esteemed with James Stewart, Lee Van Cleef, Gregory Peck, George Peppard, Henry Fonda, Richard Widmark, Eli Wallach, and 'The Duke' himself John Wayne all appearing on-screen.\n\nIt's not the sort of thing that can be written off as a coincidence, with Costner having enjoyed his greatest successes and most disastrous lows in the genre. The western may have been equal parts cruel and kind to him over the years in a number of different ways, but a straight line can nonetheless be drawn between the wide-eyed kid who sat in awe of How the West Was Won and the industry veteran who shrugged off concerns he was in danger of committing career suicide for a second time when he felt the four-part Horizon series was something he couldn't forgive himself for not doing.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_campbell@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Scott

The world premiere will be preceded earlier the same day by a screening of the first \"Horizon\" movie, which launched from Cannes in May to a seven-minute standing ovation.\n\nIn Variety's review of the first film, chief film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote: \"Instead of unfurling a Western saga in a solid powerful arc, Costner serves up three hours of anecdotes, cross-cutting among groups of characters, dropping in on situations that are dropped just as quickly, taking a skittery overview of life on the range, and asking the audience, in many cases, to stitch together the backstory of what they're seeing.\"\n\nNew Line Cinema's \"Horizon: An American Saga\" is a multi-faceted depiction of the Civil War expansion and settlement of the American West. In addition to directing and starring, Costner served as a co-writer with Jon Baird (\"The Explorers Guild\") and produced through his Territory Pictures.\n\n\"My dream was always to show 'Horizon: An American Saga -- Chapter Two' at the Venice Film Festival,\" Costner said in a statement. \"The fact that now they have decided to show 'Chapter One' earlier in the day and then the world premiere of 'Chapter' Two that evening shows not only their belief in how the two films work together but their support of a director's vision. I'm indebted to Alberto Barbera for his courage and leadership in committing to this cinematic journey.\"\n\nAdded Barbera: \"It is a great pleasure and honor to host the world premiere of the chapter two of 'Horizon: An American Saga,' alongside its chapter one. This late addition to the lineup of the Venice Film Festival pays a heartfelt and respectful tribute to the visionary project of a great actor and director, who invested himself in the epic reconstruction of the years crucial to the founding of the country, digging beyond myth in search of authenticity capable of restoring a piece of history in its complex and contradictory reality.\"\n\nThe 81st edition of the Venice Film Festival will run Aug. 28-Sept. 7.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saga"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Venice Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jena Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Huston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danny Huston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Worthington", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Worthington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sienna_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sienna Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Costner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lido_di_Venezia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lido di Venezia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lido di Venezia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Gleiberman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Owen Gleiberman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Line_Cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Line Cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_ovation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Standing ovation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_criticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film criticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cannes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/81st_Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "81st Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Barbera", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Barbera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exploration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film_Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film Festivals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDHOAN_WB049.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773475", "eventUri": "eng-9773475", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-28", "dateEnd": "2024-09-07", "textStart": 2560, "textEnd": 2575}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-16", "textStart": 244, "textEnd": 251}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-07", "textStart": 575, "textEnd": 582}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

They say, 'Why would he mention Hannibal Lecter? He must be cognitively in trouble.' No. These are real stories. Hannibal Lecter from 'Silence of the Lamb,' is a lovely man. He wants to have you for dinner,\" he said.\n\nTrump has mentioned the character several times before during speeches.\n\nDuring a rally in New Jersey in May, he said, \"'Silence of the Lambs.' Has anyone ever seen 'The Silence of the Lambs'? The late, great Hannibal Lecter is a wonderful man.\"\n\nOn more than one occasion, he appears to pivot from speaking about immigration to talking about Hanibal Lecter, who was held in a psychiatric hospital, leading some critics to suggest he may be conflating asylum seekers with what he's referred to as \"insane asylums.\"\n\n\"They're coming from prisons, they're coming from jails, they're coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. You know the press is always on me cause I say this. Has anyone seen 'Silence of the Lambs'?\" said Trump during his Republican National Committee (RNC speech on July 19.\n\nTrump's critics -- including President Biden -- have mocked him for speaking about the character as though he were a real person.\n\n\"Donald, Hannibal Lecter is not real,\" Biden wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on July 20 along with a clip of Trump's RNC speech.\n\nThe character of Hannibal Lecter was created by writer Thomas Harris, whose novel about the relationship between psychiatrist Lecter and FBI agent Clarice Starling was published in 1988. The most famous portrayal was delivered by Sir Anthony Hopkins in 1991 movie adaptation.\n\nHopkins reacted to Trump's praising words of Hannibal in an interview with Deadlinepublished July 16, saying he wasn't aware the former president had developed an interest in the character.\n\n\"God, that was over 30 years ago. I'm shocked and appalled what you've told me about Trump,\" said Hopkins.\n\nDespite the criticism, his supporters' positive reaction at events may be a reason for Trump to repeat the reference.\n\n\"Nearly everything Trump does is done for attention. It has driven him his whole career, whether in business or politics. He tests out lines on his crowds. If they get a good response, he keeps them in,\" Dr Andrew Wroe, senior lecturer in American politics at the University of Kent, told Newsweek.\n\nSince President Joe Biden, 81, pulled out of the 2024 race, Trump has faced growing concerns over his age and ability to spend another four years in office. Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has seen a surge of support, both among her party and voters at large, according to recent polls.\n\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

Anthony Hopkins is 'appalled' while everyone else remains confused ...\n\nIf the rumours are true, and Donald Trump really is becoming increasingly displeased with his choice of running mate, JD Vance, then it can only be a matter of time before he replaces him. And when he does, there is only one figure that he can possibly choose. A figure with a clinical mind. A figure with a sharkish ruthlessness. The figure who haunts Trump's every waking thought. The overwhelming object of his obsession. That's right: Trump's next VP pick has to be the late, great Hannibal Lecter.\n\nTrump mentioned Hannibal Lecter again last night, during a rally in North Carolina. During a rambling tangent about immigrants, Trump said: \"They're coming from everywhere. They're coming from all over the world, from prisons and jails, and mental institutions and insane asylums. You know, they go crazy when I say, 'The late great Hannibal Lecter,' OK? They say, 'Why would he mention Hannibal Lecter? He must be cognitively in trouble.' No no no, these are real stories. Hannibal Lecter from Silence of the Lambs. He's a lovely man. He'd love to have you for dinner.\"\n\nIf that sounds familiar, it's because Trump said more or less the same thing during his speech at the Republican national convention last week. And several times before that, stretching all the way back to May. Indeed, Lecter has become as immovable a part of Trump's campaign as the poem The Snake was back in 2016. Only that made sense because, as a poem, The Snake is a collection of words that possesses a basic legibility. Whereas the Hannibal thing literally cannot be described as that at all.\n\nTrump's unending Hannibal references are so overwhelmingly confusing that it has sent the internet running to the hills in search of something, anything, that might explain why the next potential president of the world's biggest superpower keeps repeating the same baffling non-sequitur every time he gets near a microphone. People even approached Anthony Hopkins in an effort to get to the bottom of it. And without luck, because all Hopkins could manage in response was a brief (if understandable) \"I'm shocked and appalled\".\n\nSo, then. What on earth is going on? Let's try to get to the bottom of this by going through the prevalent theories.\n\nAccording to TikTok user MrsMisanthrope2, Trump only evokes Hannibal Lecter in public whenever he has been discussing immigrants. Immigrants seek asylum. And where do we first meet Lecter in Silence of the Lambs? That's right, in an insane asylum. The theory goes that Donald Trump believes the word \"asylum\" only has one definition, and that everyone who seeks asylum is automatically by definition insane. This could also be reinforced by the fact that, in 2001's Hannibal, Lecter lives in Florence and is therefore an immigrant. But this can't be right, can it? Donald Trump cannot be that stupid, can he? Can he?\n\nDonald Trump's odd phrasing when he mentions Lecter has baffled some, not least because it's never made explicitly clear whether Trump thinks that Lecter is alive or not. The repeated use of the line \"the late, great Hannibal Lecter\" seems to suggest he might be unable to discern fiction from reality. To make matters worse, Hannibal Lecter isn't actually dead. He remained alive through all the Silence of the Lambs prequels, and basically won in Hannibal, and even though the final episode of the Hannibal TV show ended with Lecter toppling off a cliff into the sea, his fate was left deliberately vague. But he can't think Lecter is real, because once he mentioned that he was a character from a movie. So what is it?\n\nNotice that Trump never mentions Lecter without saying something along the lines of \"He'd love to have you for dinner\". Could this be the reason for all the references? Could it simply be that it means he gets an easy laugh from a crowd of simpletons with an old gag? What's more, a gag that is so thumpingly unoriginal that Hannibal Lecter literally says it out loud during Silence of the Lambs? If that's the case, this is highly upsetting and Trump should consider paraphrasing a different overused line from a film. Maybe he could spike his speeches by saying \"May the force be with you\", or \"We're gonna need a bigger boat\" or \"I could've been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am\".\n\nMaybe, though, this is all just a distraction. Maybe Trump is a political genius who knows that a newspaper of note like the Guardian will waste hundreds of words every time he mentions Hannibal Lecter, allowing him all the cover he needs to enact Project 2025 on an unwitting nation. Perhaps this is his equivalent of that time Boris Johnson said he painted wooden buses as a hobby, only more sophisticated because it has inspired debate rather than head-slapping disappointment. Perhaps invoking the name of a man from a film from 33 years ago is all part of his evil plan to destabilise all of democracy as we know it. But surely that can't be it either.\n\nWhich leaves just one explanation. \"The late great Hannibal Lecter, he's a lovely man, he'd love to have you for dinner,\" is actually a trigger sequence for an army of insurrectionist sleeper agents who have been brainwashed by Russian scientists, and once they've heard him say it 35 times they'll burn Washington to the ground.

The event was a blend of policy talk and some offbeat moments, showing off Trump's usual way of speaking and his ongoing clash with critics. Early in the speech, Trump abruptly shifted gears while discussing inflation. \"As vice president, [Harris] cast the tie-breaking votes that created the worst inflation in a half a century, decimating middle-class families and hurting very badly as you know all people in North Carolina, and by the way, Lara says hello,\" he said.\n\nThis sudden mention of his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, led to an unexpected defense of his cognitive abilities. \"Lara. Do we love Lara? How good is Lara? She is terrific,\" Trump continued. He then explained his reasoning for the seemingly random shoutout: \"I had to mention her at that point because if I forget it later on they'll say 'He's cognitively challenged.' I don't want to be cognitively, no, but I want to thank her because she's unbelievable.\"\n\nThis wasn't the only time Trump broached the subject of his mental acuity during the rally. Later in his speech, he revisited the topic while discussing immigration, veering into a bizarre comparison involving the fictional character Hannibal Lecter. \"They go crazy when I say 'The late great Hannibal Lecter,' OK. They say 'Why would he mention Hannibal Lecter, he must be cognitively in trouble,'\" Trump said. He then added, \"No, no, no. These are real stories, Hannibal Lecter from 'Silence of the Lambs,' he's a lovely man he wants to have you for dinner he'd like to have you for dinner.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that Trump often brings up Lecter at his rallies. The ex-president has talked about the fictional cannibal quite a few times. In a rally back in May, he even called Lecter a 'wonderful man.' Then in June, he told his supporters not to 'hang out' with the character, as per The Mediaite.\n\nWhen it comes to Trump's alleged cognitive dissonance, author Ramin Setoodeh recently said that Trump showed 'severe memory issues' during interviews. Business leaders who met with him also said his speech was 'meandering' and lacked coherence. However, even with these worries, Trump and his team say he's in good health. But things like confusing former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley with Nancy Pelosi earlier this year have kept people talking about his mental sharpness.\n\nAnother instance is when, at a rally in Charlotte, Trump gave Vice President Kamala Harris a new nickname, calling her \"Lyin' Kamala Harris,\" according to The Daily Mail. He also kept mispronouncing her first name and accused Democratic Party leaders of pushing President Joe Biden out of the race. Trump said, \"The leaders of the Democrat Party -- in a very un-democratic move -- they said 'either you get out or we're going to throw you out using the 25th Amendment.' That's what happened. You know that.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Lecter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hannibal Lecter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lara Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediaite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mediaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannibalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/707205/uploads/b31f92a0-4a73-11ef-b684-edcc0ca42050_1200_630.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761636", "eventUri": "eng-9761636", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

First, I had a meeting with Congress, Republican Congress. It was like a lovefest. Then, I met with them and the US Senate, which was all Republicans, 49. And it was also a lovefest, but my best meeting of the three (sic) was with the executives. And Biden's misinformation -- people put out a thing: Oh, he went on, he rambled. There was no rambling. This, you could say, this is rambling, but in order to get to the point, you have to, you know, this is a very complex subject, that a lot of people, most people don't understand. But I just wanted to say, that that was the best meeting. They loved it. They were happy with.\"\n\nRead Also: How is it possible Trump's habitual incoherence caught top CEOs by surprise?\n\nThe rambling comments continued as he bragged about his tax cuts in 2017.\n\n\"But I would like to get it down to 15, if we could, because that would put us in the absolute lowest in terms of incentive. But that meeting and we had, I don't know, 70 -- all CEOs, the top guys. That was a lovefest. And I will tell you when I'm not loved because I feel that better than anybody. But that was a lovefest. And it was reported by some people so wrong. Actually, CNBC called and apologized to me, because they found out. But we had a great meeting, Jamie Dimon was there. I have a lot of respect for Jamie Dimon.\"\n\nThe reporter at Bloomberg asked the question again whether Dimon would be a candidate for Treasury Secretary.\n\n\"He is somebody that I would consider, sure,\" Trump said. \"He was at the meeting. Tim Cook was right next to him. You know, we had everybody.\"\n\nIn a post on Truth Social this week, Trump denied he commented.\n\n\"I don't know who said it, or where it came from, perhaps the Radical Left, but I never discussed, or thought of, Jamie Dimon or Larry Fink for Secretary of the Treasury,\" Trump said. Fink is the CEO of the BlackRock investment firm.\n\nSignorile pointed out that Trump's forgetting the conversation he had just three weeks ago indicates a questionable \"decline.\"\n\nPsychologists duo Dr. John Gartner and Dr. Harry Segal host the podcast \"Shrinking Trump,\" which examines the mind of the 45th president. Both doctors agree that what is being seen is a mental decline.\n\nIn May, they discussed Trump's obsession with the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter to explore Trump's loss of cognition further.\n\nTrump's ramblings about Lecter began last year. In an Oct. 7, 2023 rally, in in Waterloo, Iowa, Trump told the crowd: \"Hannibal Lecter, how great an actor was he? You know why I like him? Because he said on television on one of the - 'I love Donald Trump.' So I love him. I love him. I love him. He said that a long time ago and once he said that, he was in my camp, I was in his camp.

Footage then pivots to Trump calling him, \"a wonderful man.\"\n\nTo be clear, Hannibal Lecter, the fictitious character first made famous by Hopkins in \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" is a cannibal. The scene Trump was describing at a rally earlier this year in New Jersey included Lecter literally having (read: eating) a friend for dinner. Quibbles over calling a cannibal \"great\" aside, there's also this: The fictitious character is also not \"late.\" The character hasn't been killed off in any of the Thomas Harris books, or the movie adaptations thereof.\n\nMoving on, the ad then shows a montage of gaffes or other uncomfortable moments, such as Trump being unable to drink a bottle of water; his inability to articulate the words \"anonymous,\" \"origin,\" or \"Venezuela; claiming windmill noise causes cancer (it doesn't); alleging consumers need ID to buy bread (they don't); and saying \"the kidney has a special place in the heart\" (that's not where the kidney is).\n\nThere are also references to Trump musing that injecting bleach might cure COVID, his infamous mocking of a disabled reporter and referring to Apple CEO Tim Cook as \"Tim Apple.\"\n\nThe ad then points voters to PsychoPAC.org, a website established by Conway's new super PAC, which opened last month.\n\nThe website's homepage is blunt: \"Voters have forgotten one important fact: Trump is f**king nuts.\"\n\nThe PAC had also deployed 10 billboards and mobile trucks around Milwaukee during the Republican National Convention thanking delegates for \"nominating a criminal,\" a reference to Trump's guilty verdict on 34 felonies related to hush money payments to a porn star, \"nominating a psycho\" and \"nominating a convicted felon.\"\n\nConway said the purpose of Psycho PAC is to flip the script on the mental acuity question. President Joe Biden, prior to his departure from the race, had faced serious pushback on his fitness for office, both physically and mentally due to his age. With Biden out, the path is now clear to shift that narrative onto Trump, who at 78 years old, is now the oldest nominee for President in history.\n\n\"Donald Trump wanted to make this election all about mental fitness,\" Conway said.\n\n\"We're good with that. Even before he began showing age-related cognitive decline, Trump had a long history of doing and saying bizarre things. He was never right in the head. And as he's gotten older, he's only gotten worse. Especially now that he's the only old guy in the race, it's more important than ever for the public to focus on Trump's lack of mental fitness when they make their decision this November.\"\n\nConway is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris. His banner photo on X is a hat declaring voters should \"vote for the prosecutor not the perpetrator,\" a reference to Harris' work as a prosecutor, including as California Attorney General. Those were the same words he used when endorsing Harris as President Joe Biden's successor after the President decided to drop out of the race and back Harris, a move Conway praised.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

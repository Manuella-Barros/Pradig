The victim, identified only as Jane Doe, testified during the nearly three-week week trial in Brooklyn Federal Court against the Nassau County-based USTA\u2019s chaperone Koralea Slagle and president Karen Cammer. The six teenage twirlers were supposed to visit foster homes and grade schools, and take part in a parade but instead, the victim said, they were left with their host, a man named Jacobo who headed the local Lions Club. Then 17 and originally from Ohio, Doe alleged Slagle turned a blind eye while the teens were kept out til 3 a.m. each night and offered booze, but no water, to drink. She had told her mother Jacobo was acting \u201ckinda creepy\u201d toward her, adding, \u201cthere have been multiple instances where he just wants to take me but I\u2019ve refused,\u201d according to the legal filing. One night the girl felt sick after being given a \u201cspecial mojito\u201d \u2014 hours later Jacobo used a key to enter her locked room, and sexually assaulted the ill and disoriented girl, she said in court papers. A criminal investigation was later launched in Peru but its status is unknown. The jury found Slagle, a Kansas resident, and the USTA negligent, awarding $3 million for past damages and $1.2 million for future pain and suffering, with Slagle personally responsible for $504,000 of the award. \u201cIf I stayed silent, the USTA would have never taken accountability for their actions,\u201d the victim, now 22, told The Post. \u201cI have reclaimed my voice by sharing the truth but continue to work towards healing. Athletes are not disposable, and their dignity and safety should never be sacrificed.\u201d Doe\u2019s lawyer, Andy Goldwasser, added, \u201cAfter four and half years our client finally received the vindication and rightful outcome she deserved. Maybe now, the USTA will stop prioritizing power over safety.\u201d \u201cWhile USTA is disappointed with the verdict and is evaluating next steps, we respect the process and acknowledge the outcome. It is a serious reminder of our imperative to protect and support every athlete in our organization,\u201d the organization said. \u201cUSTA remains fully committed to ensuring a safe and supportive sporting environment for all athletes.\u201d", "summary": "The victim testified during the 2.5 week trial against the Nassau County-based USTA, chaperone Koralea Slagle and association president Karen Cammer.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/champion-us-baton-twirler-wins-4-2-million-verdict-after-nightmare-trip/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/left-83300269.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ecv9Exyn-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:44:44", "author": "Kathianne Boniello", "authors": ["Kathianne Boniello"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.422}

{"id": 239779856, "title": "Obituary: Eugene \u2018Pooch\u2019 Davis,  League of Ireland great whose goalscoring talent won him widespread acclaim", "text": "From their years in D\u00fan Laoghaire CBS and playing for St Joseph\u2019s, Sallynoggin, from under-12s to youths, Devlin had no doubts: \u201cFrom the first day I met him, he was the nicest person I ever met. We were always friends.\u201d They were capped as youths, but the following year Devlin was overage and Davis was capped again, this time alongside Liam Brady. Davis\u2019s nickname was \u2018Pooch\u2019, a variation on \u201cpoach\u201d due to his ability to poach a goal out of next to nothing. \u201cThe ball would drop to him and, \u2018whoosh\u2019, next minute it was in the back of the net,\u201d Devlin said. His goals against Iceland helped Ireland qualify for the Uefa finals in Barcelona, where they played England, Yugoslavia and Belgium. \u201cAlthough we were beaten 4-0 by England, it was no disgrace as they won the tournament,\u201d Davis recalled. \u201cTheir team included Trevor Francis, Kevin Beattie, Brian Little and Phil Thompson, all of whom made it in the First Division afterwards.\u201d When Joey\u2019s won the Leinster under-17 Cup, Shamrock Rovers signed four of the team, including Devlin and Davis. Although Davis made his debut for the Hoops and scored his first League goals for them, his career didn\u2019t really take off until he moved, with winger Terry Daly, to Athlone Town for the 1974-5 season. Under manager Amby Fogarty, they finished runners-up and qualified for the Uefa Cup, the first time the club had qualified for Europe. We needed a point to win the League and I needed a goal to get the Soccer Reporter-sponsored prize of \u00a31,500 for 22 League goals. We won and I got two goals The Uefa Cup proved a great experience for Davis and Athlone. Drawn at home against Norway\u2019s Valerenga, the score was 1-1 with a quarter of an hour to go when Fogarty pushed Davis up front and he responded with two goals. The second was especially memorable: \u201cI got the ball on the break near the half-way line,\u201d Davis said, \u201cbeat the full-back and another defender and, as the goalkeeper came out, I went wide of him and steered the ball into the net.\u201d It sent the crowd wild. Athlone drew the away leg 1-1 to set the scene for two memorable games against AC Milan. Davis enjoyed his most fruitful seasons when partnering Frank Devlin, a player whose close control made him ideal to play off. With Michael O\u2019Connor on the wing, Athlone had a strong attack and duly claimed the club\u2019s first League title in 1980-81. Manager Turlough O\u2019Connor, conscious of Davis\u2019s propensity to be on the heavy side, had him on a special diet and extra training. The result: a club record 23 goals as well as the title. \u201cThe week we won the League in Limerick was probably the highlight of my career,\u201d he later recalled. \u201cWe needed a point to win the League and I needed a goal to get the Soccer Reporter-sponsored prize of \u00a31,500 for 22 League goals. We won and I got two goals.\u201d He had been with Athlone for eight years, but he looked for a move to a Dublin club in 1982 as his children were growing up. St Patrick\u2019s Athletic paid \u00a32,400 for him. He proved he still had goals in his boots at St Pat\u2019s and in later moves to Bohemians, UCD and Bray Wanderers. Career-wise, he started a butcher\u2019s apprenticeship with Hick\u2019s in D\u00fan Laoghaire, and later in life set up his own successful courier business. He was assistant manager to Pat Devlin in Athlone in the early 1990s, but when Devlin moved on to Drogheda, he opted out, due to his business interests and growing family. \u201cHe was a real Number 10, a great finisher, and great to have in the dressing-room,\u201d Devlin says. Davis is survived by daughter Gina, sons Trevor, Barry, Eugene and Gavin.", "summary": "<p>Eugene Davis, who has died aged 70 after a short illness, is remembered by sports fans as a legend of League of Ireland football.

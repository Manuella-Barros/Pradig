The deal consisted of an initial $1.25 billion equity stake in September, followed by a further $2.75 billion transaction finalized earlier this year.\n\nAs part of the deal Amazon will make Anthropic's powerful large language models available on its Bedrock platform for building generative AI applications. Anthropic's models will also be trained and deployed on Amazon's own custom AI chips, which were built by its Amazon Web Services cloud computing division.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, an Amazon spokesperson said the company is \"disappointed\" the CMA proceeded with an initial Phase 1 merger probe, adding that its collaboration with Anthropic \"does not raise any competition concerns or meet the CMA's own threshold for review.\"\n\n\"By investing in Anthropic, Amazon, along with other companies, is helping Anthropic expand choice and competition in this important technology.

Amazon Partnership With Anthropic", "body": "Amazon's partnership with artificial intelligence company Anthropic is being investigated by the United Kingdom's competition and markets regulator.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a merger inquiry after collecting comments in April and May on whether the partnership could result in a lessening of competition in the market, according to a Thursday (Aug. 8) update.\n\nThe CMA said in a commencement notice that it has sufficient information to begin an investigation to decide whether it should advance to a \"phase 2 investigation.\"\n\nThe regulator will announce that decision by Oct. 4, according to the notice.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said in a statement provided to PYMNTS that the company is \"disappointed\" that the CMA did not end its probe, adding that the company's collaboration with Anthropic does not raise competition concerns and that Anthropic is working to become a viable alternative in a generative AI market that is currently dominated by one company.\n\n\"By investing in Anthropic, Amazon, along with other companies, is helping Anthropic expand choice and competition in this important technology,\" the statement said.\n\nAnthropic said in a statement provided to PYMNTS that Amazon does not have a seat on the company's board and that Anthropic will cooperate with the CMA to provide it with a \"comprehensive understanding\" of the investment and the collaboration.\n\n\"We are an independent company,\" the Anthropic statement said. \"Our strategic partnerships and investor relationships do not diminish our corporate governance independence or our freedom to partner with others.\"\n\nAmazon said in March that it made a total investment of $4 billion in Anthropic, with an initial investment of $1.25 billion in September 2023 followed by an additional $2.75 billion investment in March.\n\nThe CMA asked for input from stakeholders in April about whether this investment and other Big Tech partnerships with AI companies should be classified as mergers.\n\nJoel Bamford, executive director of mergers at CMA, said in an April press release that \"fair and effective competition in Foundation Model markets is critical to making sure the full benefits of this transformation are realized by people and businesses in the U.K., as well as our wider economy where technology has a huge role to play in growth and productivity.\"", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Starting the investigation comes soon after the CMA's solicitation for comments on Google's connections to the same company, a relationship marked by Google's $300 million initial investment, followed by another $2 billion.\n\nAnthropic, founded in 2021 and headquartered in San Francisco, focuses on large language models and offers a conversational AI called Claude. The firm has raised $10 billion in total funding, making it a notable rival to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini platforms.\n\nThe influx of investments in AI from major tech entities is under increasing regulatory inspection. These companies frequently opt for heavy investments or hiring from startups to avoid direct acquisitions. The CMA's probe of Amazon's financial involvement in Anthropic embodies this wider scrutiny.\n\nEarlier this year in April, the CMA revealed preliminary inquiries into multiple Big Tech deals, including Microsoft's investment in Mistral AI, a French startup.

If it's officially considered a merger, the investigation will then look into whether or not it will harm competition in the country. The investigators have 40 working days to come to a decision.\n\nAmazon has previously stated the investment does not give it a majority stake in Anthropic, . The company that the investment \"does not raise any competition concerns or meet the CMA's own threshold for review.\" Anthropic has also dismissed the notion that the investment indicates a merger of any kind.\n\n\"We are an independent company,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"Amazon does not have a seat on Anthropic's board, nor does it have any board observer rights.

This would, in theory, give the older company all of the benefits of a merger but without the regulatory scrutiny that would accompany an official acquisition.\n\nTo that end, the CMA is also preparing to launch an investigation into Google and its own massive investments into Anthropic.

Anthropic has raised $10 billion since its inception back in 2021, so Google and Amazon account for over half of that amount.\n\nThe regulatory agency is into Microsoft's close partnership with OpenAI, which could represent a quasi-merger.

This began with an initial investment of $1.25bn that gave the e-commerce giant a minority stake in the business.\n\nAmazon followed this up in February with a $2.75bn investment, further boosting its minority ownership position. Other tech giants have gained a foothold into Anthropic, such as Google and Salesforce.\n\nThe CMA announced its concerns earlier this year and invited interested parties to comment on Amazon's investments into Anthropic. The authority said it had concerns that the partnership may have resulted in a \"relevant merger situation\" and that that development could impact competition in UK markets.\n\nThe UK watchdog confirmed today (8 August) that it has \"sufficient information\" to launch a phase one investigation into this partnership. If sufficient evidence is found that the CMA's concerns are valid, it can later launch a more in-depth phase two investigation.\n\nThe investigation will commence from tomorrow onwards and the CMA said it will announce its decision on conducting a deeper investigation by 4 October 2024.\n\nAs part of the deal between Anthropic and Amazon, the AI start-up said it will use AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips to build, train and deploy its future foundation models. The two will also work together on improving the chips in the future.\n\nAmazon developers and engineers will also be able to build with Anthropic models via Amazon Bedrock so they can \"incorporate generative AI capabilities into their work\".\n\nThe moves Amazon took to partner up with Anthropic are similar to the investments Microsoft made into OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. Microsoft reportedly invested billions of dollars to gain a minority stake in the business. The focus on AI helped propel the tech giant into becoming the most valuable company in the world.\n\nThe CMA appeared to be on the road to investigating the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI towards the end of 2023, but there have been no developments since then. The CMA has instead focused on the tech giant's investments into other AI start-ups such as Inflection AI.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

It will decide whether to escalate the inquiry by October 4.\n\nAmazon said it was \"disappointed\" by the decision and that its work with Anthropic \"does not raise any competition concerns or meet the CMA's own threshold for review\".\n\n\"By investing in Anthropic, Amazon, along with other companies, is helping Anthropic expand choice and competition in this important technology,\" it said.\n\nThursday's move comes weeks after the CMA officially launched a formal merger inquiry into rival Microsoft's hiring of staff from start-up Inflection AI. The tech giant paid $650mn in March to hire a number of the start-up's staff, including its chief executive Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of Google's DeepMind, and to license its technology.\n\nRegulators worldwide have increasingly turned their attention to the alliances being forged between Big Tech and AI start-ups that are developing the technology that has captured global attention and which advocates promise will usher in a new era of computing.\n\nThe tie-ups have prompted concerns that the world's largest and most well-capitalised companies are set to wield an outsized influence over how the hugely expensive technology will develop and who the winners from its adoption will be.\n\nAmazon's $4bn Anthropic investment is among the prominent AI deals that the CMA said in April it was seeking views about as it took steps to probe what it called potentially anti-competitive behaviour.\n\nThe CMA said at the time that it was considering whether the partnership amounted to a merger and, if so, whether that posed competition risks. The watchdog must seek comments before launching a formal investigation.\n\nThe deadline for the watchdog to escalate its probe into Microsoft and Inflection to the next level is September 11.\n\nA number of regulators globally are probing Microsoft's $13bn partnership with the leading start-up OpenAI.

Google last year agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic.\n\nFor Amazon, the funding marked its largest investment in another company since the e-commerce giant was founded three decades ago. Big Tech firms have been splurging on AI startups for years to get their hands on what they see as promising AI features that they hope to cash in on further down the line. However, those investments are increasingly the focus of regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe U.K's Competition and Markets Authority said it was seeking to establish whether Amazon's ties with Anthropic should be considered a de facto merger that might stifle competition in the U.K. An initial decision is due by Oct. 4.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said the company's ties to Anthropic didn't raise any competition concerns or meet the CMA's own threshold for a review. Amazon doesn't hold a board seat or decision-making powers at the startup, meaning Anthropic is free to work with any other partner of its choosing, the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Building models is expensive, and companies like Anthropic need access to a substantial amount of capital to train these models,\" the Amazon spokesperson said. \"By investing in Anthropic, Amazon, along with other companies, is helping Anthropic expand choice and competition in this important technology.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Anthropic said the startup remained an independent company since Amazon doesn't have a seat on Anthropic's board or any board observer rights. \"Our strategic partnerships and investor relationships do not diminish our corporate governance independence or our freedom to partner with others,\" the Anthropic spokesperson said.\n\nThe U.K. probe comes weeks after British officials launched a separate inquiry into Microsoft's ties with and hiring of former employees from Inflection AI, underscoring growing pressure that tech giants face to justify their arrangements with AI startups.\n\nBritish antitrust officials are also looking into whether Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI should be considered a de facto merger. Closer scrutiny has already forced Microsoft to loosen the strings on some arrangements. Last month, the group relinquished its seat as an observer on OpenAI's board after Microsoft realized its position had unsettled some antitrust officials.\n\nIn the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry into generative AI partnerships earlier this year, ordering companies to provide information regarding recent investments into startups.\n\nNews Corp, owner of Dow Jones Newswires and the Journal, has a content-licensing partnership with OpenAI.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_arms_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence arms race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition and Markets Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Corp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News Corp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/08/08/600x338/im-976386_1723127188763_1723127219691.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801136", "eventUri": "eng-9801136", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-04", "textStart": 939, "textEnd": 945}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The inquiry follows closely on the heels of a similar probe by the CMA into Google's relationship with Anthropic, after it invested around $2.3 billion in the start-up.\n\nAnthropic, established in 2021, operates as a public benefit corporation (PBC) and has secured $10 billion in funding since its inception.

In addition to the Amazon probe, the CMA is also anticipated to conduct a thorough investigation into Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI, following substantial investments made by Microsoft in recent years.\n\nIn April, the CMA disclosed that it was conducting preliminary inquiries into three similar deals involving Big Tech companies. One of these included Microsoft's investment in French startup Mistral AI, which was quickly deemed not to qualify for investigation under current merger regulations due to the size of the investment.

Amazon and Alphabet have both made significant investments in Anthropic, while Microsoft stands as the top investor in ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI has teamed up with Apple to incorporate ChatGPT into future iPhone models, as part of Apple's strategy to integrate more generative AI tools into its products.

The artificial intelligence (AI) startup has also received $4bn funding from Amazon.\n\nIn the US, the Federal Trade Commission has also begun looking at the multibillion-dollar investments that Microsoft made into OpenAI, as well as investments in Anthropic by Amazon and Google.\n\nIn April 2024, the CMA invited interested third parties to give their views on whether the partnership between Microsoft and Mistral AI, the partnership between Amazon and Anthropic, and Microsoft's hiring of former employees and related arrangements with Inflection AI, fall within UK merger rules and the impact these arrangements could have on competition in the UK.\n\nAlex Haffner, competitions partner at law firm Fladgate, described the CMA's latest move as \"the next of a series of cases being run by competition authorities globally into tie-ups between big tech and innovative AI scaleups based on concerns around control of the fast-moving and evolving AI sector\".\n\nThe CMA's AI foundation models: technical update, published in April 2024, reported that the growing presence across the foundation model value chain of a small number of incumbent technology firms, which already hold positions of market power in many of today's most important digital markets, could profoundly shape foundation model-related markets to the detriment of fair, open and effective competition. The report's authors warned that this could ultimately harm businesses and consumers, such as by reducing choice and quality, and raising prices, for example.\n\nThe technical update identified Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Nvidia as the major firms that have created \"an interconnected web\" of partnerships with several AI startups.\n\nIn general, funding from the major tech firms provides these startups with access to the cloud compute and graphics processing unit AI acceleration hardware and the immense datasets the tech giants have at their disposal for training and running AI inference applications. Along with the AI firms already mentioned, the startups identified in the report include Adept AI, AI21 Labs, Cohere, Contextual AI, Falcon LLM, Hugging Faces, InstaDeep, Midjourney, Perplexity AI, Recursion, Runway AI and Stability AI.\n\n\"In all, it appears that most of these partnerships did not involve an acquisition of a stake of 50% or more in the foundation model partner, though the detail of different partnership arrangements may vary,\" the CMA report stated.\n\nFladgate's Haffner added: \"The fact that the CMA is going to be looking in depth at this particular transaction will doubtless again bring up a debate, which is ongoing, as to how far competition regulators should go to intervene in the AI space at such a crucial time for its overall development.\"", "source":

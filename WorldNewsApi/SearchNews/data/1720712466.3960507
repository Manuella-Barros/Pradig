While they may not understand the gravity of the situation, you certainly will, and it can cause feelings like anger, frustration, and upset - especially when the child who hasn't included your little one is a classmate and neighbour. A mum was left feeling \"sad\" that her daughter had been \"left out of a party\", despite the fact that most other kids that her child is in class with were invited. \"I only found out as a mum from another class said yesterday 'see you tomorrow'. I asked what she meant and she said it's X's party,\" she penned. Taking to the popular forum Mumsnet, the mum asked whether she was being unreasonable to feel \"sad\" that her daughter had been left out of the party. She wrote: \"I wouldn't usually dwell on it but the venue happens to be right on our street! The birthday mum knows this as been to a party at our home last year. So have lots of other parents. \"I feel sad for my daughter as she might see people coming or going and will see the birthday decorations and realise it's her [friend's] birthday. I have no idea what time it is either but planning to take my daughter out for most of the day. \"I personally would never do this. In the past when we had parties at home I make sure we send cake for little neighbours and even invite them along if appropriate.\" In the comments, people understood why the mum was feeling bad for her daughter, with one writing: \"This is awful, yes I know they can invite who they want etc etc but a classmate and neighbour really is unkind.\" Other comments included: \"It's c**p been through it with my daughter quite a few times. Some people are horrible\", \"That's a shame for her. Take her out and do something fun instead so you avoid the comings and goings of the guests and any party noise\", and \"Are you sure the invitation didn't get lost?\" Someone said that it's just a sad reality of life, though, sharing: \"Unfortunately this will happen. I don't think it's horrible, no more horrible to force a child to invite someone to their birthday they don't want there. It is upsetting for you and your daughter, I think anyone would be upset. I would take your daughter out for a fun day instead.\" Another said the mum was giving it too much thought, penning: \"You are putting too much thought into this. It's a 6-year-old's party. It's probably a case of you can have this many people, who do you want? Nothing more. You won't give a s**t in a week or two. \"I hand on heart can't remember half the primary school kids' names now with an 18 and 16-year-old, let alone what parties they went to and didn't get invited to. The kids certainly don't remember. It doesn't mean the mum hates you or your kid, or that you've done something wrong. Forget about it.\" Do you have a story to share?

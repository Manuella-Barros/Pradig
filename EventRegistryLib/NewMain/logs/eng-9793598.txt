man accused of punching Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in the shoulder in June began on Tuesday, with Ms Frederiksen not expected to appear in court.\n\nShe suffered a minor whiplash injury when a man assaulted her in central Copenhagen on June 7 and cancelled her schedule for the next few days.\n\nThe Ekstra Bladet newspaper said the unidentified 39-year-old Polish man is charged with punching Ms Frederiksen's right shoulder with a clenched fist, causing her to lose her balance, but not fall.\n\nDefence lawyer Henrik Karl Nielsen told Copenhagen District Court that his client pleaded not guilty, it said.\n\nThe Polish man, who has been living in Denmark for five years, told the court that he was \"intoxicated by alcohol but not drunk\" and was just wandering around when he saw Frederiksen, Danish public broadcaster DR reported.\n\nFrederiksen was taking a break from campaigning for her Social Democratic Party in European Parliament elections when the assault occurred at a busy downtown Copenhagen plaza.\n\nThe attack was not linked to the campaign event.\n\nThe man, who has been held in pre-trial custody since the assault, also faces other charges including sexual harassment by exposing himself to passing people and groping a woman at a commuter train station, and fraud involving deposit-marked bottles and cans at two supermarkets.\n\nHe has confessed to those charges.\n\nMs Frederiksen, 46, is the leader of the Social Democratic Party and has been Denmark's prime minister since 2019.\n\nShe led the country through the global COVID-19 pandemic and a controversial 2020 decision to wipe out Denmark's entire captive mink population to minimise the risk of the mammals spreading the virus.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to end on Wednesday.\n\nIt was not

newspaper said the unidentified 39-year-old Polish man is charged with punching Ms Frederiksen's right shoulder with a clenched fist, causing her to lose her balance, but not fall.\n\nDefence lawyer Henrik Karl Nielsen told Copenhagen District Court that his client pleaded not guilty, it said.\n\nThe Polish man, who has been living in Denmark for five years, told the court that he was \"intoxicated by alcohol but not drunk\" and was just wandering around when he saw Frederiksen, Danish public broadcaster DR reported.\n\nFrederiksen was taking a break from campaigning for her Social Democratic Party in European Parliament elections when the assault occurred at a busy downtown Copenhagen plaza.\n\nDenmark\u00b4s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen attends a ceremony at the Danish

faces other charges including sexual harassment by exposing himself to passing people and groping a woman at a commuter train station, and fraud involving deposit-marked bottles and cans at two supermarkets.\n\nHe has confessed to those charges.\n\nMs Frederiksen, 46, is the leader of the Social Democratic Party and has been Denmark's prime minister since 2019.\n\nShe led the country through the global COVID-19 pandemic and a controversial 2020 decision to wipe out Denmark's entire captive mink population to minimise the risk of the mammals spreading the virus.\n\nThe trial is scheduled

(AP Photo/Jeremias Gonzalez, File)\n\n\"In the situation, it seemed he was angry,\" the bodyguard, identified only by his police number KF081, told the court, according to DR.\n\nThe Polish man was immediately arrested.\n\nFrederiksen was taking a break from campaigning for her Social Democratic Party in European Parliament elections when the assault occurred at a busy downtown Copenhagen plaza. The attack was not linked to the campaign event.\n\nThe man, who has been held in pretrial custody since the assault, also faces other charges including sexual harassment by exposing himself to passing people and groping a woman at a commuter train station, and fraud involving deposit-marked bottles and cans at two supermarkets. He has confessed to those charges.\n\nFrederiksen, 46, is the leader of the Social Democratic Party and has been Denmark\u00b4s prime minister since 2019. She led the country through the global COVID-19 pandemic and a controversial 2020 decision to wipe out Denmark\u00b4s entire captive mink population to minimize the risk of the mammals spreading the virus.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to end Wednesday. It was not immediately clean when the verdict will be announced.\n\nThe assault came as violence against politicians spread in the runup to the EU elections. In May, a candidate from Germany\u00b4s center-left Social Democrats was beaten and seriously injured while campaigning.\n\nIn Slovakia, the campaign was overshadowed by an attempt to assassinate populist Prime Minister Robert Fico on May 15, sending shockwaves through the nation and reverberating throughout Europe. Fico was shot in the abdomen and seriously wounded. The suspect was immediately arrested and faces terror charges.\n\nAssaults on politicians in Denmark are rare.\n\nOn March 23, 2003, two activists threw red paint at then-Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen inside parliament and were immediately arrested.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As he passes her, he gives her a hard punch with his fist on her shoulder,\" the bodyguard told the court.\n\nAfter the incident, Frederiksen said she was \"saddened and shaken\" and did not take part in the final day of campaigning for the EU parliament elections in June.\n\nSpeaking a week after the attack, Frederiksen said she had sought professional help.\n\n\"I have gotten help for the first time in my life,\" she told Danish television TV2 at a political festival on Denmark's Bornholm island.\n\nFrederiksen became Denmark's youngest-ever head of government when she was elected in 2019, aged 41. She won re-election in 2022.\n\n- Widely condemned -\n\nNeither the prosecution nor defence will call Frederiksen as a witness during the trial.\n\n\"It's the prosecution authority's assessment that it is not necessary to call her as a witness,\" special prosecutor Anders Larsson explained.\n\n\"This is an expression of our belief that we can bring the case to a conviction without her giving a statement,\" the prosecutor added.\n\nThe attack was widely condemned by leading European politicians, including EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who called it a \"despicable act which goes against everything we believe and fight for in Europe\".\n\nIt followed a spate of assaults on European politicians from across the political spectrum ahead of the European Parliament elections in June.\n\nOn May 15, Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico was shot four times at close range as he greeted supporters after a government meeting.\n\nSeveral politicians in Germany had been attacked at

The attack was not linked to the campaign event.\n\nThe man, who has been held in pretrial custody since the assault, also faces other charges including sexual harassment by exposing himself to passing people and groping a woman at a commuter train station, and fraud involving deposit-marked bottles and cans at two supermarkets. He has confessed to those charges.\n\nFrederiksen, 46, is the leader of the Social Democratic Party and has been Denmark's prime minister since 2019. She led the country through the global COVID-19 pandemic and a controversial 2020 decision to wipe out Denmark's entire captive mink population to minimise the risk of the mammals spreading the virus.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to end on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear when the verdict would be announced.\n\nThe assault came as violence against politicians spread in the run-up to the EU elections. In May, a candidate from Germany's centre-left Social Democrats was beaten and seriously injured while campaigning.\n\nIn Slovakia, the campaign was overshadowed by an attempt to assassinate populist Prime Minister Robert Fico on 15 May, sending shockwaves through the nation and reverberating throughout Europe. Fico was shot in the abdomen and seriously wounded. The suspect was immediately arrested and faces terror charges.\n\nAssaults on politicians in Denmark are rare: on 23 March 2003, two activists threw red paint at then-Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen inside parliament and were immediately arrested.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

June.\n\nSpeaking a week after the attack, Frederiksen said she had sought professional help.\n\n\"I have gotten help for the first time in my life,\" she told Danish television TV2 at a political festival on Denmark's Bornholm island.\n\nNeither the prosecution nor defence will call Frederiksen as a witness during the trial.\n\n\"It's the prosecution authority's assessment that it is not necessary to call her as a witness,\" Larsson explained.\n\n\"This is an expression of our belief that we can bring the case to a conviction without her giving a statement,\" the prosecutor added.\n\nThe attack was widely condemned by leading European politicians, including EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who called it a \"despicable act which goes against everything we believe and fight for in Europe\".\n\nIt followed a spate of assaults on European politicians from across the political spectrum ahead of the European Parliament elections in June.\n\nOn May 15, Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico was shot four times at close range as he greeted supporters after a government meeting.\n\nSeveral politicians in Germany had been attacked at work or on the campaign trail.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Agence

Frederiksen is not expected to testify at the trial.\n\nEyewitnesses have told Reuters that Frederiksen was able to leave the scene unaided after the assault. Her office said at the time that she had sustained a minor whiplash injury.\n\nThe defendant, dressed in a T-shirt with a colourful print, said he had lived in Denmark since 2019. He also admitted in court to some charges of fraud and indecent exposure, while denying others.\n\nA verdict in the case could come as soon as Wednesday, the Copenhagen court has said.\n\nAfter the June attack, Frederiksen spoke in a television interview of what she said was a change in public discourse, citing increased hostility on social media and aggressive behaviour.\n\nThe attack happened three weeks after Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico was seriously injured in an assassination attempt and just over a month before the shooting of U.S. presidential contender Donald Trump.

He has also been charged with several counts of indecent exposure and fraud relating to other incidents.\n\nAfter the accused, the court heard testimonies from two of Frederiksen's bodyguards and a friend she was on her way to meet for coffee. One of the bodyguards said there were many people walking in the street when the man approached the prime minister.\n\n\"He says something incomprehensible to her. As he passes her, he gives her a hard punch with his fist on her shoulder,\" the bodyguard told the court.\n\nFollowing the testimonies about the attack, the court spent the remainder of the day's proceedings dealing with the other charges.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Anders Larsson also noted at the end of the day that the accused had previously received a number of fines for theft and vandalism.\n\nAfter the incident, Frederiksen said she was \"saddened and shaken\" and did not take part in the final day of campaigning for the EU parliament elections in June.\n\nSpeaking a week after the attack, Frederiksen said she had sought professional help.\n\n\"I have gotten help for the first time in my life,\" she told Danish television TV2 at a political festival on Denmark's Bornholm island.\n\nFrederiksen became Denmark's youngest-ever head of government when she was elected in 2019, aged 41. She won re-election in 2022.\n\nNeither the prosecution nor defence called Frederiksen as a witness during the trial.\n\n\"It's the prosecution authority's assessment that it is not necessary to call her as a witness,\" Larsson explained.\n\n\"This is an expression of our belief that we can bring the case to a conviction without her giving a statement,\" the prosecutor added.\n\nAsked by AFP after the day's proceedings whether a political motive had been ruled out, Larsson said he didn't want to go into the accused's explanation.\n\nThe accused's lawyer Henrik Karl Nielsen meanwhile said: \"We haven't heard anything (in court) today about any political motives.\"\n\n\"He has seen a person whom he knows, a well-known person, and something has happened,\" Nielsen told AFP.\n\nThe attack was widely condemned by leading European politicians, including EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who called it a \"despicable act which goes against everything we believe and fight for in Europe\".", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette_Frederiksen", "type": "person",

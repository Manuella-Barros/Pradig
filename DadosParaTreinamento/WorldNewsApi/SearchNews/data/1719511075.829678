The judgment was on a suit by filed in 2021, against Ifeanyi Israel and UI Properties Ltd, bythe Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) following a petition by one Dr. J. K. Okoye. According to the charge, Israel had failed to remit the said sum collected as rent from properties he was managing on behalf of the nominal complainant, who was the first prosecution witness in the trial. The defendants had failed to remit rents from properties located in Wuse Zone 6, Utako, Maitama, and Garki in Abuja and Lekki Phase in Lagos. Justice Enobie Obanor of High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, in a judgment delivered recently found Ifeanyi Israel and UI Properties Ltd guilty of a one-count charge of criminal breach of trust in the management of the properties. The judge, however, granted the defendants the option of a N100,000 fine each and to refund the N132.5 million rent. \u201cThus, where all the essential ingredients of the offences charged, have been proved or established by the Prosecution, and there is no valid defence or rebuttal from the defence, the charge is proved beyond reasonable doubt. And I so hold,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThe sole issue is resolved in favour of the Prosecution against the Defendants. \u201cThe Defendants are therefore found guilty of the one count charge of criminal breach of trust contrary to Section 311 of the Penal Code Act, Laws of the Federation (Abuja), 1990 and punishable under Section 312 of the same law\u201d Justice Obanor held. Following his conviction, Israel\u2019s lawyer, C Emeka-Izima urged the court to be lenient on the defendant on the grounds that he is the first son of his parents and shoulders the responsibility of taking care of his mother and assisting his younger siblings. The defendant\u2019s counsel equally pleaded with the court for leniency on the ground that he is the sole breadwinner of his family as his wife is unemployed and has no means of livelihood to cater to the needs of their children. \u201cHaving found the defendants guilty and after a thorough consideration of the severity and nature of the offence committed by the defendants, punishable under Section 312 of the Penal Code Act, Laws of Federation 1990, and having heard the plea of allocutus, consequently, the 1st defendant is hereby sentenced to four (4) years imprisonment for the single count or in the alternative an option of paying a fine of N 100,000 (One Hundred Thousand Naira) only. \u201cThe 2nd defendant, (an artificial person) is sentenced to pay a fine of N100,000 (One Hundred Thousand Naira) only. Recall that in his defence, Israel had pleaded that he used part of the money for renovation work, which the court found was without the consent of the owner.

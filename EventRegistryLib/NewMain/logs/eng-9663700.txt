With the league leaders facing a tough test against third-placed LA Galaxy, who are also on 34 points, the Earthquakes will be hoping to snatch top spot with a victory on Sunday.\n\nHowever, recent meetings with their opponents suggest this might not be a straightforward game for the hosts. They have only won once in their last five meetings against San Jose, losing three times, though these defeats came away from home.\n\nBoasting an unblemished home record so far this season with seven wins and two draws, Los Angeles will be looking to win a seventh consecutive game on home soil across all competitions.\n\nMeanwhile, it has been a challenging season for the Earthquakes, who currently languish at the bottom of the Western Conference with 11 points after 18 matches.\n\nDefending has been their Achilles' heel, as they have conceded the most goals in the conference (45), five more than Sporting Kansas City. Luchi Gonzalez must find a way to shore up his defence if they are to end their current seven-game winless run across all competitions, with six of those defeats coming in MLS.\n\nThe Earthquakes lost 2-1 against Portland Timbers in their last league outing, making it three successive defeats while conceding 11 goals and scoring just four.\n\nWith their last victory coming away at Colorado Rapids in May, the visitors will be hoping to pull off another away-day miracle when they take to the pitch on Sunday.\n\nLos Angeles FC Major League Soccer form:\n\nWWWWWD\n\nSan Jose Earthquakes Major League Soccer form:\n\nLLDLLL\n\nTeam News\n\nLos Angeles FC lost just one player to international duty as young attacker Cristian Olivera is with Uruguay at the upcoming Copa America.\n\nHowever, they also have one player absent due to injury, as Lorenzo Dellavalle has hurt his knee and is unavailable for the game.\n\nTwo players have questionable fitness heading into this match - David Martinez with a back issue and Maxime Chanot who is looking to quickly recover from a leg injury.\n\nThe Quakes will be without midfielder Carlos Gruezo, who is away with Ecuador on international duty at the Copa America.\n\nThere are also injury concerns with Daniel Britto (lower body), JT Marcinkowski (knee), Jamar Ricketts (lower body) and Bruno Wilson (lower body), while Carlos Akapo is questionable.\n\nLos Angeles FC possible starting lineup:\n\nLloris; Palencia, Segura, Long, Campos; Duenas, Atuesta, Tillman; Ordaz, Bogusz, Bouanga\n\nSan Jose Earthquakes possible starting lineup:\n\nJackson; Akapo, Munie, Beason, Costa; Tsakiris, Yueill, Pellegrino, Espinoza; Lopez, Ebobisse\n\nWe say: Los Angeles FC 2-0 San Jose Earthquakes\n\nLos Angeles are the most in-form side in the MLS right now and have been almost invincible on home soil. With San Jose's struggles this year, we see nothing but victory for the hosts in this affair.\n\nFor data analysis of the most likely results, scorelines and more for this match please click

Portland Timbers vs. Vancouver Whitecaps", "body": "Sports Mole previews Sunday's Major League Soccer clash between Portland Timbers and Vancouver Whitecaps, including predictions, team news and possible lineups.\n\nAnother chapter in the Cascadia Cup rivalry takes centre stage at Providence Park this weekend when the Portland Timbers host the Vancouver Whitecaps in MLS action on Saturday.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Timbers moved up to seventh in the Western Conference with a 2-1 victory over the San Jose Earthquakes, putting them a point behind the Caps for sixth, with the latter suffering a 3-2 defeat versus the New England Revolution last weekend.\n\nMatch preview\n\nAnother strong second half extended the Timbers MLS unbeaten run to five matches, their longest stretch without a defeat all season.\n\nTheir recent form has put them back into a playoff position, though they are only two points above that post-season line in the Western Conference.\n\nPhil Neville's men have lived and died by their aggressive, up-tempo style throughout the campaign, scoring the third-most goals in the Western Conference (34) and conceding the third-most (33).\n\nAfter going winless in four of their first five MLS encounters at Providence Park this year, the Timbers are on a three-match domestic unbeaten run on home soil.\n\nSo far in 2024, they have dropped 12 points domestically when scoring the opening goal but have also claimed eight points after conceding the opener.\n\nPortland have lost their last two meetings with Vancouver by a 3-2 score, and another loss this weekend would mark the first time they will have suffered three consecutive defeats against them at Providence Park in MLS play.\n\nA poor first half in New England was ultimately too much for the Whitecaps to overcome last Saturday, as their two-match MLS winning run ended.\n\nVanni Sartini's men have been competitive all year but are still struggling to find the consistency of the elite MLS teams, with their longest domestic winning and losing run this season being two games.\n\nThroughout the 2024 league season, the Whitecaps have not fared well when coming from behind, claiming just one point in MLS when trailing at the interval (1-1 draw versus the Seattle Sounders).\n\nAt the midway point of their league campaign, the Caps are fifth in the Western Conference, four points behind Minnesota United for a top-four place.\n\nA win on Saturday would give them five away from home over this domestic campaign, surpassing their total from last season (four), and giving them 17 points on the road, one fewer than they managed to earn during the 2023 regular season.\n\nThey have not lost to a Cascadia rival all season, beating the Timbers at home earlier this year (3-2) while also earning a win (2-0) and a draw (1-1) against the Seattle Sounders.\n\nPortland Timbers Major League Soccer form:\n\nLWWDDW\n\nVancouver Whitecaps Major League Soccer form:\n\nLDLWWL\n\nVancouver Whitecaps form (all competitions):\n\nDLLWWL\n\nTeam News\n\nMarvin Loria missed another Portland encounter in midweek as the Costa Rican midfielder continues to recover from his knee surgery.\n\nThe Timbers will be without Maxime Crepeau and Kamal Miller, who are with the Canadian national team at the Copa America, and they will be facing their club teammate Miguel Araujo, who is representing Peru.\n\nJonathan Rodriguez and Evander scored their goals earlier this week, the seventh and eighth, respectively, for both players, helping the Timbers to a narrow victory on matchday 19.\n\nSam Adekugbe is close to returning from a calf injury, which has kept him out of the Whitecaps lineup for most of the campaign.\n\nVancouver will be without Ali Ahmed, who was called up to the Canadian national team for the Copa America, while Andres Cubas will represent Paraguay during that competition.\n\nA brace from Ryan Gauld kept the Caps' match with New England close as the Scottish attacker leads the team with nine goals in MLS this season.\n\nPortland Timbers possible starting lineup:\n\nPantemis; Mosquera, McGraw, Zuparic, Bravo; Williamson, Evander; Antony, Moreno, Paredes; Rodriguez\n\nVancouver Whitecaps possible starting lineup:\n\nTakaoka; Blackmon, Veselinovic, Utvik; Brown, Vite, Berhalter, Martins; Gauld; White, Kreilach\n\nWe say: Portland Timbers 2-1 Vancouver Whitecaps\n\nThe Caps have not proven they can consistently win in MLS, and without a key ball winner in Cubas, they will have a tough time contending with an aggressive Timbers side that possesses plenty of attacking depth.\n\nFor data analysis of the most likely results, scorelines and more for this match please click here.\n\nbody check tags ::\n\nPreviews by email\n\nClick here to get Sports

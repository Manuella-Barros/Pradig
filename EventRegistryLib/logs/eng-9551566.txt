Details have yet to emerge about how the 31-year-old native of Greece sustained the injury, but he was healthy when the Bucks were eliminated from the playoffs by the Indiana Pacers last week.\n\nAntetokounmpo hasn't made much of an impact on the court during his five seasons with the Bucks, but has certainly made his presence felt on the sidelines through his constant cheering and gesticulations. In 34 games this season, Antetokounmpo scored 32 total points while going 16 for 30 from the field. For his career, which also includes two games with the New York Knicks during the 2015-16 season, Antetokounmpo holds averages of 2.4 points, 1.6 rebounds and 0.6 assists.\n\nMostly entering the game during blowout wins or losses, Antetokounmpo elicits massive cheers from his teammates and the home Milwaukee crowd alike whenever his constant energy converts into something positive.\n\nGiannis honored his brother during this year's All-Star Game, writing \"Thanasis thanks for sharing\" on his sneakers. It hearkened back to a story of how Thanasis would lend Giannis his shoes growing up because the family couldn't afford multiple pairs.\n\nThe injury leaves Thanasis' future with the Bucks in jeopardy as he enters free agency this summer. Achilles tears typically require roughly a calendar year to get back on the court, which means Antetokounmpo could realistically miss the entire 2024-25 season. Whether a member of the Bucks next season or not, however, Thanasis will certainly continue to have a close relationship with his younger brother.\n\n\"Obviously, I trust Thanasis to death,\" Giannis said in October. \"Me and Thanasis, we haven't separated ourselves since I was born. We were always there. He always looks out for me and has my back in so many ways. I have his back in so many ways. It's a judgment that I trust blindly.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_ward_henninger@cbssports.com", "name": "Colin Ward-Henninger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanasis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thanasis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon_rupture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon rupture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowout_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blowout (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/08/08573509-33fe-4c4f-858c-344847d8b598/thumbnail/1200x675/9f72d809ea40b9b0ed8624af3d29026b/050824-giannisthanasis.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551566", "eventUri": "eng-9551566", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 234, "relevance": 1}

Milwaukee did not have Giannis Antetokounmpo or Damian Lillard due to nagging lower leg injuries. To make matters worse, Giannis' brother Thanasis Antetokounmpo has been hit with a shocking Achilles injury after the Bucks' postseason run.\n\nForward Thanasis Antetokounmpo has sustained a torn Achilles tendon and will undergo surgery, Shams Charania reports. Antetokounmpo did not see much time on the floor during the Pacers series or the regular season, yet, his injury is devastating. Hopefully, he will have a speedy and efficient recovery process.\n\nThanasis Antetokounmpo appeared in 34 regular season games for the Bucks and only played 4.6 minutes per contest. Antetokounmpo's on-the-court production is not eye-popping, but he offers great support to his younger brother Giannis and the rest of the Bucks squad.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo had big plans for the Bucks in the 2024 NBA Playoffs, but a late regular season calf strain prevented him from playing. Antetokounmpo was playing some of the best basketball of his career in 2023-24. The 29-year-old averaged 30.4 points, 11.5 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.1 blocks.\n\nUnfortunately, the NBA world did not get to see what the star forward could do in the postseason with Damian Lillard. The Portland Trail Blazers traded Lillard to Milwaukee shortly before the start of the regular season. As a result, the Bucks' championship odds increased. However, things did not come to fruition in 2024.\n\nLillard suffered an Achilles injury that caused him to miss some of the Pacers series. Before that, he achieved stout regular-season production. Lillard averaged 24.4 points, 7.0 assists, and 4.4 rebounds per game.\n\nIronically, Lillard and the Antetokounmpo brothers all suffered serious lower leg ailments.

Dame worked out a little bit, not knowing he was going to have Giannis.

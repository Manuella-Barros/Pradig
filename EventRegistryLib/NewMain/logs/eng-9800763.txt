democracy Uzra Zeya condemns police brutality on protesters", "body": "US Department of State Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights Uzra Zeya speaks during her visit to Kenya, August 7, 2024.\n\nImage: HANDOUT\n\nThe US Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights Uzra Zeya concluded her visit to Kenya with a condemnation on police in their actions against anti-government protesters.\n\nZeya demanded restraint from police when dealing with peaceful protesters as country expects fresh round of demonstrations on Thursday.\n\nShe also insisted free and independent media are indispensable to thriving democracies.\n\nZeya said she had engaged top government officials over the security agencies' conduct to register her concerns.\n\n\"In my discussions with President Ruto and senior Kenyan officials, I condemned violence committed against peaceful protestors, human rights defenders and journalists and urged protection of the fundamental freedoms of peaceful assembly and expression as enshrined in Kenya's constitution.\"\n\nZeya spoke at the US Embassy in Nairobi at the conclusion of her trip to Kenya.\n\n\"I also underscored the critical importance of security forces exercising restraint, rejecting violence in all its forms, and prompt investigations of and accountability for disappearances, excessive use of force, and other human rights abuses,\" she said.\n\nZeya said it was her first visit to Kenya and a time when the country is experiencing youth-led protests over among other issues, graft.\n\nShe called for accountability in the incidents and those responsible to be prosecuted.\n\nDuring her trip in the country, Zeya met Ruto, National Security Advisor Dr Monica Juma, Chief Justice Martha Koome and senior officials from the Interior Ministry, law enforcement and anti-corruption sectors.\n\nThe institutions include Independent Policing Oversight Authority, DCI and EACC.\n\nZeya said she also heard from and engaged Kenya's vibrant civil society, including young changemakers and democratic reformers, working to advance a better future for all Kenyans.\n\n\"As President Biden declared in welcoming President Ruto to Washington for his historic state visit, our two nations have shared responsibility to meet together as partners - for security, for prosperity, for innovation, and most importantly, for democracy.\n\n\"That common cause and impetus is what brought me to Kenya, with three overarching goals: first, to strengthen our partnership in support of democratic reform and rights-respecting civilian security; second, to deepen our collaboration on shared regional and global challenges and third, to expand our humanitarian cooperation to supportmarginalized and vulnerable populations,\" she said.\n\nShe said her visit comes at a challenging moment for Kenyan democracy after the government response to youth-led protests took many innocent lives.\n\nHuman rights organisations say over 60 people have been killed in the protests and more than 400 injured while more than 60 people are missing.\n\nMore protests dubbed Nane Nane have been called for August 8.\n\n\"I extend my deepest condolences for allloss of life and sympathies to those injured.\"\n\nZeya said she welcomed government steps to address the root causes of protesters'concerns, strengthen public trust and take further action to embrace dialogue and national reconciliation.\n\n\"Democracy requires constant work and as we acknowledge the progress that Kenya has made, we must also recognise the work that remains to be done in terms of police accountability and human-centeredsecurity.\n\n\"To this end, I encouraged President Ruto to take concrete action on his recent public pledges to strengthen rule of law, champion anti-corruption initiatives and advance accountability within his own government,\" she said.\n\nOn all of these complex issue sets, Zeya added, Kenyan civil society has vital contributions to make.\n\nShe said the United States is deeply appreciative of Kenya's active leadership in addressing conflict across the African continent and around the world including Northern Ethiopia, Eastern DRC and South Sudan to recent efforts combating al Shabaab extremists in Somalia.\n\nShe also welcomed Kenya's leadership of the Multinational Security Support mission in Haiti.\n\n\"This vital effort, for which we are contributing $300 million in U.S. logistics, equipment and materiel support, will help bring much-needed relief to the Haitian people.\"\n\nZeya said she also emphasised with Kenyan counterparts their longstanding partnership in supporting refugees, asylum-seekers and other vulnerable populations in need.\n\n\"As the fifth largest refugee host on the African continent, Kenya plays an immense and generous role hostinghundreds of thousands of vulnerable people fleeing conflict and persecution.\n\n\"We welcome and recognise Kenya's efforts to promote the socioeconomic inclusion of refugees, including the innovative Shirika Plan to transition refugee camps into integrated settlements,\" she said.\n\nThe US provided more than $306 million in humanitarian assistance across Kenya, including nearly $55 million specifically for refugee response, she revealed.\n\n\"We also appreciate Kenya's partnership in helping us reach our target of resettling a record number of refugees from the African continent by the end of this fiscal year -- one more example of how deepercooperation benefits both our societies.\"\n\nThe Under Secretary said the US stands ready to deepen cooperation with the Kenyan people and government to help the countries' democracies meet the moment and deliver for their citizens, the region and the world.", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@the-star.co.ke", "name":

Rights condemns heavy-handed approach to protests", "body": "NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug 8 -- The United States has condemned the heavy handedness by Kenya's security agents in their response to the youth-led anti-government protests witnessed in different parts of the country in months.\n\nThe protests which broke out in June have so far left at least 60 dead and hundreds injured according to figures from the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR).\n\nThe United States Under-Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights, Uzra Zeya, who concluded his working trip to Kenya on Wednesday, urged Kenyan security forces to exercise restraint while dealing with protestors going forward and \"rejecting violence in all it's forms\".\n\nZeya told journalists that during her engagement with President William Ruto, she insisted on prompt investigations of and accountability for disappearances, excessive use of force, and other human rights abuses.\n\n\"In my discussions with President Ruto and senior Kenyan officials, I condemned violence committed against peaceful protestors, human rights defenders, and journalists, andurged protection of the fundamental freedoms of peaceful assembly andexpression, as enshrined in Kenya's constitution,\" Zeya said.\n\nZeya's visit to Kenya comes at a time when the some Kenyans have vowed to return back to the streets on Thursday to demand accountability from the government which they argue has continued to ignore their plights.\n\nWhile addressing concerns sorrounding the freedom of the press in the country particularly as the State continues to target media houses over their coverage of the protests and other issues of public interest, Zeya maintained that \"free and independent media are indispensable to thriving democracies\".\n\nFurther, the US Under- Secretary pointed out that \"while democracy requires constant work\" more needs to be done in terms of police accountability in the execution of their duties.\n\nShe welcomed the ongoing efforts by the government to address the root causes of protesters' concerns and strengthen public trust.\n\n\"To this end, I encouraged President Ruto to take concrete actionon his recent public pledges to strengthen rule of law, champion anti-corruption initiatives, and advance accountability within his owngovernment,\" Zeya added.\n\nCommenting on Kenya-US relations, Zeya stated that the partnership between the two countries \"is more important than ever\".\n\nShe expressed United States' readiness to deepen cooperation with Kenyans and government to help both countries better serve their citizens, the region, and the world.\n\nDuring her two-day stay in the country, the US Under-Secretary also held talks with National Security Advisor Monica Juma, Chief Justice Martha Koome, and senior officials from the Interior Ministry, law enforcement and anti-corruption sectors.\n\nShe also engaged with Kenya's civil society organizations.", "source": {"uri": "capitalfm.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capital FM Kenya"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bruhan_makong@capitalfm.co.ke", "name": "Bruhan Makong", "type": "author",

One specific area... is the importance of investigating reports of security force abuses, prosecuting those found to be responsible and ensuring that accountability is achieved.\"\n\nApart from the president, she met with the National Security Adviser Monica Juma, Chief Justice Martha Koome, and senior officials from the Interior Ministry, law enforcement, and anti-corruption sectors.\n\nAlthough she noted that she was on a follow-up trip following President Ruto's state visit to the US, the present situation falls squarely in her office to ensure the rights of Kenyans to assemble and protest as per Article 37 of the constitution are respected.\n\nIn an interesting turn of events, even after the government made its commitment, a bill by Mbeere South MP Geoffrey Ruku on public assembly and demonstration was introduced in the National Assembly for the first time.\n\nIt seeks to introduce stringent measures on how Kenyans can protest, including imposing a fine and imprisonment in the way picketing will be conducted. It will give the government sweeping powers to clamp on Kenyans expressing their democratic right.\n\nAlso, the 'big brother' concerns come when civil society reports indicate that over 50 Kenyans have lost their life in the protests, around 400 injured and others missing. The media has also not been spared.\n\n60 people are missing\n\nHuman rights organisations say more than 60 people are missing after being abducted by state agencies.\n\n\"US security systems, partnerships, and cooperation programmes are also subject to US law that requires that we are vigilant with respect to our partners upholding human rights and where there are allegations of gross violations of human rights we have to be attentive and call for accountability,\" she stressed.\n\nMs Zeya disclosed that she also heard from and engaged Kenya's civil society, including young changemakers and democratic reformers, working to advance a better future for all Kenyans.\n\n\"As President Biden declared in welcoming President Ruto to Washington for his historic State visit, our two nations have shared responsibility to meet 'together, as partners - for security, for prosperity, for innovation, and most importantly, for democracy'\".\n\nOn media, she also insisted free and independent media are indispensable to thriving democracies as it is the only mirror to show the world the happenings.\n\nOn the regional front, she said the US is deeply appreciative of Kenya's active leadership in addressing conflict across the African continent and around the world including Northern Ethiopia, eastern DRC, and South Sudan to recent efforts combating al-Shabaab extremists in Somalia, Kenya plays a leading role in advancing regional peace and security.\n\nShe also lauded Kenya's leadership of the Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) in Haiti.\n\n\"This vital effort, for which we are contributing $300 million in U.S. logistics, equipment, and materiel support, will help bring much-needed relief to the Haitian people.\"\n\nShe emphasized Kenya's longstanding partnership with the US in supporting refugees, asylum-seekers, and other vulnerable populations in need. \"As the fifth largest refugee host on the African continent, Kenya plays an immense and generous role in hosting hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people fleeing conflict and persecution.\"\n\n\"We welcome and recognize Kenya's efforts to promote the socioeconomic inclusion of refugees, including the innovative Shirika Plan to transition refugee camps into integrated settlements,\" she said.\n\nMs Zeya explained that the US has provided more than $306 million in humanitarian assistance across Kenya, including nearly $55 million specifically for refugee response.\n\n\"We also appreciate Kenya's partnership in helping us reach our target of resettling a record number of refugees from the African continent by the end of this fiscal year -- one more example of how deeper cooperation benefits both our societies,\" she said.\n\nShe added that the US stands ready to deepen cooperation with the Kenyan people and government to help the countries' democracies meet the moment and deliver for our citizens, the region, and the world.", "source": {"uri":

One specific area... is the importance of investigating reports of security force abuses, prosecuting those found to be responsible and ensuring that accountability is achieved.\"\n\nRead: Court blocks arrest of MPs Gakuya and Gathiru amid allegations of funding goons during protests\n\nApart from the president, she met with the National Security Adviser Monica Juma, Chief Justice Martha Koome, and senior officials from the Interior Ministry, law enforcement, and anti-corruption sectors.\n\nAlthough she noted that she was on a follow-up trip following President Ruto's state visit to the US, the present situation falls squarely in her office to ensure the rights of Kenyans to assemble and protest as per Article 37 of the constitution are respected.\n\nIn an interesting turn of events, even after the government made its commitment, a bill by Mbeere South MP Geoffrey Ruku on public assembly and demonstration was introduced in the National Assembly for the first time.\n\nIt seeks to introduce stringent measures on how Kenyans can protest, including imposing a fine and imprisonment in the way picketing will be conducted. It will give the government sweeping powers to clamp on Kenyans expressing their democratic right.\n\nAlso, the 'big brother' concerns come when civil society reports indicate that over 50 Kenyans have lost their life in the protests, around 400 injured and others missing. The media has also not been spared.\n\nHuman rights organisations say more than 60 people are missing after being abducted by state agencies.\n\n\"US security systems, partnerships, and cooperation programmes are also subject to US law that requires that we are vigilant with respect to our partners upholding human rights and where there are allegations of gross violations of human rights we have to be attentive and call for accountability,\" she stressed.\n\nMs Zeya disclosed that she also heard from and engaged Kenya's civil society, including young changemakers and democratic reformers, working to advance a better future for all Kenyans.\n\n\"As President Biden declared in welcoming President Ruto to Washington for his historic State visit, our two nations have shared responsibility to meet 'together, as partners - for security, for prosperity, for innovation, and most importantly, for democracy'\".\n\nOn media, she also insisted free and independent media are indispensable to thriving democracies as it is the only mirror to show the world the happenings.\n\nRead: Nane Nane: Follow the law, acting IG Masengeli tells police\n\nOn the regional front, she said the US is deeply appreciative of Kenya's active leadership in addressing conflict across the African continent and around the world including Northern Ethiopia, eastern DRC, and South Sudan to recent efforts combating al-Shabaab extremists in Somalia, Kenya plays a leading role in advancing regional peace and security.\n\nShe also lauded Kenya's leadership of the Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) in Haiti.\n\n\"This vital effort, for which we are contributing $300 million in U.S. logistics, equipment, and materiel support, will help bring much-needed relief to the Haitian people.\"\n\nShe emphasized Kenya's longstanding partnership with the US in supporting refugees, asylum-seekers, and other vulnerable populations in need. \"As the fifth largest refugee host on the African continent, Kenya plays an immense and generous role in hosting hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people fleeing conflict and persecution.\"\n\n\"We welcome and recognize Kenya's efforts to promote the socioeconomic inclusion of refugees, including the innovative Shirika Plan to transition refugee camps into integrated settlements,\" she said.\n\nMs Zeya explained that the US has provided more than $306 million in humanitarian assistance across Kenya, including nearly $55 million specifically for refugee response.\n\n\"We also appreciate Kenya's partnership in helping us reach our target of resettling a record number of refugees from the African continent by the end of this fiscal year -- one more example of how deeper cooperation benefits both our societies,\" she said.\n\nShe added that the US stands ready to deepen cooperation with the Kenyan people and government to help the countries' democracies meet the moment and deliver for our citizens, the region, and the world.",

said Zeya raised issues on police operations in the recent anti-government protests and in particular claims of abduction.\n\nShe is also said to have raised the issue of the use of excessive force on the protesters.\n\nHer visit also coincides with 26 years since the bombing of the US embassy in Nairobi in 1998.\n\nOfficials said America is concerned with the manner in which Kenyan authorities have handled the recent anti-government protests.\n\nMore than 60 people are alleged to have been killed in the protests and 60 others are missing, human rights organizations say.\n\nRuto said Kenya and the United States have long historical ties, which have expanded into \"our common democratic tradition, peace and security in Eastern Africa, the fight against terrorism and people-to-people relations\".\n\nZeya had met the Director Directorate of Criminal Investigations Mohamed Amin in his office and a delegation of the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission.\n\nZeya who was accompanied by the US Ambassador to Kenya Meg Whitman encouraged the DCI to continue sustaining the fight against corruption and to ensure the provision of services in strict observance of human rights and the rule of law for a safe and secure society.\n\nAmin registered his appreciation to the US government through its embassy for the support being given to DCI through various partnerships including support for investigations and prosecution of cases of Gender Based Violence (GBV).\n\nHe further reiterated that the DCI remains proactive and professional in executing its mandate of investigating crimes, protecting life and property, apprehension of offenders, and supporting prosecution processes.\n\nThis, he said, is done in strict adherence to constitutional standards and with respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights.\n\nZeya said she held a productive meeting with Amin on the need for independent investigations to support rights, respect policing, tackle corruption, and address gender-based violence.\n\nShe also met a delegation of EACC officials led by Deputy CEO Abdi Mohamud.\n\nThe high-level meeting discussed modalities for cooperation and collaboration between US enforcement agencies and the EACC in upscaling the fight against corruption and economic crimes.\n\nZeya said the US is keen on elevating the fight against corruption through international anti-corruption frameworks and partnerships.\n\nMohamud underscored the significance of the existing strong partnerships between the Commission and US law enforcement agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).\n\nMohamud noted that through such partnerships with US enforcement agencies, EACC has benefitted through specialized training on complex financial investigations and advanced tools and equipment for corruption investigations.\n\nThe US visit solidifies the Commission's commitment to strengthening partnerships with

The US official, who was in Kenya on a two-day visit met President Ruto on Tuesday. She also engaged Chief Justice Martha Koome, Ruto's national security advisor Monica Juma, senior Interior Ministry officials, civil society representatives and \"young change-makers and democratic reformers,\" among other stakeholders, describing the engagements as \"fruitful\".\n\nHer remarks came hours to the 'Nane Nane' protests planned for today. Sources said cases of abductions of youth and other Kenyans have caused increasing concern within President Biden's administration.\n\nZeya's visit comes amid increased pressure by Washington on Ruto's administration over police killings of peaceful protesters and abductions, among other human rights abuses.\n\nUS Secretary of State Anthony Blinken also recently urged the president to ensure accountability for crimes committed by overbearing law enforcement agents, who have attacked protesters, medical personnel and journalists during the demos.\n\nNearly 60 Kenyans have died, with more than 400 others injured. More than 1,000 have been arrested for over the protests, with the police often accused of provoking violent clashes.\n\nZeya's visit is seen as perhaps the most significant expression of Washington's concern over continued violations of human rights by Ruto's administration. The US Embassy has recently been faulted over their alleged silence as such violations take place.\n\nZeya said she had \"condemned violence against peaceful protesters, human rights defenders and journalists,\" during her meeting with Ruto.", "source": {"uri": "standardmedia.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "Standard Digital News - Kenya"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_otieno@standardmedia.co.ke", "name": "Brian Otieno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzra_Zeya", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uzra Zeya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeya,_Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zeya, Russia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Zeya, Russia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police brutality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ruto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Ruto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Koome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martha Koome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Juma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monica Juma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/articles/thumbnails/xseMmI0jQHorV7AIczBjVXubxjiqdL5DWl5uglH6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800763", "eventUri": "eng-9800763", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Therefore, the US is providing nearly $536 million in new humanitarian aid to support host communities and local efforts for refugees and conflict-affected populations across the continent, including about $97 million for humanitarian partners in Ethiopia, with $87 million specifically addressing refugee needs.", "source": {"uri": "see.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "see.news"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeya_(river)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zeya (river)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Deputy_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Deputy Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sub-Saharan Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addis Ababa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Addis Ababa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ivory Coast"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ivory Coast"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senegal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Senegal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mauritania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mauritania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guinea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Guinea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gambia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Gambia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Gambia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i2.wp.com/see.news/images/2024/08/-1723201010-0.jpg?resize=920%2C550&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800763", "eventUri": "eng-9800763", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

The Tribune Content Agency\n\nFor almost all of his 21 years growing up in his native Texas until Thursday, he was mostly alone in his choice of favorite NFL teams.\n\nHe was born, grew up and went to high school in the Dallas suburb of DeSoto. Pretty much everyone he knew rooted for the hometown Cowboys.\n\nSame thing when he played at the University of Texas, a few hours down the interstate in Austin.\n\nNot Murphy. He's always loved...the Seattle Seahawks?\n\n\"I know it sounds a little funny. I get the question a lot: 'How come you didn't like the Cowboys?'\" Murphy said. \"But in my household everybody disliked the Cowboys for some reason.\n\n\"But, being a Seahawks fan just growing up, first, I just fell in love with the Legion of Boom, the guys, just the way they played on defense. Guys like Kam Chancellor, Bobby Wagner, Michael Bennett, all those guys, Richard Sherman. And just seeing how those guys play on defense, the way they just set the tone and go out there and just the way they play, that's something I wanted to be a part of.\n\n\"And also, too, growing up, I was a huge fan of Russell Wilson. I loved Russell Wilson as a kid, watching those guys go out there and just dominate their opponent and win a Super Bowl. It was crazy.\"\n\nSo was Thursday. Murphy, the man-child defensive tackle who was 250 pounds by 10th grade in DeSoto, the second defensive player picked in the NFL draft last week, was holding his new, blue, Seahawks jersey with new number 91 on it inside the team's headquarters.\n\nMurphy's arm tattoo beneath his new Seahawks gear reads: \"Humble Beast.\"\n\nHe arrived with seven other new draft picks, about 15 undrafted and signed free agents plus a handful of tryout players for Seattle's three-day rookie minicamp this weekend.\n\n\"It's a dream come true,\" he said.\n\nMurphy even opposed his mother with his Seahawks fandom growing up. Seneca Murphy liked Peyton Manning and was rooting for the legendary quarterback and his Broncos in Super Bowl 48 a decade ago. Then-11-year-old Byron taunted Mom throughout the Seahawks' blowout of Denver in that Feb. 2014 title game.\n\nIt's still Seattle's only NFL championship.\n\n\"That's one of my goals. I'm trying to win games and bring a Super Bowl here, as well,\" Byron Murphy said.\n\nHis goals for his rookie season, in particular?\n\n\"First, I want to win. That's my main goal,\" he said. \"Secondly, hopefully I'll be able to win Defensive Rookie of the Year.\"\n\nByron Murphy 'blessed'\n\nSeahawks general manager John Schneider and coach Mike Macdonald smiled while introducing their rookie first-round pick to Seattle for the first time Thursday.\n\n\"To be able to select Byron with the 16th pick, it was quite stressful, I've got to tell you,\" Schneider said, turning to his new defensive tackle. \"But I can't tell you how excited everybody is to have you here.\n\n\"On behalf of (team chair) Jody Allen, our family here in the building at the Virginia Mason Athletic Center and all the 12s, we want to welcome you.\"\n\nMurphy, in turn, introduced his mother, his father Byron Sr., and his girlfriend Maya Hurd - \"future wife,\" he said - to the dozens of reporters and Seahawks staff members inside the team's main auditorium meeting room.\n\n\"Really just blessed to be here,\" Murphy said.\n\n\"I'm going to give everything I've got each and every day, 110%.\"\n\nThe 6-foot and 1/2-inch, 297-pound Murphy turned to his new coach, Macdonald, and to his GM, Schneider, seated next to him on each side.\n\n\"I just want to say thanks to both of you guys for trusting in me, believing in me and picking me to be part of this team and everything. It really means a lot,\" Murphy said.\n\n\"It's a dream come true. Just blessed to be here.\"\n\nThe Seahawks also feel blessed - that the first 14 picks in the draft last week were offensive players. That pushed Murphy, the highest-rated and most disruptive defensive tackle in this draft, down to Seattle with the 16th pick.\n\n\"It was kind of like a game of Plinko on 'The Price is Right,' just trying to have everything slot out to work our way,\" Macdonald said Thursday. \"And when it became evident Byron was going to be our guy, it was just really exciting in the room.\"\n\nMacdonald said the night they drafted Murphy the Seahawks intend to use him and recently re-signed, $64 million tackle Leonard Williams the same way in 2024. That is, up and down the defensive line in different spots, almost by the down. A three-technique tackle between the guard and offensive tackle on one play, over the center as a nose or outside as a hybrid end the next.\n\n\"That's one of the reasons I'm so excited about it, is you're not going to know where guys are going to necessarily be all the time,\" Macdonald said. \"We'll have some really sweet ways to move guys around and have 'em in different spots based on the teams we're going to play.\n\n\"A lot of flexibility going in. A lot of pass-rush opportunities, match-ups, things we can manipulate. All that's on the table.\"\n\nHow about running back?\n\nThat's what Murphy was from 6 years old, when he played against 9- and 10-year-olds, through his freshman year at DeSoto High School.\n\nWhat does he remember about being 6 and playing football for the first time, against guys four years older?\n\n\"I just remember, really, dominating.,\" he said.\n\nMom and Dad laughed at that from the front row of the auditorium.\n\n\"I just remember scoring three, four touchdowns a game,\" he said. \"But it was crazy, 6, 7 years old going against 9-, 10-year olds, just being able to do that. I knew I was special right away, right then and there..\n\n\"Also, too, I knew when I first started playing, this is what I wanted to do.\"\n\nEven as a versatile nose tackle and outside tackle at Texas, Murphy played some running back for former University of Washington coach Steve Sarkisian. He scored a touchdown doing that in the Sugar Bowl against UW this past New Year's Night.\n\nIs Macdonald going to let new Seahawks offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb, from UW, get time with Murphy for running-back plays for Seattle this year?", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gregg_bell@theolympian.com", "name": "Gregg Bell",

So he had to move up in class and play against 9- and 10-year-olds.\n\nThursday, as he was officially introduced as one of the newest Seahawks in a news conference at the VMAC, the defensive lineman took a brief stroll down memory lane.\n\n\"I just remember really dominating,'' he said to laughter. \"Scoring three, four touchdowns a game. Man, it was crazy, you know, 7 years old going against 9- to 10-year-olds, just being able to do that. I knew I was special right away then.''\n\nAs the years went on, he'd think if someday there would be days like last Thursday, when he got the call from the Seahawks, who took him with the 16th overall pick, and days like this Thursday, when he took part in one of the rituals of being a first-round draft choice, happily holding up his new jersey for pictures with family and team officials.\n\n\"A dream come true,'' Murphy said.\n\nSoon will come the reality of adjusting to life in the NFL, which, even for the most promising of rookies, throws a few curveballs.\n\nMurphy and the rest of the Seahawks' eight-man draft class will hit the field at the VMAC on Friday afternoon as the team holds its annual rookie minicamp.\n\nSeahawks president of football operations John Schneider and new head coach Mike Macdonald professed no doubts that they got the right guy with their first pick.\n\nMany draft experts thought Murphy might go in the top 10, and the Seahawks figured he might, too.\n\nESPN reported Thursday that the Seahawks thought he would go to the Bears at pick No. 9 if Rome Odunze was off the board, but the UW receiver was there for the Bears to draft.\n\nAs Schneider said on the night of the draft, they had Murphy rated as the top defensive player on the board.\n\nHis potential as an immediate impact player, at the age of 21, led to Schneider declining what he said were four offers to trade back. \"Good ones, too,\" he said. ESPN reported those offers came from Pittsburgh (which had the 20th pick), Philadelphia (22), Minnesota (23) and Atlanta (43).\n\n\"He was always a guy throughout the season that we were always watching. Like, 'Are we in a position where we'll be able to draft him or not?'\" Schneider said. \"Not having a second-round draft pick [which they traded to the Giants to acquire Leonard Williams] really inhibited our ability to move up to take him. So we basically just prayed on it and sweated it out the other night.''\n\nThe Seahawks, who list Murphy at 6-foot, 306 pounds, envision him immediately becoming a key part of the interior defensive-line rotation along with veterans Williams, Jarran Reed, Dre'Mont Jones and Johnathan Hankins.\n\n\"A cool group,'' Schneider said.\n\nAnd one the Seahawks have invested in greatly to try to help Macdonald fulfill his quest of building a defense that is strong up the middle.\n\n\"I told some folks it was kind of like a game of Plinko on 'Price is Right,' just trying to have everything slot out to work our way,'' Macdonald said. \"And when it became evident Byron was going to be our guy, it was just really exciting in the room. ... We think Byron is the right person for our team.''\n\nWhile Murphy grew up in the Dallas suburb of DeSoto, Texas, he said, \"in my household, everybody disliked the Cowboys for some reason.''\n\nThat left Murphy to pick his own favorite team.

That's one of my goals. I'm trying to win games and bring a Super Bowl here, as well.''\n\nAt that time, Murphy thought he might be helping a team win a Super Bowl on the other side of the ball. His initial position was running back, which he played through ninth grade. He said his running style resembled that of another Seahawk -- Marshawn Lynch.\n\n\"I was a very physical runner,'' he said. \"I run through people, or I give you a little shake and bake. I feel like I had it all at running back.''\n\nAs he told the story Thursday, one day in practice he was asked to take a snap at nose tackle, and he responded by plowing through the offensive line to make a tackle for a loss.\n\nThe next day, a coach asked if he was willing to switch to the line permanently. After hesitating -- even though he weighed 250, he wondered if he was suited to play inside -- he said yes.\n\n\"When I told my parents, my parents went off on me,'' he said. \"They were mad and everything. But I was telling them, 'It's going to be OK. I'm going to do good at that position.'''\n\nCertainly, no one was complaining Thursday.\n\nMurphy began his news conference thanking his mom, Seneca, and dad, who were each in attendance along with his girlfriend, Maya Hurd, who he referred to as his future wife. Also with the group was his agent, Ron Slavin, there to oversee Murphy ironing out any remaining details on his contract, which is slotted as a four-year deal worth just over $16 million with an $8.5 million signing bonus.\n\n\"Growing up, Seattle has been my favorite team, so just to be a part of this team and this organization, it really means a lot,'' he said. \"I'm going to give everything I've got each and every day, 110%.\"", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

So he had to move up in class and play against 9- and 10-year-olds.\n\nThursday, as he was officially introduced as one of the newest Seahawks in a news conference at the VMAC, the defensive lineman took a brief stroll down memory lane.\n\n\"I just remember really dominating,'' he said to laughter. \"Scoring three, four touchdowns a game. Man, it was crazy, you know, 7 years old going against 9- to 10-year-olds, just being able to do that. I knew I was special right away then.''\n\nAs the years went on, he'd think if someday there would be days like last Thursday, when he got the call from the Seahawks who took him with the 16 overall pick, and days like this Thursday, when he took part in one of the rituals of being a first-round draft choice, happily holding up his new jersey for pictures with family and team officials.\n\n\"A dream come true,'' Murphy said.\n\nSoon will come the reality of adjusting to life in the NFL, which even for the most promising of rookies throws a few curveballs.\n\nMurphy and the rest of the Seahawks' eight-man draft class will hit the field at the VMAC on Friday afternoon as the team holds its annual rookie minicamp.\n\nSeahawks president of football operations John Schneider and new head coach Mike Macdonald professed no doubts that they got the right guy with their first pick.\n\nMany draft experts thought Murphy might go in the top 10, and the Seahawks figured he might, too.\n\nESPN reported Thursday that the Seahawks thought he would go to the Bears at nine if Rome Odunze was off the board, but the UW receiver lasted to nine and the Bears took him.\n\nAs Schneider said on the night of the draft, they had Murphy rated as the top defensive player on the board.\n\nHis potential as an immediate impact player, at the age of 21, led to Schneider declining what he said were four offers to trade back. \"Good ones, too,\" he said. ESPN reported those offers came from Pittsburgh (which had the 20 pick), Philadelphia (22), Minnesota (23) and Atlanta (43).\n\n\"He was always a guy throughout the season that we were always watching. Like, 'Are we in a position where we'll be able to draft him or not?'\" Schneider said. \"Not having a second-round draft pick (because of the Leonard Williams trade) really inhibited our ability to move up to take him. So we basically just prayed on it and sweated it out the other night.''\n\nThe Seahawks, who list Murphy at 6-foot, 306 pounds, envision him immediately becoming a key part of the interior defensive-line rotation along with veterans Williams, Jarran Reed, Dre'Mont Jones and Johnathan Hankins.\n\n\"A cool group,'' Schneider said.\n\nAnd one the Seahawks have invested in greatly to try to help Macdonald fulfill his quest of building a defense that is strong up the middle.\n\n\"I told some folks it was kind of like a game of Plinko on 'Price is Right,' just trying to have everything slot out to work our way,'' Macdonald said. \"And when it became evident Byron was going to be our guy, it was just really exciting in the room. ... We think Byron is the right person for our team.''\n\nWhile Murphy grew up in the Dallas suburb of DeSoto, Texas, he said \"in my household everybody disliked the Cowboys for some reason.''\n\nThat left Murphy to pick his own favorite team. And at the impressionable age of 11, he watched the Seahawks blast the Broncos in the Super Bowl and found one.\n\n\"I just fell in love with the Legion of Boom, the guys, just the way they played on defense, guys like Kam Chancellor, Bobby Wagner, Michael Bennett, all those guys, Richard Sherman, and just seeing how those guys play on defense, the way they just set the tone and go out there and just the way they play, that's something I wanted to be a part of,'' he said. \"And also, too, growing up, I was a huge fan of Russell Wilson. ...

That method is similar to how Bobby Wagner picked 54. He wore No. 9 in college, which at the time he couldn't wear in the NFL.\n\n-- Other rookie jersey numbers: guard Christian Haynes (64), tight end AJ Barner (88), cornerback D.J. James (29), tackle Michael Jerrell (65), linebacker Tyrice Knight (48), offensive lineman Sataoa Laumea (63), cornerback Nehemiah Pritchett (28).\n\n-- The NFL released dates for the rest of the offseason program. The Seahawks will host OTA (Organized Team Activities) May 20, 22-23, 28, 30-31 and June 3-4, 6-7. They will conclude their offseason program with a mandatory three-day minicamp June 11-13.\n\n-- The Seahawks waived rush end Levi Bell earlier this week. That dropped the team's roster to 73 and does not include undrafted free agents. Undrafted free agents signings will take the roster close to, if not at, the maximum of 90.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors":

(AP) -- When Byron Murphy II was presented with the idea of moving from the higher-profile position of linebacker to playing on the defensive line as a high schooler, he was at first a little reluctant but eventually accepted the move and what it could do for his career.\n\nHis parents' reaction when told he was becoming a defensive lineman?\n\n\"When I told my parents, my parents, they went off on me. They were mad,\" Murphy said with a chuckle on Thursday. \"I was telling them it was going to be OK. I'm going to do good at that position.\"\n\nClearly making the position switch ended up being the right move for Murphy after the Texas star was the second defensive player selected in last week's NFL draft. With a run of offensive talent dominating the first half of the first round, Murphy slid into the hands of the Seattle Seahawks with the No. 16 overall pick.\n\nFor new coach Mike Macdonald and his defensive background, landing perhaps the best defensive prospect in the draft in a spot where Seattle had no expectations of getting him ended up being a coup as part of the offseason remodel of the Seahawks' defense.\n\n\"He was a guy that throughout the season we were always watching like 'do we put ourselves in a position to where we'd be able to draft him or not?'\" Seattle general manager John Schneider said. \"Not having a second-round draft pick really inhibited our ability to move up to take him, so we basically prayed on it and sweated it out the other night.\"\n\nSeattle slow-played some of its interest in Murphy during the pre-draft process in part because it didn't think he'd last until the 16th pick. His interactions with the Seahawks were limited. He wasn't brought to Seattle for a pre-draft visit. His first time in the city was when he arrived in town for this weekend's rookie minicamp.\n\nHis impact should be immediate, especially with Macdonald intent on rotations along the defensive line. Murphy is likely the final piece to a group that includes Leonard Williams, Dre'Mont Jones and Jarran Reed as the primary contributors.\n\nGetting drafted by Seattle also tied Murphy to his favorite team growing up in the Dallas area. Rather than growing up a fan of the local team, Murphy was drawn to the \"Legion of Boom\" era of the Seahawks with the likes of Kam Chancellor, Marshawn Lynch, Michael Bennett, Bobby Wagner, Richard Sherman and Russell Wilson.\n\n\"Watching those guys go out there and dominate their opponents and win a Super Bowl, it was crazy. That's one of my goals.

Pretty much everyone he knew, met, has a coach and a teacher rooted for the hometown Cowboys.\n\nSame thing when he played at the University of Texas, a few hours down the interstate in Austin.\n\nNot Murphy. He's always loved...the Seattle Seahawks?\n\n\"I know it sounds a little funny. I get the question a lot: 'How come you didn't like the Cowboys?'\" Murphy said. \"But in my household everybody disliked the Cowboys for some reason.\n\n\"But, being a Seahawks fan just growing up, first, I just fell in love with the Legion of Boom, the guys, just the way they played on defense. Guys like Kam Chancellor, Bobby Wagner, Michael Bennett, all those guys, Richard Sherman. And just seeing how those guys play on defense, the way they just set the tone and go out there and just the way they play, that's something I wanted to be a part of.\n\n\"And also, too, growing up, I was a huge fan of Russell Wilson. I loved Russell Wilson as a kid, watching those guys go out there and just dominate their opponent and win a Super Bowl. It was crazy.\"\n\nSo was Thursday. Murphy, the man-child defensive tackle who was 250 pounds by 10th grade in DeSoto, the second defensive player picked in the NFL draft last week, was holding his new, blue, Seahawks jersey with new number 91 on it inside the team's headquarters.\n\nHis arm tattoo beneath his new Seahawks gear read: \"Humble Beast.\"\n\n\"It's a dream come true,\" he said.\n\nMurphy even opposed his mother with his Seahawks fandom growing up. Seneca Murphy liked Payton Manning and was rooting for the legendary quarterback and his Broncos in Super Bowl 48 a decade ago. Then-11-year-old Byron taunted Mom throughout the Seahawks' blowout of Denver in that Feb. 2014 title game.\n\nIt's still Seattle's only NFL championship.\n\n\"That's one of my goals. I'm trying to win games and bring a Super Bowl here, as well,\" Byron Murphy said.\n\nHis goals for his rookie season, in particular?\n\n\"First, I want to win. That's my main goal,\" he said. \"Secondly, hopefully I'll be able to win Defensive Rookie of the Year.\"\n\nByron Murphy 'blessed'\n\nSeahawks general manager John Schneider and coach Mike Macdonald smiled while introducing their rookie first-round pick to Seattle for the first time Thursday.\n\n\"To be able to select Byron with the 16th pick, it was quite stressful, I've got to tell you,\" Schneider said, turning to his new defensive tackle. \"But I can't tell you how excited everybody is to have you here.\n\n\"On behalf of (team chair) Jody Allen, our family here in the building at the Virginia Mason Athletic Center and all the 12s, we want to welcome you.\"\n\nMurphy, in turn, introduced his mother, his father Byron Sr., and his girlfriend Maya Hurd -- \"future wife,\" he said -- to the dozens of reporters and Seahawks staff members inside the team's main auditorium meeting room.\n\n\"Really just blessed to be here,\" Murphy said.\n\n\"I'm going to give everything I've got each and every day, 110%.\"\n\nThe 6-foot and 1/2-inch, 297-pound Murphy turned to his new coach, Macdonald, and to his GM, Schneider, seated next to him on each side.\n\n\"I just want to say thanks to both of you guys for trusting in me, believing in me and picking me to be part of this team and everything. It really means a lot,\" Murphy said.\n\n\"It's a dream come true. Just blessed to be here.\"\n\nThe Seahawks also feel blessed -- that the first 14 picks in the draft last week were offensive players. That pushed Murphy, the highest-rated and most disruptive defensive tackle in this draft, down to Seattle with the 16th pick.\n\n\"It was kind of like a game of Plinko on 'The Price is Right,' just trying to have everything slot out to work our way,\" Macdonald said Thursday. \"And when it became evident Byron was going to be our guy, it was just really exciting in the room.\"\n\nMacdonald said the night they drafted Murphy the Seahawks intend to use him and recently re-signed, $64 million tackle Leonard Williams the same way in 2024. That is, up and down the defensive line in different spots, almost by the down. A three-technique tackle between the guard and offensive tackle on one play, over the center as a nose or outside as a hybrid end the next.\n\n\"That's one of the reasons I'm so excited about it, is you're not going to know where guys are going to necessarily be all the time,\" Macdonald said. \"We'll have some really sweet ways to move guys around and have 'em in different spots based on the teams we're going to play.\n\n\"A lot of flexibility going in. A lot of pass-rush opportunities, match-ups, things we can manipulate. All that's on the table.\"\n\nHow about running back?\n\nThat's what Murphy was from 6 years old, when he played against 9- and 10-year-olds, through his freshman year at DeSoto High School.\n\nWhat does he remember about being 6 and playing football for the first time, against guys four years older.\n\n\"I just remember, really, dominating.,\" he said.\n\nMom and Dad laughed at that from the front row of the auditorium.\n\n\"I just remember scoring three, four touchdowns a game,\" he said. \"But it was crazy, 6, 7 years old going against 9-, 10-year olds, just being able to do that. I knew I was special right away, right then and there..\n\n\"Also, too, I knew when I first started playing, this is what I wanted to do.\"\n\nEven as a versatile nose tackle and outside tackle at Texas, Murphy played some running back for former University of Washington coach Steve Sarkisian. He scored a touchdown doing that in the Sugar Bowl against UW this past New Year's Night.\n\nIs Macdonald going to let new Seahawks offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb, from UW, get time with Murphy for running-back plays for Seattle this year?", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gregg_bell@theolympian.com", "name": "Gregg Bell",

(AP) - When Byron Murphy II was presented with the idea of moving from the higher-profile position of linebacker to playing on the defensive line as a high schooler, he was at first a little reluctant but eventually accepted the move and what it could do for his career.\n\nHis parents' reaction when told he was becoming a defensive lineman?\n\n\"When I told my parents, my parents, they went off on me. They were mad,\" Murphy said with a chuckle on Thursday. \"I was telling them it was going to be OK. I\u00b4m going to do good at that position.\"\n\nClearly making the position switch ended up being the right move for Murphy after the Texas star was the second defensive player selected in last week\u00b4s NFL draft. With a run of offensive talent dominating the first half of the first round, Murphy slid into the hands of the Seattle Seahawks with the No. 16 overall pick.\n\nFor new coach Mike Macdonald and his defensive background, landing perhaps the best defensive prospect in the draft in a spot where Seattle had no expectations of getting him ended up being a coup as part of the offseason remodel of the Seahawks' defense.\n\n\"He was a guy that throughout the season we were always watching like 'do we put ourselves in a position to where we\u00b4d be able to draft him or not?\u00b4\" Seattle general manager John Schneider said. \"Not having a second-round draft pick really inhibited our ability to move up to take him, so we basically prayed on it and sweated it out the other night.\"\n\nSeattle Seahawks 2024 first round draft pick, Byron Murphy II, smiles during a news conference at the NFL team's headquarters, Thursday, May 2, 2024, in Renton, Wash. (AP Photo/John Froschauer)\n\nSeattle slow-played some of its interest in Murphy during the pre-draft process in part because it didn\u00b4t think he\u00b4d last until the 16th pick. His interactions with the Seahawks were limited. He wasn\u00b4t brought to Seattle for a pre-draft visit. His first time in the city was when he arrived in town for this weekend\u00b4s rookie minicamp.\n\nHis impact should be immediate, especially with Macdonald intent on rotations along the defensive line. Murphy is likely the final piece to a group that includes Leonard Williams, Dre\u00b4Mont Jones and Jarran Reed as the primary contributors.\n\nGetting drafted by Seattle also tied Murphy to his favorite team growing up in the Dallas area. Rather than growing up a fan of the local team, Murphy was drawn to the \"Legion of Boom\" era of the Seahawks with the likes of Kam Chancellor, Marshawn Lynch, Michael Bennett, Bobby Wagner, Richard Sherman and Russell Wilson.\n\n\"Watching those guys go out there and dominate their opponents and win a Super Bowl, it was crazy. That\u00b4s one of my goals. I\u00b4m trying to win games and bring a Super Bowl here as well,\" Murphy said.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nSeattle Seahawks 2024 first round draft pick, Byron Murphy II, left, listens as a head coach Mike Macdonald, right, speaks during a news conference at the NFL team's headquarters, Thursday, May 2, 2024, in Renton, Wash.

However, if they want to sign anybody else this year then they're going to have to shuffle some money around. According to the latest figures at Over the Cap, Seattle has just $1.5 million in space leftover for the 2024 season. There's no need to worry, though. As general manager John Schneider mentioned last week, there are some moves that the franchise can make to create the cap space they need. Here are four.\n\nSeahawks updated 90-man roster by jersey number with UDFAs\n\nRestructure WR DK Metcalf\n\nNov 30, 2023; Arlington, Texas, USA; Seattle Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf (14) catches a pass for a touchdown during the second half against the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe easiest move that Schneider can make to create some breathing room is restructuring the contract of star wide receiver DK Metcalf. According to Over the Cap, the team would save $5,937,500 for the 2024 season with this one.\n\nRestructure DE Dre'Mont Jones\n\nNov 30, 2023; Arlington, Texas, USA; Seattle Seahawks defensive end Dre'Mont Jones (55) reacts during the first half against the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIn our last article on potential salary cap-saving moves, we suggested trading defensive end Dre'Mont Jones. That didn't happen, but Seattle could still save a bunch of money this year by restructuring his contract. OTC says the team can save another $4,937,500 with this move.\n\nCut NT Jarran Reed\n\nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON - OCTOBER 29: Jarran Reed #90 of the Seattle Seahawks looks on prior to a game against the Cleveland Browns at Lumen Field on October 29, 2023 in Seattle, Washington. (Photo by Jane Gershovich/Getty Images)\n\nBy drafting Byron Murphy II the Seahawks got another versatile disruptor up front, one who can play 3-tech as well as nose tackle. That might enable them to cut their current starting nose tackle Jarran Reed, which would save the team $4,870,000.\n\nExtend S Julian Love\n\nOct 29, 2023; Seattle, Washington, USA; Seattle Seahawks safety Julian Love (20) celebrates after intercepting the ball against the Cleveland Browns during the second half at Lumen Field. Mandatory Credit: Steven Bisig-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Seahawks decided not to draft any safeties this year, which raises questions about their depth beyond the 2025 season. If they give an extension to Pro Bowler Julian Love, it could save another $3,100,000, according to Over the Cap.\n\nNov 30, 2023; Arlington, Texas, USA; Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott (4) passes the ball while pressured by Seattle Seahawks linebacker Boye Mafe (53) during the first half at AT&T Stadium.

Aside from two corners late in the draft, every pick addressed needs on the offensive and defensive front. Head coach Mike Macdonald made it explicitly clear they are looking for a certain type of player.\n\nThe message was sent with the first pick of the draft, defensive tackle Byron Murphy II at No. 16 overall. The Seahawks stayed put despite strong offers to move back. While I'm sure every 12th Man is happy about the acquisition of Murphy, it is only natural to wonder what the path not taken might have looked like. Well, according to Brady Henderson at ESPN, the Seahawks would have stayed in the trenches.\n\n\"Their other top target, according to sources inside the draft room, was Alabama offensive tackle JC Latham, who would have slid inside to guard to fill what was arguably the team's top need...\"\n\nMacdonald is not playing around when he says he is looking for toughness, and it is what Seattle desperately needs up front on both sides of the ball.

James, leading to speculation that a move might be made at that spot to create salary-cap space.\n\nAnd on Monday it was learned the Seahawks indeed had redone the contract of veteran cornerback Michael Jackson to open up almost $2 million in cap space. The cap space was needed as the Seahawks begin signing their draft picks.\n\nJackson's new contract was udpated on OvertheCap.com, and it was confirmed by a league source.\n\nJackson this spring signed a restricted free-agent tender that would have given him a salary of just over $3.1 million if he makes the 53-man roster -- but contained no guaranteed money.\n\nAll of that counted against the cap for now, though.\n\nThe Seahawks cut that cap number significantly by signing Jackson to a new deal that is worth $1.22 million and gives him a $167,500 signing bonus.\n\nIn the process, they went from $300,000 over the cap to just over $1.5 million under it, according to OvertheCap.com.\n\nThe Seahawks needed to do something after signing first-round pick Byron Murphy II to his slotted four-year rookie deal Friday, which counts for $2.94 million against the cap.\n\nJackson's new deal makes it clearer that he will be in a stiff fight for a roster spot in training camp.\n\nSeattle has a projected top three of Devon Witherspoon, Tre Brown and Riq Woolen at cornerback. Nine other players are listed as cornerbacks on the roster: Jackson, James, Pritchett, Artie Burns, Lance Boykin and Andrew Whitaker, as well as undrafted free agent signees Ro Torrence and Carlton Johnson and Coby Bryant (who is listed as a corner and safety but could be used more at safety).\n\nJackson has played right and left cornerback with the Seahawks, starting on the left side in 2022 when Woolen emerged as the starter on the right side and for three games late in the 2023 season due to injuries. But he was listed as the backup on the right side for most of the season and started a game there. He most likely will compete for a backup spot on the right side. Pritchett played primarily on the right side in rookie minicamp last weekend.\n\nThe Seahawks have typically kept five cornerbacks and sometimes six on their 53-man roster and usually have two and sometimes three on the 16-man practice squad.\n\nThe 27-year-old Jackson, a sixth-year veteran, started all 17 games for the Seahawks in 2022 and four games last season. He moved to a reserve/rotational role last season after the drafting of Witherspoon and return to health of Brown.\n\nSeahawks president of football operations John Schneider said during an appearance on Seattle Sports 710 last week that the team was \"tight\" against the cap but had plans on how to create space.\n\nJackson's contract was the first move, but there could be other restructures or re-workings of contracts as the Seahawks sign the rest of their eight draft picks.\n\nPenny to sign with Panthers\n\nFormer Seahawks running back Rashaad Penny, the team's first pick in the 2018 draft, \"plans to sign\" with the Carolina Panthers, according to ESPN.\n\nPenny played for the Seahawks from 2018-22 and is the 12th-leading rusher in team history with 1,918 yards. He signed a one-year deal for the 2023 season with the Eagles but played sparingly, on the field for just 38 snaps and gaining only 33 yards on 11 carries despite being healthy.\n\nPenny visited the Seahawks last month, and Schneider said after the draft that the door remained open for him to return.\n\nBut Penny is heading to Carolina, where he will be reunited with new coach Dave Canales, who was a Seahawks assistant during Penny's time in Seattle. The Panthers have five other offensive assistants who were with the Seahawks during the Pete Carroll era.\n\nThe Seahawks have six running backs on their roster -- returners Kenneth Walker III, Zach Charbonnet and Kenny McIntosh and undrafted rookie free agent signees George Holani of Boise State, Kobe Lewis of Florida Atlantic and TaMerik Williams of North Dakota State.\n\nAccording to the NFL Network, Holani received $115,000 to sign -- a $15,000 bonus and $100,000 in guaranteed salary.\n\nSeahawks projected for two comp picks in 2025\n\nThe deadline has passed for when the signings of unrestricted free agents factor into the formula for determining 2025 compensatory draft picks.\n\nUnder the formula, teams receive picks as compensation for what is determined to be an overall loss of unrestricted free agents.\n\nAccording to OvertheCap.com, the Seahawks are projected to receive a fourth-round pick for the loss of guard Damien Lewis to Carolina and a fifth-rounder for the loss of Jordyn Brooks to Miami. Other free-agent losses were offset by free agents the Seahawks signed.\n\nThat leaves them with a projected eight picks for the 2025 draft. They are scheduled to have all of their own other than a fifth-rounder sent to the New York Giants last October as part of the Leonard Williams trade.\n\nThat is the only future Seahawks pick that they have traded.\n\nThe Seahawks did not have any compensatory picks in 2024 but worked their way to eight picks through a couple of trades.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType":

But as he prepares to begin his NFL career with the Seattle Seahawks, Byron Murphy II finds himself as one of the few fortunate first-round picks who will benefit from an experienced, talented defensive line to learn from.\n\nComing to the Pacific Northwest, while he plans to be a difference-making factor as a rookie, the 21-year old Murphy will have a chance to develop properly without having the burden of being a savior on day one thanks to the presence of seasoned veterans Leonard Williams and Jarran Reed.\n\n\"It's a great feeling knowing I'm playing with some dogs on the side of me,\" Murphy said during his introductory press conference on Thursday at the VMAC. \"Being able to play with these guys at a very young age, I know they're gonna teach me a lot, show me a lot, and teach me about the game and how to move on and off the field.\"\n\nGoing into last week's draft, defensive tackle didn't stand out as one of Seattle's most glaring needs. Earlier in the offseason, general manager John Schneider re-signed Williams, who was acquired at the trade deadline from the New York Giants last October, to a massive three-year, $64.5 million contract. In addition, Reed has one year left on his current deal and Dre'Mont Jones will look to bounce back from a somewhat quiet first year with the team.\n\nBetween those three players, the Seahawks have 288 NFL starts and 104 combined sacks atop the depth chart, giving them one of the most veteran-laden, productive interior defensive lines in the NFC. Individually, Williams had four sacks and 11 quarterback hits in just 10 games after the midseason trade last fall, while Reed produced seven sacks in a resurgeant season, the second-highest total in a season in his career.\n\nBut despite Reed and Williams playing at a high level, Seattle still self-destructed defending the run, ranking dead last in rushing yards, yards per carry, and rushing touchdowns allowed from Week 8 on. With both of those players now being north of 30 years old and Jones entering a critical season after only producing 4.5 sacks in 2023, the opportunity to select Murphy 16th overall was \"too good\" for Schneider and coach Mike Macdonald to pass up even as other teams tried to trade up and made solid offers to do so.\n\nAfter taking the call from Schneider on Thursday night, it's been a whirlwind for Murphy, a self-proclaimed Seahawks fan, as he prepared to leave the hot weather of Texas for the Emerald City, which he had never visited before. Soaking in the experience with his parents, girlfriend, and agent in attendance on week later, he was all smiles at podium fielding questions from reporters for the first time.\n\n\"The last few days, it's been crazy,\" Murphy remarked. \"Even starting from Thursday, getting the phone call, it was so overwhelming. I can't really describe it, it was like a dream. But when I got the call, I was so excited and happy and really thankful to share that moment with my family.\"\n\nExcited to jump to the NFL with the franchise he grew up rooting for in DeSoto, Texas, Murphy expects the game to be much faster than playing against Big 12 competition, which he dominated earning Defensive Player of the Year honors and First-Team All-Conference distinction. After being a starter only one year in his three seasons with the Longhorns, albeit a highly successful year in Austin, he knows there will undoubtedly be a learning curve he has to navigate as all rookies do.\n\nThat isn't lowering Murphy's own personal expectations, however.\n\nAside from stating his desire to lead the Seahawks back to the Super Bowl to win another Lombardi Trophy as his childhood idols Michael Bennett and company did 10 years ago, Murphy hopes to win Defensive Rookie of the Year, which would be a first in franchise history. Landing in an ideal place to push for those goals with ample support around him, he believes having willing mentors in Williams and Reed to lean on will help expedite the process as he acclimates to his new home.\n\n\"Jarran Reed, Leonard Williams, both of those guys hit me up. They're just ready for me to come down here and they're ready to work, they're ready to work with me,\" Murphy said.\n\nWith rookie minicamp starting on Friday, Murphy will have his first opportunity to don a Seahawks helmet and practice jersey, making the experience feel far more real after arriving at the team facility earlier this week. As Schneider joked, eventually he will have a pen in his hand with a first-round contract to sign, adding another milestone to the start of his NFL career in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nWhile that will happen in the near future, or at least before training camp opens in late July, Murphy has his sights solely focused on getting off to a quick start with his new team. Once he starts practicing alongside Williams and Reed at OTAs later this month and absorbing as much knowledge as he can from them as an apprentice in the trenches, he plans to hit the ground running as he aims to carve out a significant role on Seattle's defensive line right away.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "corbin_k_smith@si.com", "name": "Corbin K.

The Seahawks stayed put despite strong offers to move back.

James, leading to speculation that a move might be made at that spot to create salary-cap space.\n\nAnd on Monday it was learned the Seahawks indeed had redone the contract of veteran cornerback Michael Jackson to open up almost $2 million in cap space. The cap space was needed as the Seahawks begin signing their draft picks.\n\nJackson's new contract was udpated on OvertheCap.com, and it was confirmed by a league source.\n\nJackson this spring signed a restricted free-agent tender that would have given him a salary of just over $3.1 million if he makes the 53-man roster -- but contained no guaranteed money.\n\nAll of that counted against the cap for now, though.\n\nThe Seahawks cut that cap number significantly by signing Jackson to a new deal that is worth $1.22 million and gives him a $167,500 signing bonus.\n\nIn the process, they went from $300,000 over the cap to just over $1.5 million under it, according to OvertheCap.com.\n\nThe Seahawks needed to do something after signing first-round pick Byron Murphy II to his slotted four-year rookie deal Friday, which counts for $2.94 million against the cap.\n\nJackson's new deal makes it clearer that he will be in a stiff fight for a roster spot in training camp.\n\nSeattle has a projected top three of Devon Witherspoon, Tre Brown and Riq Woolen at cornerback. Nine other players are listed as cornerbacks on the roster: Jackson, James, Pritchett, Artie Burns, Lance Boykin and Andrew Whitaker, as well as undrafted free agent signees Ro Torrence and Carlton Johnson and Coby Bryant (who is listed as a corner and safety but could be used more at safety).\n\nJackson has played right and left cornerback with the Seahawks, starting on the left side in 2022 when Woolen emerged as the starter on the right side and for three games late in the 2023 season due to injuries. But he was listed as the backup on the right side for most of the season and started a game there. He most likely will compete for a backup spot on the right side. Pritchett played primarily on the right side in rookie minicamp last weekend.\n\nThe Seahawks have typically kept five cornerbacks and sometimes six on their 53-man roster and usually have two and sometimes three on the 16-man practice squad.\n\nThe 27-year-old Jackson, a sixth-year veteran, started all 17 games for the Seahawks in 2022 and four games last season. He moved to a reserve/rotational role last season after the drafting of Witherspoon and return to health of Brown.\n\nSeahawks president of football operations John Schneider said during an appearance on Seattle Sports 710 last week that the team was \"tight\" against the cap but had plans on how to create space.\n\nJackson's contract was the first move, but there could be other restructures or re-workings of contracts as the Seahawks sign the rest of their eight draft picks.\n\nPenny to sign with Panthers\n\nFormer Seahawks running back Rashaad Penny, the team's first pick in the 2018 draft, \"plans to sign\" with the Carolina Panthers, according to ESPN.\n\nPenny played for the Seahawks from 2018-22 and is the 12-leading rusher in team history with 1,918 yards. He signed a one-year deal for the 2023 season with the Eagles but played sparingly, on the field for just 38 snaps and gaining only 33 yards on 11 carries despite being healthy.\n\nPenny visited the Seahawks last month, and Schneider said after the draft that the door remained open for him to return.\n\nBut Penny is heading to Carolina, where he will be reunited with new coach Dave Canales, who was a Seahawks assistant during Penny's time in Seattle. The Panthers have five other offensive assistants who were with the Seahawks during the Pete Carroll era.\n\nThe Seahawks have six running backs on their roster -- returners Kenneth Walker III, Zach Charbonnet and Kenny McIntosh and undrafted rookie free agent signees George Holani of Boise State, Kobe Lewis of Florida Atlantic and TaMerik Williams of North Dakota State.\n\nAccording to the NFL Network, Holani received $115,000 to sign -- a $15,000 bonus and $100,000 in guaranteed salary.\n\nSeahawks projected for two comp picks in 2025\n\nThe deadline has passed for when the signings of unrestricted free agents factor into the formula for determining 2025 compensatory draft picks.\n\nUnder the formula, teams receive picks as compensation for what is determined to be an overall loss of unrestricted free agents.\n\nAccording to OvertheCap.com, the Seahawks are projected to receive a fourth-round pick for the loss of guard Damien Lewis to Carolina and a fifth-rounder for the loss of Jordyn Brooks to Miami. Other free-agent losses were offset by free agents the Seahawks signed.\n\nThat leaves them with a projected eight picks for the 2025 draft. They are scheduled to have all of their own other than a fifth-rounder sent to the New York Giants last October as part of the Leonard Williams trade.\n\nThat is the only future Seahawks pick that they have traded.\n\nThe Seahawks did not have any compensatory picks in 2024 but worked their way to eight picks through a couple of trades.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType":

Where does that put them among the rest of the league?\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks ranked 25th in the NFL in points allowed last season, but that's expected to change in 2024. In order to reverse their fortunes in that department, the Seahawks hired Mike Macdonald, who coordinated the Baltimore Ravens defense. His unit allowed the fewest points in the league last year.\n\nThe addition of Macdonald is part of the reason why the Seahawks are ranked a little higher than their points allowed ranking in Bleacher Report's defense power rankings. The Seahawks clocked in at No. 20.\n\n\"It's not surprising that the Seahawks turned things over to a defensive head coach in Mike Macdonald this offseason. The defense was the Achilles heel throughout the year, finishing toward the bottom of the league in most metrics. But Macdonald's quick turnaround of the Ravens defense as their coordinator last season brings hope he can do the same in Seattle,\" Bleacher Report writes.\n\nThe Seahawks certainly prioritized defense in last month's draft, selecting four players highlighed by first-round defensive tackle Byron Murphy II. However, arguably the biggest facet the team needs to change is third down.\n\n\"Macdonald's first order of business is going to be improving the third-down defense. The Seahawks were 31st in third-down defense, allowing teams to convert nearly half the time,\" Bleacher Report writes.\n\nUltimately, stopping opposing offenses on third down requires the defensive line, linebackers and secondary. All 11 players have to do their part in order to succeed, so finding ways to improve each unit is a step in the right direction for the Seahawks to get better in stopping the ball.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_brener@si.com", "name": "Jeremy Brener", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5552,h_3123,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx7rjcdpqt2bdbggn4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9534980", "eventUri": "eng-9534980", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Unfortunately, their efforts have not been as fruitful as they've hoped, as the group up front has been bullied by opposing offenses for the better part of two full seasons now.\n\nHopefully, this is about to change. Seattle has slowly assembled a talented position group, headlined by Leonard Williams, Jarran Reed, Dre'Mont Jones and now Byron Murphy - the team's first pick from the 2024 NFL draft. So far, new head coach Mike Macdonald is thrilled with what he has to work with. Macdonald recently raved about the flexibility he has at the position, per Brady Henderson at ESPN:\n\n\"We have a lot of guys... That's one of the reasons I'm so excited about it, is you're not going to know where guys are necessarily going to be all the time. We'll have some really sweet ways to move guys around and have them in different spots based on the teams we're going to play. A lot of flexibility going in, a lot of pass-rush opportunities, matchups, things we can manipulate. So all that's on the table. It'll be fun to see how it shakes out.\"\n\nUsually, when teams have openings at the head coach position, they are teams starting from the bottom. A team that cratered and is looking for a fresh start. The Seahawks were not of this typical mold. The cupboard is not bare, which is why they were probably able to land the best coaching candidate available in Macdonald.\n\nThere is no doubt this roster will likely undergo major changes this year, and in following seasons, as Macdonald molds it to his image. But for now, he is not starting from the ground up. There are legitimate building blocks in place for a solid foundation.\n\nMore Seahawks Wire stories\n\nUpdated Seahawks 90-man roster by jersey # with UDFAs\n\nRussell Wilson gets another pay-day from selling home in Bellevue\n\n53-man roster projection for Seahawks after the NFL draft\n\nSeahawks announce they signed 16 undrafted free agents\n\n2024 NFL draft grades for all 32 teams: Who got top marks?", "source": {"uri": "seahawkswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Seahawks Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kole_musgrove@seahawkswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Kole Musgrove", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarran_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarran Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bellevue, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bellevue, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://seahawkswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2023/11/USATSI_21885504.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9534980", "eventUri": "eng-9534980", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

He becomes the first member of the Seahawks latest draft class to sign the dotted line.\n\nEarning All-American and All-Big 12 honors as a junior at Texas, Murphy broke out as one of the most disruptive interior defenders in college football last season, helping guide the Longhorns to a College Football Playoff berth. He finished with 29 tackles, five sacks, and 8.5 tackles for loss while ranking in the top five among defensive linemen in quarterback pressures, pass rush win rate, and pass rush productivity rating according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nViewed as one of the top defenders in this year's draft class, the Seahawks didn't expect Murphy to be available when they were on the clock with the 16th overall selection. However, thanks to a historic start to the draft where 14 consecutive offensive players, including six quarterbacks, were selected to open the first round, he fell into their lap once the Colts chose UCLA edge rusher Laiatu Latu.\n\nEven with other teams inquiring with what general manager John Schneider called \"strong\" trade offers and the Seahawks lacking a second-round selection, Murphy's talent and upside proved too good to pass up and they quickly submitted his name as the choice.\n\nLooking every bit like a blue-chip first-round pick at the VMAC on Friday, the powerful, athletic 297-pound Murphy will immediately be thrust into the competition for snaps in a veteran-laden defensive line headlined by Leonard Williams, Jarran Reed, and Dre'Mont Jones. While he's expected to primarily play the 3-tech/4i defensive tackle role, he played nose tackle at Texas and also has the positional versatility to slide outside as a big 5-tech defensive end, so he could be moved around.\n\nBy signing Murphy just one week after drafting him, the Seahawks won't have to worry about negotiations on offsetting money and signing bonus payout as they did last year when top-five pick Devon Witherspoon held out the first two days of training camp before eventually signing. With his contract signed, sealed, and delivered, the focus can shift to locking up the rest of their draft class and making corresponding moves to create enough cap space to do so.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "corbin_k_smith@si.com", "name": "Corbin K.

Unfortunately, their efforts have not been as fruitful as they've hoped, as the group up front has been bullied by opposing offenses for the better part of two full seasons now.\n\nHopefully, this is about to change. Seattle has slowly assembled a talented position group, headlined by Leonard Williams, Jarran Reed, Dre'Mont Jones and now Byron Murphy - the team's first pick from the 2024 NFL draft. So far, new head coach Mike Macdonald is thrilled with what he has to work with. Macdonald recently raved about the flexibility he has at the position, per Brady Henderson at ESPN:\n\n\"We have a lot of guys... That's one of the reasons I'm so excited about it, is you're not going to know where guys are necessarily going to be all the time. We'll have some really sweet ways to move guys around and have them in different spots based on the teams we're going to play. A lot of flexibility going in, a lot of pass-rush opportunities, matchups, things we can manipulate. So all that's on the table. It'll be fun to see how it shakes out.\"\n\nUsually, when teams have openings at the head coach position, they are teams starting from the bottom. A team that cratered and is looking for a fresh start. The Seahawks were not of this typical mold. The cupboard is not bare, which is why they were probably able to land the best coaching candidate available in Macdonald.\n\nThere is no doubt this roster will likely undergo major changes this year, and in following seasons, as Macdonald molds it to his image. But for now, he is not starting from the ground up. There are legitimate building blocks in place for a solid foundation.\n\nMore Seahawks Wire stories\n\nUpdated Seahawks 90-man roster by jersey # with UDFAs\n\n53-man roster projection for Seahawks after the NFL draft", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Williams_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leonard Williams (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarran_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarran Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EioKMMViV.gDStRvCyXAEg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/seattle_seahawks_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_798/33453df2b4b5a0d8525ff06edc5604be", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9534980", "eventUri": "eng-9534980", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The entire time, the Murphy family was brimming with joy celebrating Byron II's big moment.\n\nGetting drafted into the NFL isn't just a surreal moment for Byron II, but for the entire Murphy family as well. On Thursday, the family opened up about how much this new chapter truly means.\n\n\"It was something we've been waiting for,\" Seneca said, via Seahawks.com. \"This is the ultimate goal for what he's been wanting to achieve, and he finally reached that ultimate goal of being a professional. And being picked and not only being picked but being picked in the first round, and not only the first round but the top 20. I was happy... That's a blessing not many people get to experience.\"\n\nDespite being the first defensive tackle and second defensive player in general to go off the board, Byron II actually went a bit later than some projections had him going.

Specifically, the interior. It has just not been able to hold up against the San Francisco 49ers or Los Angeles Rams for several years now.\n\nSo what did they do to address this need? Why, they went out and picked the best guard available in the 2024 NFL draft. Selecting a quality guard is never a flashy or \"fun\" pick, but they are necessary, and it seems Seattle got quite the steal in the third round.\n\nNaturally, Christian Haynes' coach from UConn raved about his former player, and should get every 12 excited.\n\nNaturally, hearing a rookie will need to work on his pass protection skills is not unheard of. Facing off against defensive linemen in the NFL is certainly a taller task than in college, especially the defenders UConn would have faced.

That makes sense, as Murphy is considered by some analysts (including Seattle's front office) to be the best defensive player in this draft class. The next pick the team made was a guard two rounds later, so the rest of the group will likely fly under the radar the entire offseason.\n\nThe Seahawks did make some interesting picks on Day 3 with strong sleeper potential, though. According to a list by Doug Farrar at Touchdown Wire, Auburn cornerback Nehemiah Pritchett was the best sleeper pick by Seattle.\n\n\"As far as we know, Pritchett's opponents kept all their body parts last season, but they didn't have a lot of production. Pritchett allowed 12 catches on 26 targets for 134 yards, 25 yards after the catch, one touchdown, one interception, three pass breakups, and an opponent passer rating of 58.8. Over five seasons with the Tigers, Pritchett allowed an opponent passer rating of 69.2.\"\n\nPromising as he is, fans shouldn't expect Pritchett to start right away.\n\nAccording to the Seattle Times, Pritchett played mostly right cornerback during rookie minicamp behind Riq Woolen, while his teammate from college D.J.

And if Murphy is pissed that he fell that far, even better.\n\nMurphy, who has signed his rookie contract, is participating in the team's rookie minicamp. On Saturday, coach Mike Macdonald shared his first impression of the potentially dominant defender.\n\n\"Tough to really truly evaluate because of the tempo, but overall, a good start,\" Macdonald told reporters. \"We're not going to crown him right now like he's the next best defensive tackle of all time, but we're really excited about it. He shows all the bend and the strength at the point of attack and acceleration.

Once you have actually reached this level the true stars are separated from the herd by how badly they want to be the best at what they do. It sounds like the Seahawks got the right guy in that department when they picked Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II in the first round of the 2024 NFL draft.\n\nMurphy hasn't even played a single game yet and he already has a chip on his shoulder. Over the weekend the NFL's official Twitter account shared a list of possible Defensive Rookie of the Year candidates. Murphy was not included and he took the time to point out the perceived disrespect.\n\nYou love to see it.\n\nThis is the same energy that last year's first pick - cornerback Devon Witherspoon shared when he finished fourth in the 2023 Defensive Rookie of the Year voting.

There's a chance they could take the second or third defensive player of the year - at 16!\n\nIt's unusual to say the least, and since they don't need a receiver or (hopefully) a tackle, it works in their favor. Besides Troy Fautanu, it means that positional leaders like Byron Murphy II, Jared Verse, or Laiatu Latu might all be in play when otherwise it would be more likely that only one of their ilk would be around by then.\n\nIf Schneider picks at 16, it's going to be for someone with a real first-round grade. Perhaps that's what they feel they need to start this new era.\n\nThe highlight of both Henderson's piece and Mookie's follow-up were the five teams that looked into trading up to the Seattle pick. Schneider claims he gave strong consideration, but that the player was \"too good.\" They didn't need the extra capital as much as they might if they were...bad.\n\nIt's the second time the top brass has indicated the Hawks are not in a rebuild. Nobody's saying they were one defensive lineman away, but it certainly seems they're saying the new coaching staff plus a few pieces will have them closer to the top than last season.\n\nBy not going Jared Verse or anyone else as an outside pass-rusher in the draft, the Seahawks reinforced something Macdonald has been preaching since before he got here. He wants to be extremely stout up the middle, force everything to the outside.\n\nWith a slew of investments over previous two years in Boye Mafe, Darrell Taylor, Uchenna Nwosu, and Derick Hall, coach Macdonald apparently feels confident they'll be able to get value out of the current rotation.\n\nConversely, one could argue the two biggest moves that have been made with him as head coach are signing Leonard Williams and drafting Byron Murphy.\n\nHenderson's insight about injury concerns was telling. It's the polar opposite of what happened with, say, Darrell Taylor a couple years back. This time, to not have Laiatu Latu on the board makes sense but I'm sure not entertaining Troy Fautanu surprised a great deal of fans.\n\nAdditionally, while it's impossible to say anyone is a \"safe\" pick, Murphy is far more of a traditional immediate-value type of selection. Even Devon Witherspoon at No. 5 last year was questionable in some circles for the simple fact that a corner can be out-schemed in a way that a defensive tackle cannot. Witherspoon showed how he's able to impact the game on a per-play basis, which is not always a given in the way that the guy bulldozing the center to smack the quarterback.\n\nThe team opted for immediate playmaking at the anchor point of the line, and it's something we've watched the NFC West rivals do for years.

He got drafted by the team he already claimed fandom over and is landing in a place where the culture has been established.

Byron Murphy II, Seattle's top draft pick, says one of his goals is to win that award.\n\nThe NFL's X/Twitter account sent out a post asking for predictions on who wins DROY for 2024. The graphic highlights Laiatu Latu, Dallas Turner, Jared Verse, Chop Robinson, Quinton Mitchell, and Terrion Arnold. Everyone is a first-round pick, sure, but it seems a bit weird that the second defensive player drafted is an omission.\n\nYou know who did take notice?

Jalen Carter didn't win the award last season but he was at the runner-up to Will Anderson.

How did each draft pick fare?", "body": "Will the Seahawks' 2024 draft class truly prove that eight was enough? Will they maybe someday go down as the Great Eight?\n\nFar better questions than those will have to be answered first over the next few years before we can gauge the legacy of this draft class.\n\nNew head coach Mike Macdonald and his staff, though, began to get at least something of a feel for what they have in their new players when the Seahawks held their annual rookie minicamp Friday and Saturday.\n\nHere is a look at how camp went for each draft pick.\n\nDefensive tackle Byron Murphy II (first round, 16 overall): That the camp is held without pads, with no contact and generally at not quite regular-season tempo, with an emphasis on teaching, can make it difficult to gauge much about linemen.\n\nBut as expected, Murphy worked at the interior defensive line spots and in general gave off a positive first impression with a caveat offered about the kind of shape he'll need to be in to get through an NFL season.\n\n\"Overall, a good start,'' Macdonald said. \"We're not going to crown him right now like he's the next best defensive tackle of all time, but we're really excited about it. He shows all the bend and the strength at the point of attack and acceleration. Need to get in a little bit better shape, so we can get through a whole practice and fly around like we expect him to. But he understands that just like the rest of these guys. It's so hard to stay in this elite shape the way the (pre-draft) calendar is set up. So he'll get there. But we'll be pushing them in the meantime. ''\n\nMurphy said his initial view of the Seahawks defense is that it will fit him well.\n\n\"I feel like the scheme, the defense we run, the position I am in, will create a lot of one-on-one's for me,'' he said \"With one-on-one's, I feel like I can get a lot of sacks and have successful seasons and a successful career.\"\n\nGuard Christian Haynes (third round, 81 overall): Haynes spent most of his time playing right guard, which is expected to be his primary position and where he will compete for a starting spot with Anthony Bradford and maybe Tremayne Anchrum Jr, as well. Haynes also saw a few snaps at left guard.\n\n\"Just technique-wise learning what the coaches want and showing that I can still move my feet, have my hands in the right placements,'' Haynes said of his goal for the camp. \"Showing that I am able to (be) a technique-sound player.\"\n\nLinebacker Tyrice Knight (fourth round, 118 overall): As expected, the UTEP product spent the weekend working almost exclusively at weakside linebacker, where his initial role figures to be adding depth behind veteran free agent signee Jerome Baker and playing on most special teams.\n\n\"Tyrice made some good plays,'' Macdonald said after Saturday's practice. \"Today, we had a little bit of an install. So there was a couple mental errors that we want to chase. Again, the intent is there, the attention to detail is there. Keep working on all the movement, playing like a linebacker in the NFL. Just like everybody else on the team, those are the things that are going to be really important for us to do so. And he sees that, so we'll go to work on it.''\n\nTight end AJ Barner (fourth round, 121 overall): The Michigan grad did not practice while dealing with a hamstring injury described as minor. Barner said he hopes to be back soon -- Seattle begins OTAs on May 20. Once healthy, Barner will compete with holdovers Brady Russell and Tyler Mabry and undrafted rookie free agent Jack Westover of Washington for what will be at least one, and maybe two, spots on the 53-man roster at tight end behind veterans Noah Fant and Pharaoh Brown.\n\nCornerback Nehemiah Pritchett (fifth round, 136 overall): Pritchett played mostly right cornerback during minicamp but figures to get snaps inside and maybe on the left side eventually, as well. Still, being on the right side makes sense because Devon Witherspoon and Tre Brown appear locked in to the starting spots on the left side (Witherspoon in the base and Brown when Witherspoon moves inside in the nickel and dime).\n\nBut the Seahawks could be looking for more competition on the right side behind Riq Woolen, where veteran Michael Jackson is the current backup.\n\nPritchett says wherever is fine with him.\n\n\"I think I'm a really smart corner,'' Pritchett said last week when asked to describe his style. \"A really long, fast corner that can play in any type of scheme. I think I'm really good at press (coverage). I'm versatile. I can play inside and outside. I think that's the best way I can describe it.\"\n\nGuard Sataoa Laumea (sixth round, 179 overall): While Laumea played tackle the last two years at Utah, the Seahawks drafted him with the intent to move him inside. And that's where Laumea played during camp, usually at left guard.\n\nLaumea says that's where he prefers to play for now.\n\n\"I'm willing to learn so if they want me outside, I definitely trust (offensive line) coach (Scott) Huff to coach me up to play tackle if he needs me,'' he said. \"In my career I have definitely been more comfortable on the inside. I feel like at the Senior Bowl I moved back inside after two years of not playing (there) because I do feel comfortable. But, I am willing to learn to play wherever they need me.\"\n\nCornerback D.J. James (sixth round, 192 overall): James played mostly in the slot during minicamp but saw a few snaps outside. Macdonald says the goal is for him to be able to play both, though nickel figures to be his primary position, where he may compete with Coby Bryant and Artie Burns for a backup spot behind Witherspoon.\n\nJames played only 84 of 690 snaps last season at Auburn inside but he says he feels comfortable there.\n\n\"It's going really well playing inside nickel and playing outside corner,'' he said Saturday. \"Just adjusting to playing more inside as well. But it's going really good. I'm learning.\"\n\nOffensive lineman Michael Jerrell (sixth round, 207 overall): Jerrell, from Division-II University of Findlay, played mostly right tackle -- where he is expected to begin his Seahawks career -- but saw a few snaps on Saturday at right guard as well.\n\n\"It felt good playing at guard,'' he said after Saturday's practice. \"Everything happens so fast. I feel like it's the same thing as playing tackle, it's just that everything is right there in front of you, obviously going up against a bigger guy. I think my speed and length at guard helps me a little bit. I didn't really have too much trouble, just getting adjusted to it.\"", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Zack Gelof hit his first home run in nearly three weeks and the Oakland Athletics beat the Kansas City Royals 7-5 on Tuesday night to end a nine-game losing streak.\n\nJJ Bleday had a career-high three doubles and drove in two runs, and Miguel Andujar added two hits to help Oakland to its first win since June 7.\n\n\"Getting a win in this league is tough, as we've seen the past few weeks,\" Gelof said. \"To get a win at home in front of the home crowd is awesome. I've been working with the coaches and teammates, and it looked like I was having quality at-bats today.\"\n\nThe last-place A's (27-48) have the fourth-worst record in the majors.\n\nA moment of silence was held before the game to honor Willie Mays, the Hall of Fame center fielder who died earlier in the day. Mays got the final hit of his illustrious career at the Oakland Coliseum in the 1973 World Series.\n\n\"I just wish I was half the player that he was,\" said A's manager Mark Kotsay, who played center field for much of his career. \"The catches that he made and just the smile that he had, the impact he had on the game of baseball. His loss is felt today and will be felt for a long time.\"\n\nNick Loftin hit his first career home run and had three RBIs for the Royals, who have lost three of four.\n\nGelof, who entered in a 5-for-30 funk, singled and scored in the first inning and then hit a three-run homer off starter Alec Marsh (5-4) in the fourth.\n\n\"I've been struggling a little bit but it makes it all worth it to come through when it matters,\" Gelof said. \"Felt great and hopefully some more to come.\"\n\nHogan Harris (1-0) pitched five uneven innings to get the win, his first since the end of 2023 when he also beat the Royals. Harris, who left with the lead but got no decision in each of his three previous starts, allowed three runs (one earned) and four hits.\n\nKansas City, which left the bases loaded in the fourth, scored twice off Lucas Erceg in the eighth and got the potential tying run to the plate before Scott Alexander got Adam Frazier to fly out. Mason Miller retired three batters in the ninth for his 13th save, fourth-most by a rookie in franchise history.\n\nComing off an 0-7 road trip, the A's got going early in their return home.\n\nLeadoff hitter Max Schuemann walked in the first and scored on Bleday's double off the wall. After Bleday advanced to third on a flyout, Brent Rooker hit a sacrifice fly to make it 2-0.\n\n\"We definitely were in need of a good baseball game and a win,\" Kotsay said. \"We swung the bats better on the road and continued to swing the bats good tonight. All in all, a good feeling to come from where we were and to bounce back tonight.\"\n\nKansas City tied it with a pair of unearned runs in the second. Freddy Fermin reached on Schuemann's fielding error at shortstop and came around when Loftin snapped an 0-for-14 slide with a homer on the next pitch.\n\nMarsh, coming off a superb outing against the New York Yankees, was tagged for a career-high seven runs and seven hits in three innings.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRoyals: RHP Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez was recalled from Triple-A Omaha. OF Drew Waters was optioned down.\n\nAthletics: INF J.D. Davis, who missed time this season with a right adductor strain, was designated for assignment. OF Seth Brown was sent outright to Triple-A Las Vegas. OF Lawrence Butler and 3B Tyler Nevin were called up from Las Vegas.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRoyals LHP Cole Ragans (4-4, 3.14 ERA), who pitched seven scoreless innings against Oakland on May 17, starts the middle game of the series Wednesday. RHP Luis Medina (0-2, 5.87), who has lost five consecutive decisions dating to last July, goes for the A's.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType":

(AP) -- Zack Gelof hit his first home run in nearly three weeks and the Oakland Athletics beat the Kansas City Royals 7-5 on Tuesday night to end a nine-game losing streak.\n\nJJ Bleday had a career-high three doubles and drove in two runs, and Miguel Andujar added two hits to help Oakland to its first win since June 7.\n\n\"Getting a win in this league is tough, as we've seen the past few weeks,\" Gelof said. \"To get a win at home in front of the home crowd is awesome. I've been working with the coaches and teammates, and it looked like I was having quality at-bats today.\"\n\nThe last-place A's (27-48) have the fourth-worst record in the majors.\n\nA moment of silence was held before the game to honor Willie Mays, the Hall of Fame center fielder who died earlier in the day. Mays got the final hit of his illustrious career at the Oakland Coliseum in the 1973 World Series.\n\n\"I just wish I was half the player that he was,\" said A's manager Mark Kotsay, who played center field for much of his career. \"The catches that he made and just the smile that he had, the impact he had on the game of baseball. His loss is felt today and will be felt for a long time.\"\n\nNick Loftin hit his first career home run and had three RBIs for the Royals, who have lost three of four.\n\nGelof, who entered in a 5-for-30 funk, singled and scored in the first inning and then hit a three-run homer off starter Alec Marsh (5-4) in the fourth.\n\n\"I've been struggling a little bit but it makes it all worth it to come through when it matters,\" Gelof said. \"Felt great and hopefully some more to come.\"\n\nHogan Harris (1-0) pitched five uneven innings to get the win, his first since the end of 2023 when he also beat the Royals. Harris, who left with the lead but got no decision in each of his three previous starts, allowed three runs (one earned) and four hits.\n\nKansas City, which left the bases loaded in the fourth, scored twice off Lucas Erceg in the eighth and got the potential tying run to the plate before Scott Alexander got Adam Frazier to fly out. Mason Miller retired three batters in the ninth for his 13th save, fourth-most by a rookie in franchise history.\n\nComing off an 0-7 road trip, the A's got going early in their return home.\n\nLeadoff hitter Max Schuemann walked in the first and scored on Bleday's double off the wall. After Bleday advanced to third on a flyout, Brent Rooker hit a sacrifice fly to make it 2-0.\n\n\"We definitely were in need of a good baseball game and a win,\" Kotsay said. \"We swung the bats better on the road and continued to swing the bats good tonight. All in all, a good feeling to come from where we were and to bounce back tonight.\"\n\nKansas City tied it with a pair of unearned runs in the second. Freddy Fermin reached on Schuemann's fielding error at shortstop and came around when Loftin snapped an 0-for-14 slide with a homer on the next pitch.\n\nMarsh, coming off a superb outing against the New York Yankees, was tagged for a career-high seven runs and seven hits in three innings.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRoyals: RHP Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez was recalled from Triple-A Omaha. OF Drew Waters was optioned down.\n\nAthletics: INF J.D. Davis, who missed time this season with a right adductor strain, was designated for assignment. OF Seth Brown was sent outright to Triple-A Las Vegas. OF Lawrence Butler and 3B Tyler Nevin were called up from Las Vegas.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRoyals LHP Cole Ragans (4-4, 3.14 ERA), who pitched seven scoreless innings against Oakland on May 17, starts the middle game of the series Wednesday. RHP Luis Medina (0-2, 5.87), who has lost five consecutive decisions dating to last July, goes for the A's.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType":

(AP) -- Luis Medina held down Kansas City to get his first victory in more than 11 months and the Oakland Athletics won their second straight game following a nine-game skid, beating the Royals 5-1 on Wednesday night.\n\nMedina (1-2) had lost five straight decisions since beating Boston on July 18 last season but was sharp against the struggling Royals. He allowed one run on an RBI double by Bobby Witt Jr. and six hits in 5 2/3 innings for the win in front of an announced crowd of 4,557 fans.\n\nBrett Rooker hit a pair of RBI singles for Oakland and Zack Gelof hit a solo homer to provide the offense. Medina and the bullpen did the rest, giving the A's their first back-to-back wins since a six-game winning streak that ended May 4.\n\nA's relievers threw 3 1/3 scoreless innings, ending a streak of 13 straight games that the bullpen allowed at least one run.\n\nThe Royals have lost eight of their last 10 games, including back-to-back games against an A's team that has the second worst record in the American League .\n\nRagans pitched well, allowing only four hits in six innings but ran into trouble in the third inning when he walked Max Schuemann and JJ Bleday to open the frame. Miguel Andujar and Rooker followed with singles to make to give Oakland a 2-0 lead.\n\nAfter Witt's double got Kansas City on the board in the fifth, the A's got some insurance in the seventh inning with RBI singles to Rooker and Tyler Nevin against John Schreiber to make it 4-1.\n\nGelof added his seventh homer of the season in the eighth inning.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRoyals: RHP Dan Altavilla left in the eighth inning after grabbing his right side after throwing ball four to Schuemann.\n\nAthletics: INF Abraham Toro is dealing with shoulder soreness from a swing on Sunday and was held out of the lineup. Manager Mark Kotsay said he's hopeful Toro can avoid a stint on the IL.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP Seth Lugo (10-2, 2.40 ERA) looks for his Major League-leading 11th win when he starts the series finale for

(AP) -- Luis Medina held down Kansas City to get his first victory in more than 11 months and the Oakland Athletics won their second straight game following a nine-game skid, beating the Royals 5-1 on Wednesday night.\n\nMedina (1-2) had lost five straight decisions since beating Boston on July 18 last season but was sharp against the struggling Royals. He allowed one run on an RBI double by Bobby Witt Jr. and six hits in 5 2/3 innings for the win in front of an announced crowd of 4,557 fans.\n\n\"All the time when I go out there, I'm just trying to do a good job and help my teammates,\" Medina said. \"Every game we try to make an adjustment and try to be better every day. Every time I go out there, I'm trying to put my team in a good situation.\"\n\nBrett Rooker hit a pair of RBI singles, Miguel Andujar had three hits and an RBI and Zack Gelof hit a solo homer to provide the offense for Oakland. Medina and the bullpen did the rest, giving the A's their first back-to-back wins since a six-game winning streak that ended May 4.\n\nA's relievers threw 3 1/3 scoreless innings, ending a streak of 13 games that the bullpen allowed at least one run.\n\nThe Royals have lost eight of their last 10 games, including back-to-back games against an A's team that has the second worst record in the American League .\n\nRagans pitched well, allowing only four hits in six innings but ran into trouble in the third inning when he walked Max Schuemann and JJ Bleday to open the frame. Andujar and Rooker followed with singles to make to give Oakland a 2-0 lead.\n\n\"His stuff was good,\" manager Matt Quatraro said. \"Those walks came back to haunt him there in the third inning. They capitalized on those and that's all he gave up. His stuff was really good. He gave us six solid innings, two runs, and gave us a chance to win.\"\n\nAndujar has 10 multi-hit games since coming off the injured list May 24, providing a big boost after starting the year on the injured list recovering from knee surgery.\n\n\"He's just a hitter,\" manager Mark Kotsay said. \"You don't see these types of hitters that often in the current game that just have bat to ball skills, along with the ability to hit it with some force and exit velo. We talked about the impact he could have once we got him back. Ten multi-hit games is an impact to the offense and a real positive to the middle of the order.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nAfter Witt's double got Kansas City on the board in the fifth, the A's got some insurance in the seventh inning with RBI singles to Rooker and Tyler Nevin against John Schreiber to make it 4-1.\n\nGelof added his seventh homer of the season in the eighth inning.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRoyals: RHP Dan Altavilla left in the eighth inning after hurting his back after throwing ball four to Schuemann. There was no immediate word on the severity of the injury.\n\nAthletics: INF Abraham Toro is dealing with shoulder soreness from a swing on Sunday and was held out of the lineup. Kotsay said he's hopeful Toro can avoid a stint on the IL.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP Seth Lugo (10-2, 2.40 ERA) looks for his Major League-leading 11th win when he starts the series finale for Kansas City against RHP Mitch Spence (4-3, 3.95).\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Mays was ninety-three, and just two days shy of being honored at Rickwood Field in Alabama, where his incredible career began. The A's and Royals dedicated a moment of silence to the legend's memory.\n\nThe Oakland Athletics returned home for the start of a three-game series against the Kansas City Royals at the Oakland Coliseum. Oakland sent 27-year-old lefty Hogan Harris to the mound tonight against 26-year-old righty Alec Marsh for the Royals.\n\nMax Schuemann led off the bottom of the first with a walk and then came around to score on JJ Bleday's RBI double. A Miguel Andujar line out to right field moved Bleday to third and Brent Rooker's sac fly scored Bleday to make it 2-0 in favor of the A's.\n\nThe lead did not last long as a Schuemann error allowed Freddie Fermin to reach base. Nick Loftin then homered on the very next pitch to tie the score at 2. That was his first career knock.\n\nThe resilient A's bounced back in the bottom of the third. Zack Gelof singled to get the inning started. He stole second and moved to third on a Schuemann single. JJ Bleday doubled to drive in Gelof, his second RBI double of the evening. Andujar singled to score Schuemann and move Bleday to third. Rooker and Soderstrom struck out to end the inning, but not before the A's regained the lead 4-2.\n\nHarris pitched himself into and out of trouble in the top of the fourth. Tyler Nevin walked in his second at-bat back in the majors. Lawrence Butler doubled to the left field gap, moving Nevin to third. Gelof made Marsh pay with a rocket three-run-homer to left field. That shot gave the A's a 7-2 lead and sent Marsh to the showers.\n\nFormer A's hurler Sam Long replaced Marsh. Miguel Andujar singled, and Brent Rooker greeted his former teammate with a double off the left field wall.\n\nKyle Isbel tripled to right field and scored on a ground out to Gelof. That tightened the score to 7-3.\n\nVinnie Nittoli relieved Harris in the sixth. Harris left as the winning pitcher of record, giving up four hits, one earned run, two walks and three strike outs.\n\nJJ Bleday doubled for the third time tonight in the bottom of the sixth with one down. He was stranded there. Austin Adams came on to pitch the seventh for the A's. He shut the Royals down. Lucas Erceg entered the game in the eighth. He gave up singles to Vinnie Pasquantino and Salvy Perez. He walked pinch-hitter MJ Melendez to load the bases with no outs. Freddy Fermin and Nick Loftin both grounded out, but each ground out scored a run. Kotsay lifted Erceg for Scott Alexander with two outs in the eighth. Alexander got the final out on a deep fly to Bleday. Heading into the bottom of the eighth, the A's led 7-5.\n\nMason Miller entered the game to slam the door in the ninth. Miller was dominant, hitting 102+ mph on multiple pitches and making quick work of the Royals for his thirteenth save of the season.", "source": {"uri": "athleticsnation.com", "dataType": "news",

JJ Bleday also had an impressive performance, hitting a career-high three doubles and driving in two runs, while Miguel Andujar contributed with two hits. This win comes as a relief for the last-place A's, who currently hold the fourth-worst record in the majors at 27-48.\n\nBefore the game, a moment of silence was observed to pay tribute to the legendary Willie Mays, who passed away earlier in the day. Mays, a Hall of Fame center fielder, had his final hit in the 1973 World Series at the Oakland Coliseum. The significance of this tribute added an emotional touch to the game.\n\nDespite the loss, the Royals saw a standout performance from Nick Loftin, who hit his first career home run and drove in three RBIs. However, Gelof's offensive resurgence proved to be the turning point for the Athletics. Gelof, who had been struggling with a 5-for-30 slump, not only scored a run in the first inning but also delivered a crucial three-run homer in the fourth inning off Royals' starter Alec Marsh. Pitcher Hogan Harris played a vital role in securing the win, pitching five uneven innings and allowing only one earned run.

So began a six-game homestand before an announced Coliseum crowd of 7,013, which paused pregame for a moment of silence to honor the late Willie Mays.\n\nCloser Mason Miller came on in the ninth to notch his 13th save, fourth-most in Oakland history by a rookie.\n\nGelof's 393-foot shot came on a 2-0 slider with no outs, and it chased Royals' starter Alec Marsh, who took a no-hitter into the seventh in his previous start.\n\nAlso scoring on Gelof's sixth home run of the year were Tyler Nevin and Lawrence Butler, both of whom came up Tuesday from Triple-A Las Vegas to replace veterans Seth Brown (outrighted to Triple-A) and J.D. Davis (designated for assignment).\n\nThat roster shakeup wasn't too surprising in the aftermath of an 0-7 road trip, in which Brown and Davis continued their offensive struggles and reflected the A's overall woes.\n\nThe A's bats promptly came alive upon Tuesday night's homecoming. They took a 2-0 lead in the first on J.J. Bleday's RBI double and Brent Rooker's sacrifice fly. The Royals pulled even in the next inning on Nick Loftin's first career home run, to centerfield off A's starter Hogan Harris.\n\nAnother RBI double from Bleday put the A's back ahead in the third inning, and then Miguel Andujar drove in another run with an infield single that bounced off the gloves of the Royals' third baseman and shortstop. That two-run rally put the A's ahead 4-2. They had not scored more than five runs in any of their previous nine games/losses, and they reached that total only once, in a 10-inning loss Friday at Minnesota.\n\nIn the sixth, Bleday doubled for a third time Tuesday night, giving him 22 doubles this season that are third-most in the majors.\n\nHarris allowed three runs (one earned), four hits, and two walks in five innings, exiting once his 100th pitch was caught on the center-field warning track. In the previous inning, Harris worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the fourth to keep the A's ahead 4-3. That set the stage for Gelof's homer.\n\nA's reliever Austin Adams kept it a 7-3 lead in the seventh when he struck out the majors' leading hitter, Bobby Witt Jr. Left stranded at second base was Adam Frazier, who had greeted A's Adams with an opposite-field, leadoff double.\n\nReliever Lucas Erceg wasn't as efficient in the eighth, yielding back-to-back singles and a walk to load the bases. The Royals scratched across two runs on two groundouts, then Scott Alexander entered to induce a rally-ending flyout.\n\nMiller finished off the win by getting Witt to flyout, after starting that at-bat with a pair of 102-mph fastballs for strikes.\n\nThe A's nine-game losing streak included seven defeats from their just-completed road trip through San Diego and Minnesota, with three coming in walk-off fashion. Losing streaks have not been uncommon. In May, the A's lost eight straight. Last year, an 11-game skid ended three losses shy of their longest in Oakland history; the franchise record is 20 straight losses (1916, 1943).", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news",

But baseball fans in both regions share one thing in common: They loved, and then lost, the A's.\n\nThe A's got their start in Philadelphia in 1901 and next season are headed to Sacramento for what is expected to be a pit stop on the road to ultimately resettling in Las Vegas. But no matter where the A's go, the Oakland-Kansas City connection will always be unique.\n\nThe Royals, the team Kansas City got when the A's bolted from Missouri in 1968, make their final appearance in Oakland with a three-game series that begins Tuesday night.\n\nThe A's already made their annual visit to Kauffman Stadium, the ballpark that local officials were strong-armed into approving in the mid-1960s in a failed attempt to keep the franchise from moving to Oakland.\n\nIf any fan base understands what Oakland A's diehards are going through, it's in Kansas City.\n\n\"The older ones are dying off, but there are still people here that are bitter that the A's left Kansas City and wish they were still here,\" said Jeff Logan, president of the Kansas City Baseball Historical Society.\n\nThe A's run in Kansas City was just 13 seasons - compared to 57 in Oakland - but that's where the core of the Oakland teams that won three straight World Series titles in the 1970s got their start, including Catfish Hunter, Reggie Jackson, Rollie Fingers, Sal Bando, Joe Rudi and Campy Campaneris. Even Charlie-O the mule and Harvey The Rabbit made their major league debuts as Kansas City A's.\n\nFor former Kansas City A's fans such as Logan, what's going on in Oakland is a case of history repeating. Only the ownership group has changed.\n\n\"It's almost identical,\" Logan said. \"And it's all about greed.\"\n\nThe A's played in Kansas City from 1955 through 1967. The relationship likely would have lasted much longer if not for the arrival of a new ownership group that alienated the fan base as it brazenly looked for anywhere else to call home.\n\nOakland might never have called the A's its own if then-owner Arnold Johnson hadn't suffered a fatal stroke in March of 1960. Eight months later, Charlie O. Finley, after four previous failed attempts to buy a baseball team (including losing out to Johnson on the A's in 1954) became the majority owner.\n\nAlmost immediately, Finley announced that the team had to relocate.\n\nAmong his complaints: poor attendance and fan support, and an outdated stadium.\n\nThe A's ranked at the bottom of the league in attendance at the end of their run in Kansas City (similar to the current situation in Oakland), but Finley kept a low payroll and, largely as a result, the team was rarely competitive. In fact, the A's never had a winning record in 13 seasons in Missouri.\n\nIn a twist Oakland A's fans can relate to, Kansas City fans did show up when the team was worth following. In their debut season in Kansas City, they drew more than one million fans and ranked second in the AL in attendance, trailing only the New York Yankees.\n\nFinley constantly battled city officials and the American League and almost immediately set his sights on moving the team.\n\nHe investigated Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, San Diego, Milwaukee, Denver, Atlanta, New Orleans and Seattle. At one point he even floated the idea of building a temporary ballpark in a pasture in rural Missouri. Finley reached a deal to have the A's play at the Kentucky Fairgrounds in Louisville, but that also was blocked by the league.\n\nFinley's persistence - and the threat of lawsuits - finally convinced the league to grant Finley his wish. The A's final season in Kansas City was 1967.\n\nThe departure left fans and local leaders furious.\n\nMissouri legislator Stuart Symington called Oakland \"the luckiest city since Hiroshima\" to get Finley as an owner. (Finley had a colorful and contentious relationship with Oakland as well, threatening to move the franchise multiple times - two late-1970s deals to sell the team to Denver oilman Marvin Davis fell through - before he finally sold the team to the Haas family before the 1981 season).\n\nUnlike Oakland, however, Kansas City didn't have to wait long for another team. After threatening legal action, the Royals debuted in 1969, two years before their expansion team was supposed to arrive.\n\nTime will tell if Oakland gets its reboot from MLB.\n\n\"Tell the faithful of the A's that their glory will come in 5-7 years when it totally implodes and they are looking to move from Las Vegas,\" Logan said. \"Because that's what they do.\"\n\nKansas City might be looking for a new MLB team soon, too.\n\nRoyals ownership is threatening to relocate the franchise to Nashville, Tennessee, across the state border to Kansas, or somewhere else if it doesn't receive tax support for a proposal to replace 51-year-old Kauffman Stadium. Residents recently overwhelmingly opposed a sales tax measure that would have helped to fund a downtown ballpark.\n\nLogan says if the Royals leave the A's will always have a home in the Midwest.\n\n\"We would definitely welcome them back,\" Logan said with a laugh. \"We'll even give them a free stadium that's already built.\"", "source": {"uri": "eastbaytimes.com", "dataType":

Tonight, Luis Medina led the way with his best start and first win of the season.\n\nWith the 5-1 win, the A's have clinched a series victory for the first time since May 21-23 when they took / at home against the Colorado Rockies. The A's did a good job tonight of sprinkling some runs across throughout the entire game as well unlike their previous series against the Minnesota Twins.\n\nJust like last nights win, the A's got the games scoring started in the third with back-to-back RBI singles from Miguel Andujar and Brent Rooker.\n\nThe Royals cut the lead in half in the fifth thanks to a Bobby Witt Jr. RBI double but that was really their only threat of the night. The Royals would get their lead-off runner on base just one time besides the fifth including the fourth inning when Andujar hosed out Salvador Perez at second trying to stretch a lead-off single to a double.\n\nCredit Medina for keeping the Royals offense at bay through 5.2 innings of work. He allowed six hits in the effort but just one run while striking out three and walking two.\n\nThe A's added on two much insurance runs in the seventh with a runner on first. Three straight singles from Andujar, Rooker and Tyler Nevin grew the lead to 4-1 for the A's.\n\nIt was another day of being the A's offensive catalyst for Andujar who's now up to .330 on the season after a 3/5 effort tonight. He also has ten multi-hit games across 22 total. Credit Rooker as well -- he was / at the plate. The rest of the A's lineup combined for just three hits.\n\nIt wouldn't matter tonight, however, as the A's bullpen bridged the strong effort from Medina to finish the game strongly. Dany Jimenez worked the minimum in the seventh inning and Austin Adams followed it up by striking out a pair in a scoreless eighth to set up Mason Miller in the ninth.\n\nIt wouldn't be a save situation for Miller tonight though. Zack Gelof added a fifth run in the bottom of the eighth with a no-doubter to straightaway center.\n\nFor a minute it looked like it could be Scott Alexander in the bottom of the ninth with the non-save situation, but Mark Kotsay opted for Miller for the second consecutive night.

The homer for Loftin was his first in the majors.\n\nPerez had been questionable for Tuesday's game after having taken Saturday off and serving only as a designated hitter on Sunday. The Royals had Monday off.\n\nPerez hasn't caught since Friday and had gone only 1-for-11 in his previous three games. Royals manager Matt Quatraro played Perez at first base on Tuesday, finding a way to keep his .296 hitter in the lineup, and plans to mix in a stint there and at designated hitter going forward.\n\nThe Royals even made a roster move Tuesday with Perez's health in mind, opting to keep a third catcher (Austin Nola) on the roster and instead sent outfielder Drew Waters to Triple-A Omaha when promoting reliever Carlos Hernandez.\n\n\"We felt like it was important to continue to have Salvy get another day to see how he was going to be with his knee,\" Quatraro said of not employing his veteran behind the plate. \"He's back in there at first (base), but we needed coverage with Nola, so we opted to send Waters out. Not an easy decision, but something we felt was best for the whole team right now.\"\n\nFacing Quatraro's lineup on Wednesday will be A's right-hander Luis Medina (0-2, 5.87). He will be make his first career start against the Royals.\n\nMedina has gotten just three runs of support in his three starts this season, in which the A's have gone 0-3 while being outscored 16-3.\n\nThe Oakland offense pounded Royals starter Alec Marsh for seven runs in three innings in the series opener en route to their most runs in a victory since June 1. When the A's were swept in three straight games in Kansas City last month, they totaled just nine runs.\n\nMedina is scheduled to be matched up with Royals left-hander Cole Ragans (4-4, 3.14), who threw seven shutout innings, allowing two hits, in a 6-2 home triumph over the A's on May 17. The win improved his career record against Oakland to 2-1 with a 4.24 ERA in five games, including four starts.\n\nThe earlier outing against the A's began a six-game stretch in which Ragans has gone 2-1 with a 1.70 ERA, striking out 45 in 37 innings.\n\nThe Royals weren't the only ones making roster moves leading into Tuesday's game, with the A's pushing aside two veterans as they called up outfielder Lawrence Butler and infielder/outfielder Tyler Nevin from Triple-A Las Vegas. J.D. Davis was designated for assignment, while Seth Brown accepted a demotion to Triple-A.\n\nButler and Nevin contributed immediately to the big club, each chipping in a double to an 11-hit attack.\n\n\"J.D. wasn't swinging the bat the way he's capable,\" A's general manager David Forst said of Davis, who was hitting .236 with four homers and five RBIs in 39 games.\n\nAs for Brown, Forst said: \"He'll go down with the right mindset of earning his way back here. He worked really hard to get here, worked really hard to stay here. I don't have any doubt he'll put in the work there.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "islandpacket.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island Packet"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Both the A's and Royals entered this game having lost 8-of-10.\n\nOakland's offense looked bleak before finally getting to Royals' starter Seth Lugo in the seventh. That rally peaked onced Gelof barreled a 422-foot shot off the centerfield backdrop to tie the score at 2. Lugo had struck out Nos. 4 and 5 batters Brent Rooker and Tyler Soderstrom before Lawrence Butler then ripped a first-pitch double down the right-field line, and Gelof followed with his eighth home run this season.\n\nGelof got one more at-bat before this was over, only to get called out on strikes in the ninth, after Butler reached on an error to start a potential comeback. A's catcher Kyle McCann got thrown out for arguing from the dugout after Gelof's strikeout. Shea Langeliers, pinch-hitting for McCann, followed with a single, and Daz Cameron's sacrifice fly moved Butler to third base. Max Scherman flew out to end the A's bid for a third straight twin.\n\nThe Royals had reclaimed the lead when Witt led off the eighth and took a Vinny Nittoli cutter for a 422-foot ride into the left-field bleachers. Kansas City's previous two runs came on solo homers from Freddy Fermin off A's starter Mitch Spence, in the second and fourth innings. Fermin, the Royals' designated hitter, blasted Spence's well over the left-field wall (398 and 391 feet) for his second career multi-homer game. Spence had allowed just four home runs over 57 innings prior to this outing.\n\nSpence yielded just those two runs, six hits and one walk over six innings. His seventh and final strikeout came on pitch No. 98, and it stranded two runners; none of those strikeouts came on a pitch faster than 92.7 mph.\n\nThe A's tried to take the lead, only for Kyle McCann to get thrown out at home trying to score from first on pinch-hitter Abraham Toro's double into the right-field corner.\n\nLugo had pitched 6 2/3 scoreless innings before that home run wiped out any chance of him collecting a majors-leading 11th win this season.\n\nThe A's grounded into three double plays over the first four innings to remain scoreless,\n\nThe A's threatened to score in the sixth, but Lugo got Miguel Andjuar, the A's hottest hitter, to fly out and thus strand two runners. The A's again stranded two runners in the eighth, including Andujar at third.\n\nNOTES: The A's next host the Minnesota Twins, who swept their four-game series last weekend in Minneapolis. The series' projected starting pitchers: Friday, 6:40 p.m. -- the A's Joey Estes (2-2, 5.97 ERA) vs. the Royals' Chris Paddack (5-3, 5.25); Saturday, 1:07 p.m. -- JP Sears (4-6, 4.25) vs. Bailey Ober (6-4, 4.81); Sunday, 1:07 p.m. -- Hogan Harris (1-0, 2.37) vs. Pablo Lopez (6-6, 5.63). ... Fans displayed four banners from the right-field bleachers, those reading: \"SELL; SELL, FISHER; GENERATIONAL ROBBERY; NO FANS LIKE OAKLAND FANS.\" ...

I was waiting for that one.\"\n\nOne of the wins in his 9-1 start came when he struck out 10 in 5 2/3 innings in a 5-3 home triumph over the A's last month. He served up a home run to Seth Brown that day but won't see him in the rematch with the right fielder having been demoted to the minors on Tuesday.\n\nLugo has never lost to the A's, going 2-0 with a 5.68 ERA in three appearances, including two starts.\n\nHe will be facing an A's team that received huge production from the top of the lineup in the past two games, led by Andujar's 5-for-9 with two RBIs.\n\n\"You don't see these types of hitters that often in the current game ... those bat-to-ball skills as well as being able to hit with force,\" A's manager Mark Kotsay said of Andujar, whose hits in the series have all been singles. \"He's been a real positive to the middle of the order.\"\n\nAndujar was surrounded by productive teammates in the two wins. Max Schuemann has one hit, four walks and three runs out of the leadoff spot. JJ Bleday collected three doubles, three runs and two RBIs, and Brent Rooker drove in three runs with three hits.\n\nHoping for more of the same will be A's right-hander Mitch Spence (4-3, 3.95 ERA), who is winless in three June starts. He has allowed 10 runs and 23 hits in 18 2/3 innings during outings against the Seattle Mariners, Toronto Blue Jays and Minnesota.\n\nThe 26-year-old rookie also took a loss in a 6-2 setback at Kansas City on May 17 in his first matchup with the Royals.

Boys in blue beaten 5-1", "body": "The Kansas City Royals forced me to stay up later than I would prefer just to put on a lifeless display offensively en route to dropping a series to a trash Oakland A's team with a 5-1 loss tonight.\n\nCole Ragans did not have his best command early, frequently missing to both sides of the plate with non-competitive pitches. He worked around baserunners in the first two innings, but Oakland broke through in the third. Ragans walked Max Schuemann and JJ Bleday to start the inning, throwing only two pitches in the zone in the process. Miguel Andujar then slashed a letter-high outside fastball down the right field line to bring home Schuemann. Brent Rooker followed that up by lacing a pretty good changeup out to left to score Bleday. Ragans managed to recover, striking out Tyler Nevin and then rolling up a double play to end the inning, but Oakland led 2-0.\n\nThe Royals, meanwhile, had plenty of baserunners but couldn't make anything of them. Bobby Witt Jr. hit an infield single in the first and was stranded there. Nick Loftin doubled with one out in the second and advanced no further. Kyle Isbel knocked a leadoff single in the third before the next three hitters went down in order. The fourth was particularly painful. Salvador Perez looked like he had a leadoff double when he rocked a ball off the left field wall, but he was gunned down at second by Andujar. MJ Melendez then reached on a single, watched as Loftin struck out on a breaking ball several feet in front of the plate, then walked back to the dugout after Adam Frazier grounded out to end the inning. Five hits through the first four innings led to zero runs for Kansas City.\n\nThey finally managed to score in the fifth. Nelson Vel\u00e1zquez led off the inning with a walk. It looked like he would once again be stuck there after Isbel lined out and Maikel Garcia took a meatball of a breaker for strike three. But Witt came through by yanking a slider down the line to trade places with Vel\u00e1zquez, who had reached second on a wild pitch. Ragans followed that up with his first 1-2-3 inning of the night, aided by slick play at third by Garcia for the second out.\n\nBy the seventh, the game had become a battle of the bullpens, which is not the type of battle that Kansas City is equipped for. True to form, John Schrieber entered the game and surrendered two walks and three knocks, pushing Oakland's lead to 4-1. He was pulled after his second walk loaded the bases with two outs. Dan Altavilla managed to prevent further damage.\n\nThe Royals had a shot at a rally in the eighth when Pasquantino roped a double to right with one out. But Perez was absolutely helpless against Austin Adams's slider in a four pitch strikeout and Melendez went down looking on a slightly generous called strike away. In case the lead wasn't big enough yet for Oakland, Zack Gelof hit a nuke to straightaway center in the ninth to make it 5-1. Altavilla walked the next batter and he appeared to tweak something on his follow through. He was promptly pulled and replaced by Chris Stratton. He got out of the inning, but it should come as no surprise to anybody that the Royals were unable to score against Mason Miller in the ninth as he secured the 5-1 win for Oakland.\n\nThe loss drops Kansas City to 41-34, knocking them a half game behind Minnesota in the AL Central standings. This is the team's third straight series loss. The A's hadn't won consecutive games or a series since early May. The Royals will look to salvage the third game of the set tomorrow afternoon in Oakland.", "source": {"uri": "royalsreview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Royals Review"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Yesterday, Atlanta also selected the contract of Grant Holmes, a 2014 first round pick of the Dodgers who went the A's way in the Josh Reddick trade.\n\nBut who needs Grant Holmes when you have near-name doppelg\u00e4nger Grant Holman and his 0.00 ERA stashed in Triple-A? Call this guy up for a cup o' Joe already!\n\nSnoop calling games at Howard Terminal would be a nice alternate future.", "source": {"uri": "athleticsnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Athletics Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Gloom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "June Gloom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goth_subculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goth subculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grant Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelg\u00e4nger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doppelg\u00e4nger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Reddick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Reddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a8s4gZlBHBzIAA3Br6-sOo7mD1o=/0x250:3000x1750/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25494168/2157343219.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663781", "eventUri": "eng-9663781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

While the starting pitching injuries have piled up so too have the losses. The club had lost nine in a row before returning to the Coliseum, their longest losing streak of 2024 and a streak that sent them to the cellar of the AL West. After a solid start to the season, the A's were looking more like how many expected them to.\n\nThankfully that losing streak didn't hit double digits. Oakland got back in the win column on the first game of the homestand, defeating the Kansas City Royals by a 7-5 final in the first game and snapping that disastrous nine-game losing streak. That contest saw the offense finally break out of their mini funk with 13 total baserunners, including three JJ Bleday doubles. Is Bleday turning into the new Jed Lowrie with all of these doubles?\n\nThen last night saw the Athletics win their second straight game, something we haven't been able to write down recently. This time it was a much more well-rounded with as the club defeated the Royals 5-1 to make it two straight. While Bleday didn't collect a hit tonight he still scored two runs thanks to timely hits from his teammates. Add in a homer from Zack Gelof (for the second straight night), a quality outing from righty Luis Medina and a lockdown performance from the bullpen and you got yourselves a two-game winning streak and a series win. All-Star Brent Rooker spoke a bit after last night's win about this team:\n\nThe club needs to get greedy now. Kansas City came into town in the playoff hunt and many expected them to win the series, perhaps even sweep the A's. Now the shoe is on the other foot and the club has a chance to get a sweep and play early spoiler for a Royals team that is still determining its course of action for the trade deadline. The team hasn't had a sweep since late April when they swept the Pittsburgh Pirates so it's been a while. Getting swept at the hands of the Athletics wouldn't be a great development for them but would be fun for us. We haven't had a good fun sweep at the Coliseum in a while. Let's root for fun, right?\n\nHave a wonderful Thursday everyone!\n\nWe should be getting an update at some point today:\n\nEasily the best hitter for the A's right now:\n\nPlease don't trade Rooker.

Tonight the two teams will go at it again with the same 6:40 PM PDT first-pitch as the A's try to make it two in a row and take a series win.\n\nFor the A's, it would be there first series win in nearly a month when they took / against the Colorado Rockies at home at May 23. Luis Medina gets the starting nod for the A's looking to pick up his first win of the season in his fourth start.

Desperate for a win to avoid being swept by the lowly Athletics, the Royals rode three solo shots and held on by the skin of their teeth for a 3-2 win. Bobby Witt Jr's 8th inning homer proved to be the difference.\n\nKansas City improves to 42-34 while the Athletics fall to 28-49.\n\nIt was a big day for Freddy Fermin, who did most of the Royals' scoring. Fermin took Mitch Spence deep in the 2nd on a moonshot to give the Royals a 1-0 lead.\n\nHe took him deep again two innings later on a 3-2 slider to double that lead to 2-0. It was Fermin's second career two-homer game.\n\nUnfortunately, Kansas City fell victim to some bad sequencing. The first Fermin homer was followed by an MJ Melendez double and Dairon Blanco single, but neither scored. The second homer was again followed by a Melendez double, but the Royals stranded him once again.\n\nFermin singled again in the 6th, followed by a Melendez walk, but Darion Blanco struck out after checking his swing to end the inning on a pitch that appeared out of the zone. It was officially a backward strikeout, but it looked like the umpire told Blanco that he had him on the swing.\n\nThe Royals managed seven base runners against Spence in his 6.0 innings of work, and six of them were Fermin and Melendez. Spence struck out seven Royals before being removed in the 7th.\n\nMeanwhile, Seth Lugo put together another nice start for Kansas City. Lugo struck out just two Athletics in his first four innings of work before striking out four of the next five A's. A two-out single and walk brought the go-ahead run to the plate in the 6th, but Lugo got Miguel Andujar to fly out and escape the jam.\n\nLugo struck out two more Athletics to start the 7th, upping his total to eight and having just reached 90 pitches. He had struck out six of the last 10 A's at this point, before the wheels fell off a bit. Lawrence Butler roped a two-out double down the right field line before Zack Gelof took 1-1 slider on the outer half over the wall in center field to tie the game at 2-2. It was Gelof's third homer of the series.\n\nLugo walked Kyle McCann to put the go-ahead run on base, at which Matt Quatraro had seen enough. James McArthur replaced him and immediately gave up a double down the right field line on a slurve well out of the zone, a double that didn't hurt Kansas City thanks to McCann being thrown out at the plate.\n\nDespite the rough finish, Lugo still had a strong start, giving the Royals 6.2 innings of work and giving up just two runs. And luckily for Lugo, he plays on the same team as Bobby Witt Jr, who sent Vinny Nittoli's 3-2 sweeper 422 feet over the left field fence, giving Kansas City the lead once again.\n\nThe Royals bullpen wasn't content to make it easy, though. McArthur walked Max Schuemann to start the inning, only to pick him off a few pitches later. That pickoff ultimately saved a run. With two outs, McArthur issued a walk and a single, putting runners on the corners with two outs.\n\nQuatraro brought Angel Zerpa in to shut the door and he did, getting Tyler Nevin to ground into a fielder's choice. Witt Jr made it a bit tougher in the 9th than it had to be, allowing Butler to reach on an error to lead off the inning. Worse, the error brought Gelof to the plate representing the winning run.\n\nZerpa threw a perfect 1-2 slider to get Gelof looking. Gelof protested the call, along with the Athletics dugout, but the pitch was in the zone. McCann ended up getting ejected by home plate umpire D.J. Reyburn for arguing the call.\n\nShea Langeliers followed with a broken-bat single into right to put the tying run in scoring position. Oakland brought in Daz Cameron to pinch hit for Abraham Toro, which Quatraro responded to by bringing in Chris Stratton for the save.\n\nCameron flew out to right, moving Butler to third with two outs, but Stratton got Schuemann to fly out to center and end the game and avoid the sweep. Let's get the heck out of Oakland.\n\nUp Next: Royals at Rangers, Friday, June 21, 7:05 PM CDT, Globe Life Field. RHP Brady Singer (4-4, 3.39 ERA) v.

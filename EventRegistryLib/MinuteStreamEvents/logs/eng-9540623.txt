"Official media in Lebanon said an Israeli strike Sunday on a southern village killed four family members, with Hezbollah announcing retaliatory attacks, in the latest cross-border violence since the Gaza war erupted.Israel and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group have exchanged regular cross-border fire since Palestinian militant group Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel sparked war in the Gaza Strip.Fighting has intensified in recent weeks, with Hamas ally Hezbollah stepping up its attacks on northern Israel, and the Israeli military striking deeper into Lebanese territory.Lebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) said Sunday's strike in Mais al-Jabal killed \"four people from a single family\", reporting that the raid was carried out by Israeli aircraft.It identified the dead as a man, a woman and their children aged 12 and 21, and said two other people were wounded.A Lebanese security source, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media, confirmed the strike killed \"four civilians\".Mais al-Jabal municipality chief&nbsp;Abdelmoneim Shukair had earlier told AFP that three people were killed, saying they were a couple and their son.The Israeli military said in a statement later Sunday that \"this morning... fighter jets struck a military site in the area of Mais al-Jabal\", without providing further details.- More retaliatory fire -Hezbollah in a statement said it fired \"dozens of Katyusha and Falaq rockets\" at Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel \"in response to the horrific crime that the Israeli enemy committed in Mais al-Jabal\".It later said it fired dozens more Katyusha rockets across the border \"as part of the response\" to the Mais al-Jabal strike, and claimed a string of other attacks on northern Israel, some in stated retaliation to the raid.The Israeli army said in the statement that \"approximately 40 launches were identified crossing from Lebanon... a number of which were intercepted.\"\"No injuries were reported,\" it said, adding the army \"struck the sources of the fire\".It also said \"fighter jets struck Hezbollah military structures and terrorist infrastructure\" in several areas of southern Lebanon.Lebanon's NNA reported Israeli strikes on various locations in the country's south.Hezbollah has repeatedly declared that only a ceasefire in Gaza will end its attacks on Israel, which it says are in support of Gazans and Hamas.Both the United States and France have made diplomatic efforts to calm tensions on the Lebanese-Israeli border.In Lebanon, at least 390 people have been killed in nearly seven months of cross-border violence, mostly militants but also more than 70 civilians, according to an AFP tally.Israel says 11 soldiers and nine civilians have been killed on its side of the border.Tens of thousands of people have been displaced on both sides.burs-lg/srm", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Israel considers the Iran-backed Shiite militant group its most serious immediate threat, estimating that Hezbollah has around 150,000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel.\n\nWestern diplomats have made a series of so-far unsuccessful attempts to broker a de-escalation in the border region. Hezbollah has maintained that it would stop launching rockets towards northern Israel when there a cease-fire to end the monthslong war in Gaza. Israel has warned that it could launch a war against Hezbollah across its northern border should the fighting continue. The Israeli military also reported it targeted what it said was Hezbollah military infrastructure in other parts of southern Lebanon. Israeli strikes have killed more than 350 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters with Hezbollah and allied groups but also including more than 50 civilians. In Israel, strikes from Lebanon have killed at least 10 civilians and 12 soldiers.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_05_37_3344557.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540623", "eventUri": "eng-9540623", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-08", "textStart": 363, "textEnd": 372, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.584313725490196, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

In the afternoon, Hezbollah claimed to have retaliated several times to this strike, targeting towns in northern Israel.\n\nSince the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, Hezbollah has exchanged fire with the Israeli army on the Lebanese-Israeli border on an almost daily basis.\n\nAccording to Abdelmoneim Choucair, president of the Mais al-Jabal municipality, the four civilians killed were in a local convenience store. They were a father, Fadi Hnayki, his wife Maya Ammar, and their two children, Mohammad, aged 21, and Ahmad, aged 12.

The Israeli army told AFP it had spotted around 40 rockets fired from Lebanon, \"some of which have been intercepted.\" \"For the time being, no casualties have been reported,\" it said, adding that it had responded to the \"sources of the fire.\" Reuters photos show cars on fire or damaged in Kiryat Shmona, as well as firefighters putting out blazes reported after Hezbollah rocket fire.\n\nAn Israeli soldier watches a car burn in Kiryat Shmona, northern Israel, after Hezbollah rocket fire, May 5, 2024.

The four were killed in Meiss al Jabal, which has suffered extensive damage in regular exchanges of fire between Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group since the start of the war in Gaza last October.\n\nIn a statement, Hezbollah said it fired \"tens\" of Katyusha rockets at the Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, a northern town close to the Lebanese border, in retaliation. Airstrikes and shelling have taken place sporadically but both sides have pulled back from all-out war.\n\nMore than 250 Hezbollah members and 75 civilians have been killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon since October, security sources there say. In Israel, missile fire coming from Lebanon has killed around a dozen troops and several civilians, Israeli sources say. Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip stunned Israel with a cross-border raid on Oct. 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and 252 hostages taken, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nMore than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed and more than 77,000 have been wounded in Israel's response, according to Gaza's health ministry.

Qatari, Egyptian and US mediators met a Hamas delegation in Cairo on Saturday in the latest bid to halt the devastating almost seven-month-old war that has triggered worldwide protests.\n\nA senior Hamas source close to the negotiations told AFP there would be \"a new round\" of talks on Sunday.\n\nNegotiators seeking to halt the devastating war have proposed an initial 40-day pause in the fighting and an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.\n\nHaniyeh said Hamas had approached the talks with \"seriousness and positivity\" but questioned \"the meaning of an agreement if a ceasefire is not its first result\".\n\nEarlier Netanyahu had rejected Hamas's demand to end the war.\n\nIsrael was \"not ready to accept a situation in which the Hamas battalions come out of their bunkers, take control of Gaza again, rebuild their military infrastructure, and return to threaten the citizens of Israel\", he said.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate an agreement between Israel and Hamas for months.\n\nThe Qatar-based leader of Hamas's political office said the United States had \"provided cover for this occupation, should be the one to stop it instead of supplying it with weapons of destruction and extermination\".\n\nHaniyeh added that Hamas \"remains eager to reach a comprehensive and interconnected agreement in stages, ending the aggression, ensuring withdrawal, and achieving a serious prisoner exchange deal\".\n\nA local official and state media in Lebanon said an Israeli strike on a southern village on Sunday killed several people from the same family, with Hezbollah announcing rocket fire in retaliation.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah groups have exchanged regular cross-border fire regularly.\n\nFighting has intensified in recent weeks, with Israel striking deeper into Lebanese territory, while Hezbollah has stepped up its missile and drone attacks on military positions in northern Israel.\n\nLebanon's state-run National News Agency said the strike in Mais al-Jabal killed \"four people from a single family\", updating an earlier reported toll of three dead in the raid it said was carried out by Israeli aircraft.\n\nIt identified them as a man, a woman and their children aged 12 and 21, and said two other people were wounded.\n\nA Lebanese security source, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media, confirmed the strike killed \"four civilians\".\n\nMais al-Jabal municipality chief Abdelmoneim Shukair had earlier told AFP that three people were killed, saying they were a couple and their son.\n\nHezbollah in a statement said it fired \"dozens of Katyusha and Falaq rockets\" at Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel \"in response to the horrific crime that the Israeli enemy committed in Mais al-Jabal\".\n\nThe Lebanese movement has repeatedly declared that only a ceasefire in Gaza will put an end to its attacks on Israel, which it says are in support of Gazans and its ally Hamas.\n\nBoth the United States and France have made diplomatic efforts to calm tensions on the Lebanese-Israeli border.\n\nIn Lebanon, at least 390 people have been killed in nearly seven months of cross-border violence, mostly militants but also more than 70 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsrael says 11 soldiers and nine civilians have been killed on its side of the border.\n\nTens of thousands of people have been displaced on both sides.", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A number of others were reported wounded.\n\nDetails are still emerging as to what exactly happened and why the house was struck. All indications are that those killed were civilians, and that it was a civilian home. Israel has, as usual, declined to comment.\n\nThis is not out of keeping with recent Israeli airstrikes in which houses, often referred to as \"Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure,\" are targeted and sometimes damaged, sometimes utterly destroyed. In recent months, over 1,000 homes across southern Lebanon have suffered such devastation.\n\nThis has forced some 100,000 Lebanese civilians who lived in the south to flee northward to escape the near constant attacks. With their homes gone or in shambles, it's not clear even if calm did return, what they would return to or when.\n\nHezbollah responded to the incident by firing an estimated 65 Katyusha and Falaq rockets at the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmoma. Israel reported no injuries and that some rockets were intercepted by Iron Dome.\n\nThough retaliatory strikes from Hezbollah are not unusual, this is one of the single largest barrages of rocket fire from the group yet. Such attacks almost always lead to retaliation from Israel and then more retaliation from Hezbollah.\n\nIt is this tit-for-tat retaliation and the increased escalation of recent weeks that have many international officials worried that it could soon lead to a full-scale invasion of southern Lebanon by Israel.\n\nWhile Israeli officials have in fact threatened invasion, French and US officials have been in talks to try to prevent such a conflict, and are offering a deal in which Hezbollah would be removed from the direct border area by approximately 10 kilometers.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katyusha rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guerrilla warfare"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540623", "eventUri": "eng-9540623", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The airstrikes targeted Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, including an observation post in Matmoura and a building in Khiam. IDF footage showed a building hit by an airstrike. Additionally, the IDF used artillery to shell areas to remove other threats along the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\nThe airstrikes followed clashes on May 4 between the IDF and Hezbollah, in which Hezbollah fired an anti-tank missile at the border community of Shtula in Israel. Throughout May 5, a number of sirens sounded along Israel's northern border due to Hezbollah's attacks. The IDF identified at least forty launches from Lebanon in the aftermath of Hezbollah targeting various areas of the border on May 5.

However, what Israel committed against this family is a terrible massacre.\"\n\nHezbollah responded to the incident by launching dozens of Katyusha and Falaq missiles at Israel. The group said the operation was \"in response to the crime committed by Israel in the Mays Al-Jabal village.\"\n\nThe Israeli Upper Galilee Regional Council announced that missiles hit buildings in Kiryat Shmona, while Israeli Army Radio reported that some of the rockets fell inside the city, causing a power outage.\n\nAn Israeli army spokesman reported that 65 rockets were launched from southern Lebanon toward Israeli settlements in the Upper Galilee region.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli airstrikes hit the villages of Al-Adissa and Kafr Kila, while artillery shelling hit the village of Aitaroun.\n\nMaronite Patriarch Bechara Al-Rahi in his Sunday sermon called for an end to the war in southern Lebanon, urging an end to the \"demolition of homes, the destruction of shops, the burning of the land and its crops, and the killing and displacement of innocent civilians and the destruction of their livelihood in an economic condition that has already impoverished them.\"\n\nMohammed Raad, leader of Hezbollah's parliamentary bloc, meanwhile, expressed his disapproval of the West's backing for Israel.\n\nHe said that Israel \"faces no international deterrent. On the contrary, some support it in committing crimes.\"\n\nHe accused those who support Israel of being \"hypocrites and liars who falsely claim to champion human rights, civilization, and progress in the West, (yet) they provide Israel with financial aid, weapons, smart bombs, and a continuous air bridge.\"\n\nRaad concluded: \"We are not afraid of Israel's insanity.

This followed an attack earlier in the day on Kiryat Shmona which involved the use of 20 rockets. Hezbollah, the Iran-aligned militant group operating out of Lebanon, has claimed responsibility for both attacks, claiming that they were made in retaliation against an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon's Meiss El Jabal.\n\nThe attacks were reportedly carried out using a combination of Soviet-era Katyusha rockets and Iranian Falaq rockets. The Times of Israel said that no injuries were reported as a result of the second attack though a report from the Jerusalem Post did note that the rockets had ignited wildfires after some of them fell in open areas.\n\nAs for the earlier attack, the Jerusalem Post said that at least two people were injured as a result of the rockets, with the munitions reportedly striking several buildings throughout Kiryat Shmona.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have frequently exchanged fire since the start of the Gaza conflict following the events of October 7, with the latter often targeting towns and settlements in northern Israel which has led to mass evacuations in the past.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "digital_desk@republicworld.com", "name": "Digital Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Times of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katyusha rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Jerusalem Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiryat_Shmona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 29}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-11-169701802188616_9.bin", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540623", "eventUri": "eng-9540623", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1276, "textEnd": 1285}], "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Israel hasn't so far commented.\n\nHezbollah said it fired \"tens\" of rockets at Kiryat Shmona in response to Israel's attack, the militant group's Al-Manar TV reported.\n\nIsraeli forces have been exchanging cross-border fire with the Lebanon-based Hezbollah almost daily since the start of the campaign against Hamas in October. Tensions appear to have intensified with Iran-backed Hezbollah since Israel and Tehran began attacking each other directly last month.\n\nTens of thousands of Israelis and Lebanese have fled their homes near the borders due to ongoing cross-border fighting. That erupted around the time Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and triggering the war in Gaza that's destroyed much of the enclave and killed more than 34,000 Palestinians.\n\nHezbollah is thought to have more than 100,000 fighters, many of whom are situated close to the border with Israel. The group has a far larger and more sophisticated arsenal of missiles and other weapons than Hamas.

Anyone who thinks that the residents of Kiryat Shmona will return to the city to be sitting ducks is seriously mistaken.\"\n\n\"If there is no clear decision, the Kaplan Street protests will be child's play compared to what we are planning soon,\" warned Stern.\n\nAt least two people were wounded after Hezbollah fired a barrage of rockets toward Kiryat Shmona on Sunday, with several of the rockets hitting buildings and vehicles throughout the city.\n\nOrganizations representing residents of northern Israel issued a joint statement on Sunday, expressing concerns about a ceasefire agreement reportedly being discussed between Hezbollah and Israel.\n\n\"In recent days, reports have been coming in that a political arrangement is being formulated to end the activity on the northern front, without guaranteeing a real change in the security reality in the north,\" said the organizations, stressing that the reported outline violates both UN Security Resolution 1701 and of the government's resolution to evacuate residents of the north.\n\nThe organizations issued three demands: a change in the security situation and the removal of the threat on the border, an end to decisions being made over citizens' heads, and for all local leaders to unite and work to represent all the residents of the cities, local councils, and regional councils.\n\nMoshe Davidovitz, the head of the Mateh Asher Regional Council and chairman of the Line of Confrontation Forum, warned that \"there is a complete disregard for human life here.\"\n\n\"Some of the residents have already lost hope and will not return, the businesses have collapsed, and they are groaning under the burden of the debts that are accumulating,\" said Davidovitz.\n\n\"It is the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day in the State of Israel, and I am calling on the Israeli government to act with a determined and clear plan in the north!\" added the regional council head, warning of \"the loss of trust, the uncertainty, and the feeling of insecurity\" among the public.\n\nGabi Naaman, head of the Shlomi local council, added that \"whoever thought that an arrangement could be reached with Hezbollah is wrong and misleading. The IDF must take significant action and drive Hezbollah away.\"\n\n\"Talk to them in their language and keep them away from the fence. The sooner the better. It is necessary to do this as soon as possible because we want to start the next school year here.

small compared to what these human monsters want to do to us,\" added Naaman.\n\nFrance working to deescalate situation between Hezbollah and Israel\n\nIn recent days, Lebanese and Israeli media have reported that France has presented a proposal to Lebanon and Israel which would aim to lead to an end of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nPart of the proposed deal would include negotiations to settle disputes concerning several locations along the Lebanese-Israeli border, as well as a commitment by Hezbollah to withdraw a few kilometers away from the border, according to the reports.\n\nLast week, French Foreign Minister St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 visited Lebanon and Israel to discuss the efforts to deescalate the situation.\n\nOn Friday, the speaker of the Lebanese

be amended.\"\n\nBerri added that the proposal had been written in English instead of in French, \"which came as a surprise.\" A source from the Hezbollah and Amal movements told Asharq Al-Awsat that

The Zionist entity and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group have exchanged regular cross-border fire since Palestinian militant group Hamas' unprecedented Oct 7 attack on the Zionist entity.\n\nFighting has intensified in recent weeks, with Hamas ally Hezbollah stepping up its attacks on the Zionist entity north, and the Zionist military striking deeper into Lebanese territory. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) said Sunday's strike in Mais Al-Jabal killed \"four people from a single family\", reporting that the raid was carried out by Zionist aircraft. It identified the dead as a man, a woman and their children aged 12 and 21, and said two other people were wounded. A Lebanese security source, requesting anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media, confirmed the strike killed \"four civilians\".\n\nMais Al-Jabal municipality chief Abdelmoneim Shukair had earlier told AFP that three people were killed, saying they were a couple and their son. The Zionist military said in a statement later Sunday that \"this morning... fighter jets struck a military site in the area of Mais Al-Jabal\", without providing further details.\n\nHezbollah in a statement said it fired \"dozens of Katyusha and Falaq rockets\" at Kiryat Shmona in the Zionist entity \"in response to the horrific crime that the (Zionist) enemy committed in Mais Al-Jabal\". It later said it fired dozens more Katyusha rockets across the border \"as part of the response\" to the Mais Al-Jabal strike, and claimed a string of other attacks on the northern Zionist entity, some in stated retaliation to the raid.\n\nThe Zionist army said in the statement that \"approximately 40 launches were identified crossing from Lebanon... a number of which were intercepted.\" \"No injuries were reported,\" it said, adding the army \"struck the sources of the fire\". It also said \"fighter jets struck Hezbollah military structures and terrorist infrastructure\" in several areas of southern Lebanon. Lebanon's NNA reported Zionist strikes on various locations in the country's south.\n\nHezbollah has repeatedly declared that only a ceasefire in Gaza will end its attacks on the Zionist entity, which it says are in support of Gazans and Hamas. Both the United States and France have made diplomatic efforts to calm tensions on the Lebanese-Zionist border. In Lebanon, at least 390 people have been killed in nearly seven months of cross-border violence. - AFP", "source": {"uri": "kuwaittimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kuwait Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@kuwaittimes.com", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_entity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zionist entity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katyusha rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiryat_Shmona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2024/05/05/105409.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540623", "eventUri": "eng-9540623", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 380, "textEnd": 385}], "sentiment": -0.615686274509804, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Lebanon's Hezbollah group.\n\nBut the strikes increased after Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip began on October 7, when the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group launched an unprecedented attack against Israel.\n\nLebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group, a Hamas ally, has been fighting in Syria alongside the forces of President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war.\n\nIsrael captured much of the Golan Heights from Syria in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed it in a move not recognized by the international community.\n\nRead more:\n\nIsrael struck position in east

The attack targeted the Golan where sirens were heard in several areas in the central Golan. Hezbollah said it had targeted the \"Golan division headquarters\" in a statement to Al-Mayadeen.\n\nThe report on the attack said that \"the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon - Hezbollah announced that it had targeted, on Monday morning, the headquarters of the Golan Division (210th) at the Nafah base with dozens of 'Katyusha' rockets.\" This is part of a series of Hezbollah escalations in the last days. It also attacked Kiryat Shmona on May 5 with 20 rockets and carried out an additional attack in the north with around 40 projectiles on May 5.\n\nHezbollah always claims its attacks are in \"response\" to Israeli actions. In this case, Hezbollah blamed Israel for an \"attack that targeted the Bekaa region.\"\n\nThe Hezbollah escalation comes as Iran is likely watching the developments in Gaza amid Israeli calls for civilians to evacuate eastern Rafah. This means that Iranian-backed proxies and terror groups may increase their attacks.\n\nIran prodding proxies to attack\n\nIran has recently prodded groups in Iraq and Bahrain to carry out attacks. However, the claims of the attacks cannot be verified because they consist largely of the groups putting out claims without much evidence. For instance, the terrorist group in Bahrain may not even be operating from Bahrain.\n\nBahrain is a member of the Abraham Accords, along with the UAE. It is less likely that a group could operate there even with Iranian backing. Therefore it is worth considering that some of the reports in pro-Iran media relate to statements more than they relate to reality.\n\nOn the Hezbollah front, however, things are different.

The couple left behind their two young daughters in Beirut.\n\nBut the Israeli strike came before they could finish their plans.\n\nwo men on mopeds pass buildings destroyed by an Israeli strike in Mais al-Jabal, South Lebanon, May 5, 2024.

They didn't think that the conflict would stretch on for more than half a year.\n\n\"Months have passed, and seasons changed. I left with winter clothes and went back to my village to get my summer clothes as the days grew warmer. I never thought when I packed my small backpack months ago to leave allegedly temporarily to Beirut to stay with my grandma that I wouldn't be going back home anytime soon,\" Duniah Moallem, a high school teacher from Mais al-Jabal told L'Orient Today.\n\n'Their only fault was that they were unarmed civilians on their own land'\n\nMukhtar Hassan Kabalan, who lives near the victims house in Mais al-Jabal and is a relative of the slain mother, Maya Ammar, told L'Orient Today that the family had been hardworking and respected.\n\n\"Maya is from the village but her husband is not. Her husband Fadi had opened a supermarket in the town around a year and a half ago and was a good hardworking man, respected by locals. He was also a distributor for a soap and detergent company in the south,\" Kabalan said.\n\nDebris are scattered around buildings damaged by anf Israeli strike in the southern Lebanese border village of Mais al-Jabal on May 5.

They were unarmed, their only fault was that they were in their own land, but as the owners of the land we insist on remaining here and we insist that the only way with this enemy [Israel] is through the resistance,\" Kabalan added.\n\nHezbollah MP condemns attack\n\nMaya and her son Mohammad have been buried close to each other in Mais al-Jabal while Fadi and Ahmad have been buried together in Beirut's Bauchourieh area, according to Kabalan.\n\nHezbollah MP Ali Fayyad attended Maya and Mohammad's funeral on Monday in the southern village, stating there that \"the Israeli enemy knows well that the targets were civilians, and this is an undeniable, clear-cut crime...therefore the resistance has the right to respond to any crime against Lebanese civilians.\"\n\nHe said that Hezbollah and its allied fighters \"target military objectives [in Israel] while the [Israeli] enemy targets civilians, villages, homes, shops and populated areas.\"\n\nFollowing the killing of the family, Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets into northern Israel on Sunday as a response \"to the massacre targeting innocent civilians committed by Israel in Mais al-Jabal,\" the party said in a statement.\n\nFuneral ceremony for Maya Ammar and her son Mohammed on May 6, 2024 in Mais al-Jabal. (Courtesy of Muntasser Abdallah/L'Orient Today)\n\nSince Oct. 8, Hezbollah and Israel have been involved in almost daily cross border fire.\n\nThe fighting has killed 382 people in Lebanon since then, according to L'Orient Today's count. On the Israeli side, 11 soldiers and nine civilians were killed, according to an official report quoted by AFP.\n\nHowever, Hezbollah has repeatedly said that Israel is not announcing the accurate number of its killed.\n\nThis isn't the first incident where civilians who had fled the south and temporarily gone back to pick up their belongings or check on their estates have been killed by an Israeli strike.\n\nIn November three young girls, the eldest being 14, were killed when an Israeli strike targeted their vehicle on the road between Aitaroun and Ain Ibl while they were retrieving

from Syrian territory\" towards the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nIn response, Israeli forces targeted \"three

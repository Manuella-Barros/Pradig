If no candidate wins more than 50% of the votes, a run-off will be held on June 22.\n\nSince replacing his father at the helm of the oil-producing Central African country, Deby has remained close with former colonial power and longtime ally France.\n\nWhile other junta-ruled Sahel countries including Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger have told Paris and other Western powers to withdraw and turned to Moscow for support, Chad remains the last Sahel state with a substantial French military presence.\n\nThe U.S., however, announced a temporary withdrawal of at least some troops last month, saying it would continue with a review of security operations after the election.\n\nOPPOSITION CONCERNS\n\nMonday's vote pits Deby against his prime minister Succes Masra, previously a political opponent who fled into exile in 2022 but was allowed back a year later. Also running are former prime minister Albert Pahimi Padacke and seven other candidates.\n\nYaya Dillo, an opposition politician who had been expected to run against Deby despite coming from the same clan, was shot and killed in the capital N'Djamena on Feb. 28, the day the election date was announced.\n\nPadacke has accused Masra of collaborating with Deby. But Masra has attracted large crowds to his own rallies.\n\nSome opposition members and civil society groups have called for a boycott, citing concerns about possible vote-rigging.\n\nThat has raised fears of potential violence.\n\n\"This presidential election is of capital importance for the country because an entire people aspires for change,\" said Baniara Yoyana, a former minister and magistrate.\n\n\"The process must be conducted with transparency to avoid any risk of confrontation.\"\n\nOne Deby supporter, however, said he expected no problems.\n\n\"We want the election to go well and peacefully,\" said Abdelkhader Sougui, a 28-year-old student.\n\n\"My wish is to go out and vote the morning of May 6 to confirm our victory... in the first round.\"", "source": {"uri":

By Issouf SANOGO (AFP)\n\nCounting was underway Monday evening after Chadians voted in a presidential election to end three years of military rule that opponents of junta leader Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno have dismissed as a fix.\n\nSeveral polling stations remained opened late in the capital N'Djamena, but with most closed counting got underway, AFP journalists reported.\n\nAt a small polling centre in the capital's Chagou district, a vote assessor broke the seal on a ballot box and took out voting slips one by one, reading out aloud to observers.\n\nChagou is a stronghold of candidate and prime minister Succes Masra and without surprise his name was well ahead of rivals in the count there.\n\nThe vote will decide whether to extend three decades of Deby family rule, in a country crucial to the fight against jihadism across the Sahel desert region.\n\nChad is the first of four military regimes in the Sahel to hold an election after successive coups in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger since 2020.\n\nDeby's main rival is former opposition leader Masra, denounced as a stooge by critics in the absence of other serious challengers.\n\nBoth men have vowed a first-round win in polls that international rights groups have warned will be neither free nor fair.\n\nA 65-year-old man was shot dead after voting in the southern city of Moundou by an unknown attacker who did not have an electoral card and was barred from voting, electoral officials said.\n\n\"I've come here today to make my choice now, to take on a good president who can change the country now and even help young people to evolve,\" said Angeline Goltoua, an unemployed 24-year-old.\n\nEarly in the campaign, observers predicted a massive win for Deby, 40, whose main rival has been killed and others banned from standing.\n\nHowever, economist Masra, also aged 40, has ramped up considerable support on the stump in recent weeks and could force a second round.\n\nProclaimed by generals\n\nMasra urged supporters to vote \"in massive numbers\" and for \"massive change\" after casting his ballot.\n\nSurrounded by armed presidential guards, Deby declared his \"commitment\" to a \"return to the constitutional order\" after voting.\n\nHe was proclaimed transitional president by 15 generals in 2021 after his father, Idriss Deby Itno, was killed in a gun battle with rebels after 30 years in power.\n\nKnown as MIDI for his initials and as \"the Man in Dark Glasses\", Mahamat promised an 18-month transition to democracy but then extended it by two years.\n\nOpposition figures have since fled, been silenced or joined forces with Deby, while the junta has eliminated any attempts by civil society to campaign against it.\n\nOn October 20, 2022, the army and police opened fire on demonstrators protesting the transition extension, including members of Masra's party, The Transformers.\n\nAt least 300 young people died according to international NGOs, or, according to the regime, about 50.\n\nDeby's cousin and chief election rival Yaya Dillo Djerou was shot point-blank in the head in an army assault on February 28, according to his party.\n\nMasra was among the opponents driven out of the country but later returned and was named prime minister in January.\n\nEight other candidates are not expected to win many votes.\n\nNot 'free or democratic'\n\nThe International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) has warned the election appears \"neither credible, free nor democratic\".\n\nThe International Crisis Group (ICG) also noted \"a number of problems in the run-up to the balloting cast doubt on its credibility\".\n\nThese include measures allowing officials to publish only regional vote tallies rather than posting the results at individual polling stations -- making it impossible for observers to verify the count.\n\nICG also cited Chad's Constitutional Council excluding 10 rival candidates from the vote in Deby strongholds.\n\nAs for Masra, it said: \"A significant proportion of his constituency now considers him to have become a stooge of those in power.\"\n\nIf Masra wins the election, it could be the first peaceful handover of power in Chad, which underwent several coups even before Deby's father seized power in 1990.\n\nMore than 8.2 million people are registered to vote in the largely desert central African nation, ranked by the United Nations as the fourth least-developed country in the world.\n\nWith a third of the population aged between 10 and 24, many are voting for the first time.\n\nResults are expected on May 21 with a possible second round on June 22.", "source": {"uri": "modernghana.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Modern Ghana Media Communication Ltd."}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@modernghana.com", "name": "Agence

If no candidate wins more than 50% of the votes, a run-off will be held on June 22.\n\nSince replacing his father at the helm of the oil-producing Central African country, Deby has remained close with former colonial power and longtime ally France.\n\nWhile other junta-ruled Sahel countries including Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger have told Paris and other Western powers to withdraw and turned to Moscow for support, Chad remains the last Sahel state with a substantial French military presence.\n\nThe U.S., however, announced a temporary withdrawal of at least some troops last month, saying it would continue with a review of security operations after the election.\n\nOPPOSITION CONCERNS\n\nMonday's vote pits Deby against his prime minister Succes Masra, previously a political opponent who fled into exile in 2022 but was allowed back a year later. Also running are former prime minister Albert Pahimi Padacke and seven other candidates.\n\nYaya Dillo, an opposition politician who had been expected to run against Deby despite coming from the same clan, was shot and killed in the capital N'Djamena on Feb. 28, the day the election date was announced.\n\nPadacke has accused Masra of collaborating with Deby. But Masra has attracted large crowds to his own rallies.\n\nSome opposition members and civil society groups have called for a boycott, citing concerns about possible vote-rigging.\n\nThat has raised fears of potential violence.\n\n\"This presidential election is of capital importance for the country because an entire people aspires for change,\" said Baniara Yoyana, a former minister and magistrate.\n\n\"The process must be conducted with transparency to avoid any risk of confrontation.\"\n\nOne Deby supporter, however, said he expected no problems.\n\n\"We want the election to go well and peacefully,\" said Abdelkhader Sougui, a 28-year-old student.\n\n\"My wish is to go out and vote the morning of May 6 to confirm our victory... in the first round.\"\n\n(Reporting by Mahamat

We don't have electricity. We don't have good schools. We don't have enough to eat. It's pathetic.\"\n\nVoting stations across Chad's vast largely desert territory will open from 6:00 am (0500 GMT) to 5:00 pm (1600 GMT).\n\nResults are expected on May 21, with a possible second round on June 22.\n\nlnf-gir/rlp/jj/ach\n\nMore from this section\n\nStriking deals to end campus protests, some colleges invite discussion of their investments", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType":

Yaya Dillo, an opposition politician who had been expected to run against Deby despite coming from the same clan, was shot and killed in the capital N'Djamena on Feb. 28, the day the election date was announced.\n\nChadians lined up on Monday to vote three years after military leader Mahamat Idris Deby seized power, in the first presidential election in Africa's Sahel region since a wave of coups. Analysts say Deby, who took over the day rebels killed his long-ruling father Idriss Deby in April 2021, is most likely to win, although his chief opponent drew larger-than-expected crowds on the campaign trail.\n\nDeby, who voted early on Monday in the capital N'Djamena, has promised to bolster security, strengthen the rule of law and increase electricity production. \"Today I'm upholding a fourth commitment which was to complete the transition process launched in our country 3 years ago. It is now up to the people to vote massively to choose their president,\" Deby said in a post on Facebook after voting.\n\nSome 8.5 million people registered to vote. Provisional results are expected by May 21 and final results by June 5. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the votes, a run-off will be held on June 22.\n\nOne voter in N'Djamena, Ahaya Khalil, said she was supporting Deby because he had promised to create jobs. \"Today is voting day, and thank God we've come to vote for our president of the republic. May God preserve him and our country,\" she said. \"We hope he'll give our children jobs once he's elected.\"\n\nThe vote coincides with a temporary withdrawal of U.S. troops from Chad, an important Western ally in a region of West and Central Africa courted by Russia and wracked by jihadism. Since replacing his father at the helm of the oil-producing Central African country, Deby has remained close with former colonial power and longtime ally France.\n\nWhile other junta-ruled Sahel countries including Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger have told Paris and other Western powers to withdraw and turned to Moscow for support, Chad remains the last Sahel state with a substantial French military presence. The U.S., however, announced a temporary withdrawal of at least some troops last month following an order by Chad's air force chief that the U.S. halt activities at an air base.\n\nOPPOSITION CONCERNS The vote pits Deby against his prime minister Succes Masra, previously a political opponent who fled into exile in 2022 but was allowed back a year later. Also running are former prime minister Albert Pahimi Padacke and seven other candidates.\n\nYaya Dillo, an opposition politician who had been expected to run against Deby despite coming from the same clan, was shot and killed in the capital N'Djamena on Feb. 28, the day the election date was announced. Padacke has accused Masra of collaborating with Deby. But Masra has attracted large crowds to his own rallies.\n\nSome opposition members and civil society groups have called for a boycott, citing concerns about possible vote-rigging. That has raised fears of potential violence.\n\n\"This presidential election is of capital importance for the country because an entire people aspires for change,\" said Baniara Yoyana, a former minister and magistrate. \"The process must be conducted with transparency to avoid any risk of confrontation.\"\n\nSome observers did not get their accreditations before the vote and were not given any reason for the refusal, Citizens' Alliance for Elections (ACET), a platform that monitors the poll, said in a statement on Sunday. One Deby supporter, however, said he expected no problems.\n\n\"We want the election to go well and peacefully,\" said Abdelkhader Sougui, a 28-year-old student. \"My wish is to go out and vote the morning of May 6 to confirm our victory... in the first round.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

Transition - UrduPoint", "body": "Chadians vote for a president on Monday in an election purportedly aimed at ending military rule but dismissed by opponents of junta leader Mahamat Idriss Deby as a fix following violent repression\n\nN'Djamena, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th May, 2024) Chadians vote for a president on Monday in an election purportedly aimed at ending military rule but dismissed by opponents of junta leader Mahamat Idriss Deby as a fix following violent repression.\n\nVoters will choose whether to extend decades of Deby family rule in one of the world's poorest countries, a crucial territory in the fight against jihadism across the Sahel desert region.\n\nThey have the chance to opt instead for Deby's own prime minister, Succes Masra, denounced as a stooge by critics in the absence of any other serious challengers.\n\nGenerals named Deby transition leader in 2021 when his father, longtime president Idriss Deby Itno, was killed in a gun battle with rebels after 30 years in power.\n\nKnown by his initials as MIDI, and \"the Man in Dark Glasses\", Mahamat promised an 18-month transition to democracy, but later extended it by two years.\n\nOpposition figures have since fled, been silenced or joined forces with Deby, while the junta has eliminated any attempts by civil society to campaign against it.\n\nMasra was among the opponents driven out of the country but later returned and was named prime minister in January.\n\nThe eight other candidates, either little known or considered not hostile to the regime, are not expected to win many votes.\n\nThe International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) warned on Friday that the election appeared \"neither credible, free nor democratic\".\n\nIt noted \"increasing human rights violations\" in the country, including Dillo's killing.\n\nThe International Crisis Group (ICG) warned that \"a number of problems in the run-up to the balloting cast doubt on its credibility\".\n\nThese include measures that allow officials to publish only regional tallies of votes rather than posting the results at individual polling stations -- making it impossible for observers to verify the vote-count.\n\nICG also cited the decision by Chad's Constitutional Council to exclude 10 rival candidates from the vote in Deby strongholds.\n\nAs for Masra, it said: \"A significant proportion of his constituency now considers him to have become a stooge of those in power\" -- though some analysts have said Masra may be genuinely aiming to become president.\n\nIn a country where a third of the inhabitants are aged between 10 and 24, a new generation of voters will be casting ballots for the first time.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news",

Transformers.\n\nAt least 300 young people died according to international NGOs, or, according to the regime, about 50.\n\nDeby's cousin and chief election rival Yaya Dillo Djerou was shot point-blank

Chad, which underwent several coups even before Deby's father seized power in 1990.\n\nMore than 8.2 million people are registered to vote in the largely desert central African nation, ranked by the United Nations as the fourth least-developed country in the world.\n\nWith a third of the population aged between 10 and 24, many are voting for the first time.\n\nVoting is due to end at 5:00 pm (1600 GMT), with results expected on May 21 and a possible second round on June 22.\n\nlnf-gir/rlp-kjm/bp\n\nMore from this section\n\nStriking deals to end campus protests, some colleges invite

18-month transition to democracy but then extended it by two years.\n\nOpposition figures have since fled, been silenced or joined forces with Deby, while the junta has eliminated any attempts by civil society to campaign against it.\n\nOn October 20, 2022, the army and police opened fire on demonstrators protesting the transition extension, including members of Masra's party, The Transformers.\n\nAt least 300 young people died according to international NGOs, or, according to the regime, about 50.\n\nDeby's cousin and chief election rival Yaya Dillo Djerou was shot point-blank in the head in an army assault on February 28, according to his party.\n\nMasra was among the opponents driven out of the country but later returned and was named prime minister in January.\n\nEight other candidates are not expected to win many votes.\n\n- Not 'free or democratic' -\n\nThe International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) has warned that the election appears \"neither credible, free nor democratic\".\n\nIt noted \"increasing human rights violations\", including Dillo's killing.\n\nThe International Crisis Group (ICG) also warned that \"a number of problems in the run-up to the balloting cast doubt on its credibility\".\n\nThese include measures that allow officials to publish only regional tallies of votes rather than posting the results at individual polling stations -- making it impossible for observers to verify the vote count.\n\nICG also cited Chad's Constitutional Council excluding 10 rival candidates from the vote in Deby strongholds.\n\nAs for Masra, it said: \"A significant proportion of his constituency now considers him to have become a stooge of those in power.\"\n\nIf Masra wins the election, it could be the first peaceful handover of power in Chad, which underwent several coups even before Deby's father seized power in 1990.\n\nMore than 8.2 million people are registered to vote in the largely desert central African nation, ranked by the United Nations as the fourth least-developed country in the world.\n\nWith a third of the population aged between 10 and 24, many are voting for the first time.", "source": {"uri":

coup-hit region | Fox 11 Tri Cities Fox 41 Yakima", "body": "Counting was underway Monday evening after Chadians voted in a presidential election to end three years of military rule that opponents of junta leader Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno have dismissed as a fix.\n\nSeveral polling stations remained opened late in the capital N'Djamena, but with most closed counting got underway, AFP journalists reported.\n\nAt a small polling centre in the capital's Chagou district, a vote assessor broke the seal on a ballot box and took out voting slips one by one, reading out aloud to observers.\n\nChagou is a stronghold of candidate and prime minister Succes Masra and without surprise his name was well ahead of rivals in the count there.\n\nThe vote will decide whether to extend three decades of Deby family rule, in a country crucial to the fight against jihadism across the Sahel desert region.\n\nChad is the first of four military regimes in the Sahel to hold an election after successive coups in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger since 2020.\n\nDeby's main rival is former opposition leader Masra, denounced as a stooge by critics in the absence of other serious challengers.\n\nBoth men have vowed a first-round win in polls that international rights groups have warned will be neither free nor fair.\n\nA 65-year-old man was shot dead after voting in the southern city of Moundou by an unknown attacker who did not have an electoral card and was barred from voting, electoral officials said.\n\n\"I've come here today to make my choice now, to take on a good president who can change the country now and even help young people to evolve,\" said Angeline Goltoua, an unemployed 24-year-old.\n\nEarly in the campaign, observers predicted a massive win for Deby, 40, whose main rival has been killed and others banned from standing.\n\nHowever, economist Masra, also aged 40, has ramped up considerable support on the stump in recent weeks and could force a second round.\n\n- Proclaimed by generals -\n\nMasra urged supporters to vote \"in massive numbers\" and for \"massive change\" after casting his ballot.\n\nSurrounded by armed presidential guards, Deby declared his \"commitment\" to a \"return to the constitutional order\" after voting.\n\nHe was proclaimed transitional president by 15 generals in 2021 after his father, Idriss Deby Itno, was killed in a gun battle with rebels after 30 years in power.\n\nKnown as MIDI for his initials and as \"the Man in Dark Glasses\", Mahamat promised an 18-month transition to democracy but then extended it by two years.\n\nOpposition figures have since fled, been silenced or joined forces with Deby, while the junta has eliminated any attempts by civil society to campaign against it.\n\nOn October 20, 2022, the army and police opened fire on demonstrators protesting the transition extension, including members of Masra's party, The Transformers.\n\nAt least 300 young people died according to international NGOs, or, according to the regime, about 50.\n\nDeby's cousin and chief election rival Yaya Dillo Djerou was shot point-blank in the head in an army assault on February 28, according to his party.\n\nMasra was among the opponents driven out of the country but later returned and was named prime minister in January.\n\nEight other candidates are not expected to win many votes.\n\n- Not 'free or democratic' -\n\nThe International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) has warned the election appears \"neither credible, free nor democratic\".\n\nThe International Crisis Group (ICG) also noted \"a number of problems in the run-up to the balloting cast doubt on its credibility\".\n\nThese include measures allowing officials to publish only regional vote tallies rather than posting the results at individual polling stations -- making it impossible for observers to verify the count.\n\nICG also cited Chad's Constitutional Council excluding 10 rival candidates from the vote in Deby strongholds.\n\nAs for Masra, it said: \"A significant proportion of his constituency now considers him to have become a stooge of those in power.\"\n\nIf Masra wins the election, it could be the first peaceful handover of power in Chad, which underwent several coups even before Deby's father seized power in 1990.\n\nMore than 8.2 million people are registered to vote in the largely desert central African nation, ranked by the United Nations as the fourth least-developed country in the world.\n\nWith a third of the population aged between 10 and 24, many are voting for the first time.\n\nResults are expected on May 21 with a possible second round on June 22.\n\nlnf-gir/rlp-kjm/bp/rlp\n\nFOX41 Yakima\u00a9FOX11 TriCities\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox41yakima.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 11 41 Tri Cities

It is now up to the people to vote massively to choose their president,\" Deby said in a post on Facebook after voting.\n\nSome 8.5 million people registered to vote. Provisional results are expected by May 21 and final results by June 5.\n\nIf no candidate wins more than 50% of the votes, a run-off will be held on June 22.\n\nOne voter in N'Djamena, Ahaya Khalil, said she was supporting Deby because he had promised to create jobs.\n\n\"Today is voting day, and thank God we've come to vote for our president of the republic. May God preserve him and our country,\" she said. \"We hope he'll give our children jobs once he's elected.\"\n\nThe vote coincides with a temporary withdrawal of U.S. troops from Chad, an important Western ally in a region of West and Central Africa courted by Russia and wracked by jihadism.\n\nSince replacing his father at the helm of the oil-producing Central African country, Deby has remained close with former colonial power and longtime ally France.\n\nWhile other junta-ruled Sahel countries including Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger have told Paris and other Western powers to withdraw and turned to Moscow for support, Chad remains the last Sahel state with a substantial French military presence.\n\nThe vote pits Deby against his prime minister Succes Masra, previously a political opponent who fled into exile in 2022 but was allowed back a year later. Also running are former prime minister Albert Pahimi Padacke and seven other candidates.\n\nYaya Dillo, an opposition politician who had been expected to run against Deby despite coming from the same clan, was shot and killed in the capital N'Djamena on Feb. 28, the day the election date was announced.\n\nPadacke has accused Masra of collaborating with Deby. But Masra has attracted large crowds to his own rallies.\n\nSome opposition members and civil society groups have called for a boycott, citing concerns about possible vote-rigging.\n\nThat has raised fears of potential violence.\n\n\"This presidential election is of capital importance for the country because an entire people aspires for change,\" said Baniara Yoyana, a former minister and magistrate.\n\n\"The process must be conducted with transparency to avoid any risk of confrontation.\"\n\nSome observers did not get their accreditations before the vote and were not given any reason for the refusal, Citizens' Alliance for Elections (ACET), a platform that monitors the poll, said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nOne Deby supporter, however, said he expected no problems.\n\n\"We want the election to go well and peacefully,\" said Abdelkhader Sougui, a 28-year-old student.\n\n\"My wish is to go out and vote the morning of May 6 to confirm our victory... in the first round.\"\n\n(Reporting by Mahamat Ramadane; Writing by Portia Crowe; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne)", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors":

"title": "Vote count underway in junta-led Chad in a first for coup-hit region", "body": "More than 8.2 million people are registered to vote in the largely desert central African country\n\nCounting was underway Monday evening after Chadians voted in a presidential election to end three years of military rule that opponents of junta leader Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno have dismissed as a fix.\n\nSeveral polling stations remained opened late in the capital N'Djamena, but with most closed counting got underway, AFP journalists reported.\n\nAt a small polling centre in the capital's Chagou district, a vote assessor broke the seal on a ballot box and took out voting slips one by one, reading out aloud to observers.\n\nChagou is a stronghold of candidate and prime minister Succes Masra and without surprise his name was well ahead of rivals in the count there.\n\nThe vote will decide whether to extend three decades of Deby family rule, in a country crucial to the fight against jihadism across the Sahel desert region.\n\nChad is the first of four military regimes in the Sahel to hold an election after successive coups in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger since 2020.\n\nDeby's main rival is former opposition leader Masra, denounced as a stooge by critics in the absence of other serious challengers.\n\nBoth men have vowed a first-round win in polls that international rights groups have warned will be neither free nor fair.\n\nA 65-year-old man was shot dead after voting in the southern city of Moundou by an unknown attacker who did not have an electoral card and was barred from voting, electoral officials said.\n\n\"I've come here today to make my choice now, to take on a good president who can change the country now and even help young people to evolve,\" said Angeline Goltoua, an unemployed 24-year-old.\n\nEarly in the campaign, observers predicted a massive win for Deby, 40, whose main rival has been killed and others banned from standing.\n\nHowever, economist Masra, also aged 40, has ramped up considerable support on the stump in recent weeks and could force a second round.\n\n- Proclaimed by generals -\n\nMasra urged supporters to vote \"in massive numbers\" and for \"massive change\" after casting his ballot.\n\nSurrounded by armed presidential guards, Deby declared his \"commitment\" to a \"return to the constitutional order\" after voting.\n\nHe was proclaimed transitional president by 15 generals in 2021 after his father, Idriss Deby Itno, was killed in a gun battle with rebels after 30 years in power.\n\nKnown as MIDI for his initials and as \"the Man in Dark Glasses\", Mahamat promised an 18-month transition to democracy but then extended it by two years.\n\nOpposition figures have since fled, been silenced or joined forces with Deby, while the junta has eliminated any attempts by civil society to campaign against it.\n\nOn October 20, 2022, the army and police opened fire on demonstrators protesting the transition extension, including members of Masra's party, The Transformers.\n\nAt least 300 young people died according to international NGOs, or, according to the regime, about 50.\n\nDeby's cousin and chief election rival Yaya Dillo Djerou was shot point-blank in the head in an army assault on February 28, according to his party.\n\nMasra was among the opponents driven out of the country but later returned and was named prime minister in January.\n\nEight other candidates are not expected to win many votes.\n\n- Not 'free or democratic' -\n\nThe International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) has warned the election appears \"neither credible, free nor democratic\".\n\nThe International Crisis Group (ICG) also noted \"a number of problems in the run-up to the balloting cast doubt on its credibility\".\n\nThese include measures allowing officials to publish only regional vote tallies rather than posting the results at individual polling stations -- making it impossible for observers to verify the count.\n\nICG also cited Chad's Constitutional Council excluding 10 rival candidates from the vote in Deby strongholds.\n\nAs for Masra, it said: \"A significant proportion of his constituency now considers him to have become a stooge of those in power.\"\n\nIf Masra wins the election, it could be the first peaceful handover of power in Chad, which underwent several coups even before Deby's father seized power in 1990.\n\nMore than 8.2 million people are registered to vote in the largely desert central African nation, ranked by the United Nations as the fourth least-developed country in the world.\n\nWith a third of the population aged between 10 and 24, many are voting for the first time.\n\nResults are expected on May 21 with a possible second round on June 22.\n\nlnf-gir/rlp-kjm/bp/rlp\n\nMore from this section\n\nStriking deals to end campus protests, some colleges invite discussion of their investments A look at commencement ceremonies as US

The three other junta-led regimes drove out French anti-jihadist forces, cutting ties with Paris in favour of closer links to Russia.\n\nThe United States says it will temporarily withdraw some of its 100 troops from Chad, after agreeing to pull out of Niger.\n\nDeby's main rival is former opposition leader and now prime minister Succes Masra, denounced as a stooge by critics in the absence of other serious challengers.\n\nBoth men have vowed a first-round win in polls that international rights groups have warned will be neither free nor fair.\n\n\"All those who have shown they want massive change must go and vote in massive numbers, peacefully,\" Masra, dressed in a blue boubou, said after voting.\n\nWhile turnout seemed slow shortly after polls opened in the capital N'Djamena, it had picked up by mid-morning in the more than 20 polling stations visited by AFP journalists.\n\n\"I've come here today to make my choice now, to take on a good president who can change the country now and even help young people to evolve,\" said Angeline Goltoua, an unemployed 24-year-old.\n\nEarly in the campaign, observers predicted a massive win for Deby, 40, whose main rival has been killed and others banned from standing.\n\nHowever, economist Masra, also aged 40, has ramped up considerable support on the stump in recent weeks and could force a second round.\n\n- Proclaimed by generals -\n\nSurrounded by armed presidential guards, Deby declared his \"commitment\" to a \"return to the constitutional order\" after voting.\n\nHe was proclaimed transitional president by 15 generals in 2021 after his father, Idriss Deby Itno, was killed in a gun battle with rebels after 30 years in power.\n\nKnown as MIDI for his initials and as \"the Man in Dark Glasses\", Mahamat promised an 18-month transition to democracy but then extended it by two years.\n\nOpposition figures have since fled, been silenced or joined forces with Deby, while the junta has eliminated any attempts by civil society to campaign against it.\n\nOn October 20, 2022, the army and police opened fire on demonstrators protesting the transition extension, including members of Masra's party, The Transformers.\n\nAt least 300 young people died according to international NGOs, or, according to the regime, about 50.\n\nDeby's cousin and chief election rival Yaya Dillo Djerou was shot point-blank in the head in an army assault on February 28, according to his party.\n\nMasra was among the opponents driven out of the country but later returned and was named prime minister in January.\n\nEight other candidates are not expected to win many votes.\n\n- Not 'free or democratic' -\n\nThe International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) has warned that the election appears \"neither credible, free nor democratic\".\n\nIt noted \"increasing human rights violations\", including Dillo's killing.\n\nThe International Crisis Group (ICG) also warned that \"a number of problems in the run-up to the balloting cast doubt on its credibility\".\n\nThese include measures that allow officials to publish only regional tallies of votes rather than posting the results at individual polling stations -- making it impossible for observers to verify the vote count.\n\nICG also cited Chad's Constitutional Council excluding 10 rival candidates from the vote in Deby strongholds.\n\nAs for Masra, it said: \"A significant proportion of his constituency now considers him to have become a stooge of those in power.\"\n\nIf Masra wins the election, it could be the first peaceful handover of power in Chad, which underwent several coups even before Deby's father seized power in 1990.\n\nMore than 8.2 million people are registered to vote in the largely desert central African nation, ranked by the United Nations as the fourth least-developed country in the world.\n\nWith a third of the population aged between 10 and 24, many are voting for the first time.\n\nVoting is due to end at 5:00 pm (1600 GMT), with results expected on May 21 and a possible second round on June 22.\n\nlnf-gir/rlp-kjm/bp\n\nFOX41 Yakima\u00a9FOX11 TriCities\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox41yakima.com", "dataType":

"title": "Vote count underway in junta-led Chad in a first for coup-hit region", "body": "More than 8.2 million people are registered to vote in the largely desert central African country\n\nCounting was underway Monday evening after Chadians voted in a presidential election to end three years of military rule that opponents of junta leader Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno have dismissed as a fix.\n\nSeveral polling stations remained opened late in the capital N'Djamena, but with most closed counting got underway, AFP journalists reported.\n\nAt a small polling centre in the capital's Chagou district, a vote assessor broke the seal on a ballot box and took out voting slips one by one, reading out aloud to observers.\n\nChagou is a stronghold of candidate and prime minister Succes Masra and without surprise his name was well ahead of rivals in the count there.\n\nThe vote will decide whether to extend three decades of Deby family rule, in a country crucial to the fight against jihadism across the Sahel desert region.\n\nChad is the first of four military regimes in the Sahel to hold an election after successive coups in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger since 2020.\n\nDeby's main rival is former opposition leader Masra, denounced as a stooge by critics in the absence of other serious challengers.\n\nBoth men have vowed a first-round win in polls that international rights groups have warned will be neither free nor fair.\n\nA 65-year-old man was shot dead after voting in the southern city of Moundou by an unknown attacker who did not have an electoral card and was barred from voting, electoral officials said.\n\n\"I've come here today to make my choice now, to take on a good president who can change the country now and even help young people to evolve,\" said Angeline Goltoua, an unemployed 24-year-old.\n\nEarly in the campaign, observers predicted a massive win for Deby, 40, whose main rival has been killed and others banned from standing.\n\nHowever, economist Masra, also aged 40, has ramped up considerable support on the stump in recent weeks and could force a second round.\n\n- Proclaimed by generals -\n\nMasra urged supporters to vote \"in massive numbers\" and for \"massive change\" after casting his ballot.\n\nSurrounded by armed presidential guards, Deby declared his \"commitment\" to a \"return to the constitutional order\" after voting.\n\nHe was proclaimed transitional president by 15 generals in 2021 after his father, Idriss Deby Itno, was killed in a gun battle with rebels after 30 years in power.\n\nKnown as MIDI for his initials and as \"the Man in Dark Glasses\", Mahamat promised an 18-month transition to democracy but then extended it by two years.\n\nMore from this section Lewis Street Underpass demolition is underway Photo Gallery: Columbus Museum celebrates reopening to the public Japan: Wildfire Erupts In Nanyo, Yamagata 2\n\nOpposition figures have since fled, been silenced or joined forces with Deby, while the junta has eliminated any attempts by civil society to campaign against it.\n\nOn October 20, 2022, the army and police opened fire on demonstrators protesting the transition extension, including members of Masra's party, The Transformers.\n\nAt least 300 young people died according to international NGOs, or, according to the regime, about 50.\n\nDeby's cousin and chief election rival Yaya Dillo Djerou was shot point-blank in the head in an army assault on February 28, according to his party.\n\nMasra was among the opponents driven out of the country but later returned and was named prime minister in January.\n\nEight other candidates are not expected to win many votes.\n\n- Not 'free or democratic' -\n\nThe International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) has warned the election appears \"neither credible, free nor democratic\".\n\nThe International Crisis Group (ICG) also noted \"a number of problems in the run-up to the balloting cast doubt on its credibility\".\n\nThese include measures allowing officials to publish only regional vote tallies rather than posting the results at individual polling stations -- making it impossible for observers to verify the count.\n\nICG also cited Chad's Constitutional Council excluding 10 rival candidates from the vote in Deby strongholds.\n\nAs for Masra, it said: \"A significant proportion of his constituency now considers him to have become a stooge of those in power.\"\n\nIf Masra wins the election, it could be the first peaceful handover of power in Chad, which underwent several coups even before Deby's father seized power in 1990.\n\nMore than 8.2 million people are registered to vote in the largely desert central African nation, ranked by the United Nations as the fourth least-developed country in the world.\n\nWith a third of the population aged between 10 and 24, many are voting for the first time.\n\nResults are expected on May 21 with a possible second round on June 22.\n\nlnf-gir/rlp-kjm/bp/rlp", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lea_nkamleun_fosso@reformer.com", "name": "L\u00e9a

100 troops from Chad, after agreeing to pull out of Niger.\n\nDeby's main rival is former opposition leader and now prime minister Succes Masra, denounced as a stooge by critics in the absence of other serious challengers.\n\nBoth men have vowed a first-round win in polls that international rights groups have warned will be neither free nor fair.\n\n\"All those who have shown they want massive change must go and vote in massive numbers, peacefully,\" Masra, dressed in a blue boubou, said after voting.\n\nWhile turnout seemed slow shortly after polls opened in the capital N'Djamena, it had

But some experts say the vote is just to formalise the military's hold on power.\n\nChad has been in the throes of political upheaval since 2021, when interim President Mahamat Idriss Deby first seized power amid fierce resistance by opposition forces who challenged his legitimacy.\n\nThis February, the chaos crescendoed after government forces fatally shot Yaya Dillo - one of the strongest opposition figures - and his supporters at their party headquarters in the capital, N'Djamena.\n\nAt the same time, Chad is one of the poorest countries in the world, with at least 40 percent of the 17 million population living below the poverty line. The war in neighbouring Sudan has also pushed more than 500,000 people into Chad, adding further pressure even as fears of a spillover conflict simmer.\n\nChad's army, reputed to be among the best in the region, commands influence across the troubled Sahel, where armed group incursions and a wave of coups have created regional rifts and diminished the standing of Western powers like France and the United States.\n\n\"[Chad] is a key security partner in the fight against [armed group] Boko Haram around Lake Chad,\" said Dan Eizenga, a researcher with the Africa Center for Strategic Studies (ACSS). \"So, the electoral process in Chad has significant ramifications not just for Chad, but for several countries.\"\n\nFrance, a key backer of Chad's current government, enjoys a large military presence in the country. However, the US appears on shaky ground. Last month, the Pentagon announced it would pull out some 75 troops stationed in the country, but added the decision could change after the elections - signalling the importance of the May 6 polls beyond the continent.\n\nA second round of votes is expected on June 22, with provisional results due on July 7.\n\nHere's all you need to know about the candidates and state of play ahead of the Monday vote:\n\nThe country's Constitutional Council approved 10 candidates in March, although fierce criticism abounds for the barring of some opposition figures because of \"irregularities\" in their applications.\n\nThe main candidate, General Mahamat Idriss Deby, is the transitional president who came to power under the ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement party (MPS). He will run under the \"United Chad\" coalition, which consists of several other pro-government parties.\n\nDeby, 39, took office in April 2021, after his father, President Idriss Deby, died in action while fighting a rebel group in the north of the country. Until his death, Deby had ruled for more than 30 years.\n\nFollowing the older Deby's death, the military suspended the constitution and announced a decree establishing a Transitional Military Council to lead the country for 18 months and designating Mahamat Deby as head of the Council, and thus, head of state.\n\nDeby is one of Chad's youngest leaders, but his critics, unimpressed, have criticised him since day one for grabbing power illegally, and have asked him to step down. According to the constitution, the head of parliament ought to rule in the case of the president's death.\n\nInstead, Deby extended the transition period by several months to October 10, 2024. In a bid to legitimise his position, experts say, Deby signed peace agreements with major opposition figures in 2022.\n\nHe also proposed changes to the constitution in a referendum. In December 2023, Chadians voted \"yes\" to new measures such as the creation of local councils to devolve power from the centre; a presidential term limit reduced from six to five years, and a reduced age limit from 40 to 35 years, as well as the strengthening of the electoral agency by making it independent of the government.\n\nDeby's three-year rule is reminiscent of his father's style: iron-fisted and replete with crackdowns on the opposition, such as the protests of October 2022.\n\nMajor opposition leaders have been harassed, or in worse cases, killed, like Yaya Dillo, who was a cousin of Deby. Saleh Deby Itno, another one of Deby's relatives who was allied with Dillo, was jailed.\n\nMeanwhile, Deby has aimed to co-opt other opposition members, appointing them to high positions, a strategy that the older Deby also wielded many times.\n\nThe main approved opposition candidates for the elections include:\n\nSucces Masra - Deby's appointed prime minister and a Harvard and Oxford-educated economist, Masra was the strongest opposition figure until his appointment in January 2024, campaigning under the Transformers Party (Les Transformateurs). He was a member of the vocal opposition coalition Wakit Tama, which had started to protest the long rule of the older Deby in 2021. Following Deby senior's death and the takeover by his son, Masra led opposition protests against what was called a \"coup\". He fled the country to the US after the army opened fire on hundreds of protesters in N'Djamena on October 20, 2022, after Deby announced he would run in elections, rather than hand over power. At least 50 people were killed.\n\nHowever, Masra returned to Chad in December 2023, after peace talks with Deby's government, overseen by the regional Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) bloc. He was appointed prime minister on January 1, 2024 - a move intensely criticised by other opposition groups, who said Masra had joined the military government. On May 6, Masra will face his boss and run under the Justice and Equality (Justice-Egalite) coalition. It's the first time in the country's history that a president and a prime minister will tussle at the polls, and there are speculations around whether Masra is fronting for Deby.\n\n\"Many observers suggest that they may have some sort of gentleman's deal where whoever wins will name the other their prime minister and thus preserve the status quo,\" Eizenga of ACSS said. \"Several opposition parties ... claim that Masra provides the illusion of electoral competition.\"\n\nAlbert Pahimi Padacke - A two-time former prime minister and one-time presidential candidate under the older Deby, Albert will run under the semi-opposition RNDT-Le Reveil party or the National Rally of Chadian Democrats, which allied with the older Deby's political party at the time. He came second in the last presidential elections in April 2021.\n\nThe other candidates are:\n\nAlladoum Djarma Baltazar - a politician and founder of the Chadian Socialist Action Party for Renewal or Action pour le renouveau du Tchad (ASTRE). He also ran for president in the April 2021 elections which the older Deby won for a sixth time, just days before his death.\n\nTheophile Bongoro Bebzoune - a teacher and president of the Party for the Rally and Equity in Chad or Rassemblement pour la d\u00e9mocratie et le progr\u00e8s (PRET). He is a member of Deby's Transitional Council.\n\nLydie Beassemda - the first and only female candidate, and the current minister of education. Beassemda will run under the Party for Democracy and Independence or Parti pour la drmocratie et l'independance integrales. She first ran in 2021, but received only three percent of the vote.\n\nMansiri Lopsekreo - will run under the Elites party (Les \u00c9lites). He is an engineer and first-time candidate with growing support in northern and eastern Chad.\n\nBrice Mbaimon Guedmbaye - is running in presidential elections for the third time. He will compete under the banner of the Movement of Chadian Patriots for the Republic or Mouvement des patriotes tchadiens pour la Republique (MPTR).\n\nYacine Abdermane Sakine - a 39-year-old banker who is popular with the youth. Although running under the Reformist Party (Parti Reformiste), Yacine is also a member of the opposition coalition Wakit Tama and was arrested during protests after the military takeover in 2021.\n\nNasra Djimasngar - an academic who is running for the first time under his New Day (Un Jour Nouvel) party.\n\nSome experts say the elections are merely a formality to help Deby assure his hold on power. Since the killing of Dillo and the co-option of Masra, there has not been enough time for another strong opposition figure to emerge.\n\n\"Just the advantage of incumbency alone in this context makes this Deby's race to lose, and that's assuming that it occurs by Chad's electoral laws,\" Eizenga said. \"Consequently, Masra and Deby are really the only candidates expected to receive any significant portion of the votes.\"\n\nAlthough Deby's government set up the National Election Management Agency and Constitutional Council in January, as part of new reforms agreed to during peace talks with opposition members, critics say these agencies will tow the ruling party line as some of its commissioners were selected by President Deby.\n\nChad's economy, already poor, has shrunk in the past decade - its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, for instance, fell from $961 in 2014 to $710 in 2019, according to the World Bank. Insecurity and an overreliance on oil revenue are the major drivers. While oil is Chad's main resource, production is set to decline sharply because its reserves are limited.\n\nWith Deby set to win the election, Chad could see another decades-long strongman ruler, as well as a stagnant economy.\n\n\"I suspect that we can look back at the last six years or so and get a good idea of what the next six years will look like: essentially, a heavily tilted economy [and] high levels of corruption that benefit more or less the same networks of politically connected folks,\" Eizenga said.\n\nThere are hopes, however, that Prime Minister Masra, a world-class economist, could influence more investments in the country's education and health sectors.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Transition - UrduPoint", "body": "N'Djamena, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th May, 2024) Chadians voted Monday in an election aimed at ending three years of military rule but dismissed by opponents of junta leader Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno as a fix following violent repression.\n\nThey will choose whether to extend three decades of Deby family rule, in a country crucial in the fight against jihadism across the Sahel desert region.\n\nDeby's main rival for president is Prime Minister Succes Masra, denounced as a stooge by critics in the absence of any other serious challengers.\n\nBoth men have vowed a first-round win in the polls, which international rights groups warn will not be free or fair.\n\n\"All those who have shown they want massive change must go and vote in massive numbers, peacefully,\" Masra, dressed in a blue boubou, said after voting.\n\nShortly after polls opened, turnout appeared relatively slow at five voting stations where AFP was present.\n\n\"I'm proud of myself, I'm free and very happy to have voted for change,\" Yolane Madjilar, 58, enthused at a centre set up along a roadside in Ardep Djoumal district.\n\n\"I don't like fraud, if someone comes with me this evening, I'll go and observe the counting,\" she said.\n\nEarly in the campaign, observers predicted a massive win for Deby, 40, whose main rival has been killed and others banned from standing.\n\nHowever, economist Masra, also aged 40, has ramped up considerable support on the stump in recent weeks and could force a second round.\n\n- Proclaimed by generals -\n\nSurrounded by armed presidential guards, Deby was inaccessible to reporters but after voting declared his \"commitment\" to a \"return to the constitutional order\", his Facebook page said.\n\nHe was proclaimed transitional president by 15 generals in 2021 after his father, longtime leader Idriss Deby Itno, was killed in a gun battle with rebels after 30 years in power.\n\nKnown as MIDI for his initials and as \"the Man in Dark Glasses\", Mahamat promised an 18-month transition to democracy but later extended it by two years.\n\nOpposition figures have since fled, been silenced or joined forces with Deby, while the junta has eliminated any attempts by civil society to campaign against it.\n\nMasra was among the opponents driven out of the country but later returned and was named prime minister in January.\n\nThe eight other candidates, either little known or considered not hostile to the regime, are not expected to win many votes.\n\n- Not 'free or democratic' -\n\nThe International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) has warned that the election appears \"neither credible, free nor democratic\".\n\nIt noted \"increasing human rights violations\", including Dillo's killing.\n\nThe International Crisis Group (ICG) also warned that \"a number of problems in the run-up to the balloting cast doubt on its credibility\".\n\nThese include measures that allow officials to publish only regional tallies of votes rather than posting the results at individual polling stations -- making it impossible for observers to verify the vote count.\n\nICG also cited Chad's Constitutional Council excluding 10 rival candidates from the vote in Deby strongholds.\n\nAs for Masra, it said: \"A significant proportion of his constituency now considers him to have become a stooge of those in power\".\n\nSome analysts say however that Masra may be genuinely aiming to become president.\n\nWith a third of inhabitants aged between 10 and 24, many are voting for the first time.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idriss_D\u00e9by", "type": "person", "score": 5,

It is now up to the people to vote massively to choose their president,\" Deby said in a post on Facebook after voting.\n\nAbout 8.5-million people registered to vote. Provisional results are expected by May 21 and final results by June 5.\n\nIf no candidate wins more than 50% of the votes, a run-off will be held on June 22.\n\nOne voter in N'Djamena, Ahaya Khalil, said she was supporting Deby because he had promised to create jobs.\n\n\"Today is voting day, and thank God we've come to vote for our president of the republic. May God preserve him and our country,\" she said. \"We hope he'll give our children jobs once he's elected.\"\n\nThe vote coincides with a temporary withdrawal of US troops from Chad, an important Western ally in a region of West and Central Africa courted by Russia and racked by jihadism.\n\nSince replacing his father at the helm of the oil-producing Central African country, Deby has remained close with former colonial power and longtime ally France.\n\nWhile other junta-ruled Sahel countries, including Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, told Paris and other Western powers to withdraw and have turned to Moscow for support, Chad remains the last Sahel state with a substantial French military presence.\n\nThe US, however, announced a temporary withdrawal of at least some troops in April after an order by Chad's air force chief that the US halt activities at an airbase.\n\nOpposition concerns\n\nThe vote pits Deby against his prime minister Succes Masra, previously a political opponent who fled into exile in 2022 but was allowed back a year later. Also running are former prime minister Albert Pahimi Padacke and seven other candidates.\n\nYaya Dillo, an opposition politician who had been expected to run against Deby despite coming from the same clan, was shot and killed in the capital N'Djamena on February 28, the day the election date was announced.\n\nPadacke has accused Masra of collaborating with Deby. But Masra has attracted large crowds to his own rallies.\n\nSome opposition members and civil society groups have called for a boycott, citing concerns about possible vote-rigging.\n\nThat has raised fears of potential violence.\n\n\"This presidential election is of capital importance for the country because an entire people aspires for change,\" said Baniara Yoyana, a former minister and magistrate.\n\n\"The process must be conducted with transparency to avoid any risk of confrontation.\"\n\nSome observers did not get their accreditations before the vote and were not given any reason for the refusal, Citizens' Alliance for Elections, a platform that monitors the poll, said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nOne Deby supporter, however, said he expected no problems.\n\n\"We want the election to go well and peacefully,\" said Abdelkhader Sougui, a student. \"My wish is to go out and vote the morning of May 6 to confirm our victory ... in the first round.\"", "source": {"uri":

But by Monday afternoon, they were still unable to vote due to logistical problems, leaving many frustrated, according to the Reuters reporters.\n\n\"No one brought us a polling station or people to tell us where to vote,\" one said.\n\nAnalysts say President Mahamat Idriss Deby, who took over the day rebels killed his long-ruling father, Idriss Deby, in April 2021, is most likely to win, although his chief opponent drew larger-than-expected crowds on the campaign trail.\n\nMonday's election pitted Deby against his prime minister Succes Masra, previously a political opponent who fled into exile in 2022 but was allowed back a year later.

Provisional results are expected by May 21 and final results by June 5.\n\nIf no candidate wins more than 50% of the votes, a run-off will be held on June 22.\n\nSecurity and the economy have been key campaign issues. Voters are also concerned about the high cost of living and access to water and electricity.\n\nAhaya Khalil, a voter in N'Djamena, said she was supporting Deby because he had promised to create jobs.\n\n\"We've come to vote for our president of the republic,\" she said. \"We hope he'll give our children jobs once he's elected.\"\n\nAnother voter, Mahamat Issa, said he was voting for \"peace, security and stability\" for the country.\n\n\"Also, the population suffers from the cost of living -- the future president must think about social issues,\" he added.\n\nThe vote coincides with a temporary withdrawal of U.S. troops from Chad, an important Western ally in a region of West and Central Africa courted by Russia and racked by jihadism.\n\nSince replacing his father at the helm of the oil-producing nation, Deby has remained close with former colonial power and longtime ally France.\n\nWhile other junta-ruled Sahel countries, including Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, have told Paris and other Western powers to withdraw and turned to Moscow for support, Chad remains the last Sahel state with a substantial French military presence.\n\nThe U.S., however, announced a temporary

The polls close at 5 pm N'Djamena time, with provisional results expected in two weeks and final outcome on June 5.\n\nA second round will be held on June 22, in case no candidate wins with more than 50 percent of the vote in the first round.\n\nThough there are ten candidates in the election, the race to occupy the country's highest office, analysts say, is a two-horse race between the junta leader and his prime minister, Succes Masra, with Deby predicted to give his challenger a first-round knockout.\n\nRead: Deby's rivals pale in comparison ahead of Chad elections\n\nDr Evariste Ngarlem Tolde, a political scientist and researcher at the University of N'Djamena, says the junta leader would win the polls.\n\n\"There is no election; this is a selection with already known results...the election would hardly go into the second round, except they want to pretend to make it look democratic.\"\n\nA former fierce critic of the N'Djamena regime, Masra was appointed Prime Minister of the transition government in January following his return from exile. He has been attracting large crowds in the capital N'Djamena since campaigns kicked off.\n\nHowever, other opposition leaders, including Albert Pahimi Padacke, a former prime minister and regular contender, who came in second in the country's previous election which Deby's father, Idriss Deby Itno, won in April 2021 before he was killed, have accused Masra of collaborating with Deby the son.\n\nDr Tolde agrees that Masra's candidacy is a farce for a make-believe democracy to legitimise the Deby dynasty.\n\n\"The result of this election will hardly reflect the votes of electors. We saw it during the referendum [in December 2023], where polling stations were deserted but they said participation rate was 66 percent,\" he said.\n\nThe said referendum endorsed a revised constitution, which has been heavily criticised as it gave the junta leader the leverage to run for the ongoing election, which if he easily wins as predicted, could potentially make the country a family business.\n\nDeby seized power in a military coup in April 2021 following the death of his father who rebels killed at the battlefield shortly after winning an election to extend his three-decades rule of the country.\n\nDeby the son initially pledged to return power to democratic rule within 18 months but later extended it by two years. Now he is on course to becoming the country's civilian president.\n\nChad has been in turmoil since independence and Mohamed Kheir Omer an African writer and researcher based in Norway thinks a victory for another Deby, could further plunge the country that has never experienced a peaceful electoral transition of power into more violence.\n\nRead: Chad opposition leader killed in foiled state attack\n\n\"The results of the elections [Deby's victory] may lead to more violence as there is at present a family feud among the Zaghawa who have dominated the military and politics in the country, though they are less than one percent of Chad's population,\" Mr Omer said.", "source": {"uri": "theeastafrican.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The East African"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idriss_D\u00e9by", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Idriss D\u00e9by"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N'Djamena", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "N'Djamena"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "N'Djamena"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chad"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Military dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chad"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chad"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahamat_Idriss", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahamat Idriss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saur_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saur Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_N'Djamena", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of N'Djamena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaceful_transition_of_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peaceful transition of power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaghawa_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zaghawa people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/resource/blob/4614754/b36900880fbcf92d3f29a75d0d966319/deby-data.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541682", "eventUri": "eng-9541682", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 547, "textEnd": 553}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 587, "textEnd": 594}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

But by Monday afternoon, they were still unable to vote due to logistical problems, leaving many frustrated, according to the Reuters reporters.\n\n\"No one brought us a polling station or people to tell us where to vote,\" one said.\n\nAnalysts say President Mahamat Idriss Deby, who took over the day rebels killed his long-ruling father, Idriss Deby, in April 2021, is most likely to win, although his chief opponent drew larger-than-expected crowds on the campaign trail.\n\nMonday's election pitted Deby against his prime minister Succes Masra, previously a political opponent who fled into exile in 2022 but was allowed back a year later. Also running were former prime minister Albert Pahimi Padacke and seven other candidates.\n\nYaya Dillo, an opposition politician who had been expected to run against Deby despite coming from the same clan, was shot and killed in N'Djamena on Feb. 28, the day the election date was announced.\n\nSome opposition members and civil society groups had called for a boycott, citing concerns about possible vote-rigging.\n\nSome observers did not get their accreditations before the vote and were not given any reason for the refusal, Citizens' Alliance for Elections, a platform that monitors the poll, said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nDeby, who voted early on Monday in N'Djamena, has promised to bolster security, strengthen the rule of law and increase electricity production.\n\nSome 8.5 million people were registered to vote. Provisional results are expected by May 21 and final results by June 5.\n\nIf no candidate wins more than 50% of the votes, a run-off will be held on June 22.\n\nSecurity and the economy have been key campaign issues. Voters are also concerned about the high cost of living and access to water and electricity.\n\nAhaya Khalil, a voter in N'Djamena, said she was supporting Deby because he had promised to create jobs.\n\n\"We've come to vote for our president of the republic,\" she said. \"We hope he'll give our children jobs once he's elected.\"\n\nAnother voter, Mahamat Issa, said he was voting for \"peace, security and stability\" for the country.\n\n\"Also, the population suffers from the cost of living -- the future president must think about social issues,\" he added.\n\nThe vote coincides with a temporary withdrawal of U.S. troops from Chad, an important Western ally in a region of West and Central Africa courted by Russia and racked by jihadism.\n\nSince replacing his father at the helm of the oil-producing nation, Deby has remained close with former colonial power and longtime ally France.\n\nWhile other junta-ruled Sahel countries, including Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, have told Paris and other Western powers to withdraw and turned to Moscow for support, Chad remains the last Sahel state with a substantial French military presence.\n\nThe U.S., however, announced a temporary withdrawal of at least some troops last month following an order by Chad's air force chief that the U.S. halt activities at an air base.\n\n(Reporting by Mahamat Ramadane and Desire Danga Essigue;

But by Monday afternoon, they were still unable to vote due to logistical problems, leaving many frustrated, according to the Reuters reporters.\n\n\"No one brought us a polling station or people to tell us where to vote,\" one said.\n\nAnalysts say President Mahamat Idriss Deby, who took over the day rebels killed his long-ruling father, Idriss Deby, in April 2021, is most likely to win, although his chief opponent drew larger-than-expected crowds on the campaign trail.\n\nMonday's election pitted Deby against his prime minister Succes Masra, previously a political opponent who fled into exile in 2022 but was allowed back a year later. Also running were former prime minister Albert Pahimi Padacke and seven other candidates.\n\nYaya Dillo, an opposition politician who had been expected to run against Deby despite coming from the same clan, was shot and killed in N'Djamena on Feb. 28, the day the election date was announced.\n\nSome opposition members and civil society groups had called for a boycott, citing concerns about possible vote-rigging.\n\nThat has raised fears of potential violence.\n\nSECURITY AND ECONOMY KEY ISSUES\n\nSome observers did not get their accreditations before the vote and were not given any reason for the refusal, Citizens' Alliance for Elections, a platform that monitors the poll, said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nDeby, who voted early on Monday in N'Djamena, has promised to bolster security, strengthen the rule of law and increase electricity production.\n\nSome 8.5 million people were registered to vote. Provisional results are expected by May 21 and final results by June 5.\n\nIf no candidate wins more than 50% of the votes, a run-off will be held on June 22.\n\nSecurity and the economy have been key campaign issues. Voters are also concerned about the high cost of living and access to water and electricity.\n\nAhaya Khalil, a voter in N'Djamena, said she was supporting Deby because he had promised to create jobs.\n\n\"We've come to vote for our president of the republic,\" she said. \"We hope he'll give our children jobs once he's elected.\"\n\nAnother voter, Mahamat Issa, said he was voting for \"peace, security and stability\" for the country.\n\n\"Also, the population suffers from the cost of living - the future president must think about social issues,\" he added.\n\nThe vote coincides with a temporary withdrawal of U.S. troops from Chad, an important Western ally in a region of West and Central Africa courted by Russia and racked by jihadism.\n\nSince replacing his father at the helm of the oil-producing nation, Deby has remained close with former colonial power and longtime ally France.\n\nWhile other junta-ruled Sahel countries, including Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, have told Paris and other Western powers to withdraw and turned to Moscow for support, Chad remains the last Sahel state with a substantial French military presence.\n\nThe U.S., however, announced a temporary withdrawal of at least some troops last month following an order by Chad's air force chief that the U.S. halt activities at an air base.

(Denis Sassou Gueipeur/AFP/Getty Images/TNS)\n\nChad's military ruler Mahamat Deby is almost certain to win the country's May 6 presidential election, cementing the ruling junta's power in a move that could jeopardize the future of U.S. military engagement in the region.\n\nThe election comes as Chad has become the last remaining military ally of the U.S., France and its European partners in the fight against Islamist insurgents and Russian influence in West Africa's Sahel region. But that alliance may be fraying, highlighting how politically salient anti-Western sentiment has become in the Sahel.\n\nChad's decision last month to ask the U.S. to withdraw its troops from an army base in the capital, N'djamena, shows how even a stalwart Western ally like Deby, running in an election he is guaranteed to win, was compelled to push back on Western presence, said Remadji Hoinathy, Central Africa analyst at the Dakar-based Institute for Security Studies.\n\n\"With anti-French sentiment on the rise, Deby wants to be seen as less dependent on the West by asking some U.S. troops to leave,\" Hoinathy said.\n\nChad is in the middle of a belt of countries that have suffered coups since 2020 that stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. French troops have been forced to leave neighboring Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso after their ruling juntas forged closer ties to Moscow.\n\nThis week the U.S. said it would temporarily withdraw its roughly 100 troops from Chad and hundreds from neighboring Niger after the military rulers there cut security agreements with the U.S. and invited Russian forces to deploy. Lloyd Austin, U.S. defense secretary, on Friday confirmed reports that Russian soldiers were now stationed at an airbase used by U.S. troops in Niger's capital, Niamey.\n\nThey \"are in a separate compound and don't have access to U.S. forces or access to our equipment,\" he told reporters in Honolulu.\n\nDeby's taken advantage of the emerging multipolar world order, reinforcing ties with Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Russia while maintaining relations with France and the U.S., at least for now, said Yamingu\u00e9 Betinbaye, a political analyst and research director at the Anthropology and Human Sciences Research Center in N'djamena.\n\n\"France is too strategic at the moment for Deby to cut ties, but he can at least show that Chad is a sovereign country that won't accept to be bullied into choosing sides or only working with some partners,\" Betinbaye said. Ex-colonial power France has roughly 1,000 soldiers stationed in the country.\n\nThe continued U.S. presence in Chad is still in limbo after it failed to reach an agreement for its troops to remain at a French army base. The Stuttgart-based U.S. Africa Command didn't respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nIn recent weeks, Deby has -- like many of his fellow military leaders in the region -- highlighted his belief in sovereignty. \"Chad's a free and sovereign country,\" Deby told Paris-based Radio France International in a April 24 interview. \"We're not going to act like a slave who wants to change his master.\"\n\nFather's son\n\nThe 40-year-old general took power in 2021, following the death of his father, Idriss Deby, a dictator who led the country for three decades. He has continued his father's tradition of crushing opposition, said Rakhis Ahmat Saleh of the Parti pour le renouveau d\u00e9mocratique au Tchad, whose candidacy was rejected on the basis he couldn't prove his parents were Chadian.\n\n\"The government doesn't want to face credible opposition at the polls,\" he said.\n\nTen other candidates remain in the race, including current Prime Minister Succes Masra, widely seen as Deby's main challenger. The previously exiled opposition leader took up the position in government this year after reaching an agreement with the military.\n\nAnalysts say it's unclear whether Masra's presidential bid is orchestrated by the junta to present the vote as credible or a genuine attempt to challenge Deby at the polls.\n\n\"The large support from Chadians shows they believe in me as their candidate,\" Masra said via Zoom from N'Djamena. \"Once elected president, I'm ready to sit down with the U.S. to find a win-win solution for both our countries.\"\n\nDeby first vowed to oversee a transition to democratic rule in the landlocked oil producer within 18 months before extending that period and finally announcing he was running for president. The killing in February of prominent opposition leader Yaya Dillo followed by the electoral body's barring of other major opponents and Masra's return have given the sense that the vote is rigged and designed to legitimize Deby's rule.\n\n\"To legitimize his power, Deby needs to beat a credible opponent,\" Betinbaye said.\n\nDespite the criticism, Masra's campaign has seen a significant following, particularly in his southern opposition stronghold. A former African Development Bank economist, Masra highlights his economic expertise to win support in Chad, one of the world's poorest countries, heavily indebted and facing food and power shortages, and a humanitarian crisis made worse by the influx of over half a million refugees from the war in Sudan.\n\nOut of Chad's 16 million population, 8 million voters have registered for Monday's election. Results are expected within two weeks. If there's no clear winner in the first round, a second round will be held on June 22.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Soldiers and riot police patrolled the streets alongside at least 30 armoured and other military vehicles in the opposition-friendly southern neighbourhoods of the capital N'Djamena, according to Reuters reporters.\n\nChad deployed dozens of security forces in the capital amid rising tensions on Monday as polls closed and vote counting began in the first presidential election in Africa's Sahel region since a wave of coups.\n\nSoldiers and riot police patrolled the streets alongside at least 30 armoured and other military vehicles in the opposition-friendly southern neighbourhoods of the capital N'Djamena, according to Reuters reporters. The streets, normally bustling in the final hours of voting, were quiet.\n\nAt least one voter was killed in the Central African country's second-largest city Moundou, south N'Djamena, after unidentified gunmen opened fire at a polling station, Chadian media reported. Nomads, who make up\n\naround 7% of Chad's population, were meant to begin early voting on Sunday. But by Monday afternoon, they were still unable to vote due to logistical problems, leaving many frustrated, according to the Reuters reporters.\n\n\"No one brought us a polling station or people to tell us where to vote,\" one said. Analysts say President Mahamat Idriss Deby, who took over the day rebels killed his long-ruling father, Idriss Deby, in April 2021, is most likely to win, although his chief opponent drew larger-than-expected crowds on the campaign trail.\n\nMonday's election pitted Deby against his prime minister Succes Masra, previously a political opponent who fled into exile in 2022 but was allowed back a year later. Also running were former prime minister Albert Pahimi Padacke and seven other candidates. Yaya Dillo, an opposition politician who had been expected to run against Deby despite coming from the same clan, was shot and killed in N'Djamena on Feb. 28, the day the election date was announced.\n\nSome opposition members and civil society groups had called for a boycott, citing concerns about possible vote-rigging. That has raised fears of potential violence.\n\nSECURITY AND ECONOMY KEY ISSUES Some observers did not get their accreditations before the vote and were not given any reason for the refusal, Citizens' Alliance for Elections, a platform that monitors the poll, said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nDeby, who voted early on Monday in N'Djamena, has promised to bolster security, strengthen the rule of law and increase electricity production. Some 8.5 million people were registered to vote. Provisional results are expected by May 21 and final results by June 5.\n\nIf no candidate wins more than 50% of the votes, a run-off will be held on June 22. Security and the economy have been key campaign issues. Voters are also concerned about the high cost of living and access to water and electricity.\n\nAhaya Khalil, a voter in N'Djamena, said she was supporting Deby because he had promised to create jobs. \"We've come to vote for our president of the republic,\" she said. \"We hope he'll give our children jobs once he's elected.\"\n\nAnother voter, Mahamat Issa, said he was voting for \"peace, security and stability\" for the country. \"Also, the population suffers from the cost of living -- the future president must think about social issues,\" he added.\n\nThe vote coincides with a temporary withdrawal of U.S. troops from Chad, an important Western ally in a region of West and Central Africa courted by Russia and racked by jihadism. Since replacing his father at the helm of the oil-producing nation, Deby has remained close with former colonial power and longtime ally France.\n\nWhile other junta-ruled Sahel countries, including Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, have told Paris and other Western powers to withdraw and turned to Moscow for support, Chad remains the last Sahel state with a substantial French military presence. The U.S., however, announced a temporary withdrawal of at least some troops last month following an order by Chad's air force chief that the U.S. halt activities at an air base.\n\n(This story has not

But that alliance may be fraying, highlighting how politically salient anti-Western sentiment has become in the Sahel.\n\nChad's decision last month to ask the U.S. to withdraw its troops from an army base in the capital, N'djamena, shows how even a stalwart Western ally like Deby, running in an election he is guaranteed to win, was compelled to push back on Western presence, said Remadji Hoinathy, Central Africa analyst at the Dakar-based Institute for Security Studies.\n\n\"With anti-French sentiment on the rise, Deby wants to be seen as less dependent on the West by asking some U.S. troops to leave,\" Hoinathy said.\n\nChad is in the middle of a belt of countries that have suffered coups since 2020 that stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. French troops have been forced to leave neighboring Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso after their ruling juntas forged closer ties to Moscow.\n\nThis week the U.S. said it would temporarily withdraw its roughly 100 troops from Chad and hundreds from neighboring Niger after the military rulers there cut security agreements with the U.S. and invited Russian forces to deploy. Lloyd Austin, U.S. defense secretary, on Friday confirmed reports that Russian soldiers were now stationed at an airbase used by U.S. troops in Niger's capital, Niamey.\n\nThey \"are in a separate compound and don't have access to U.S. forces or access to our equipment,\" he told reporters in Honolulu.\n\nDeby's taken advantage of the emerging multipolar world order, reinforcing ties with Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Russia while maintaining relations with France and the U.S., at least for now, said Yamingu\u00e9 Betinbaye, a political analyst and research director at the Anthropology and Human Sciences Research Center in N'djamena.\n\n\"France is too strategic at the moment for Deby to cut ties, but he can at least show that Chad is a sovereign country that won't accept to be bullied into choosing sides or only working with some partners,\" Betinbaye said. Ex-colonial power France has roughly 1,000 soldiers stationed in the country.\n\nThe continued U.S. presence in Chad is still in limbo after it failed to reach an agreement for its troops to remain at a French army base. The Stuttgart-based U.S. Africa Command didn't respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nIn recent weeks, Deby has - like many of his fellow military leaders in the region - highlighted his belief in sovereignty. \"Chad's a free and sovereign country,\" Deby told Paris-based Radio France International in a April 24 interview. \"We're not going to act like a slave who wants to change his master.\"\n\nFather's son\n\nThe 40-year-old general took power in 2021, following the death of his father, Idriss Deby, a dictator who led the country for three decades. He has continued his father's tradition of crushing opposition, said Rakhis Ahmat Saleh of the Parti pour le renouveau d\u00e9mocratique au Tchad, whose candidacy was rejected on the basis he couldn't prove his parents were Chadian.\n\n\"The government doesn't want to face credible opposition at the polls,\" he said.\n\nTen other candidates remain in the race, including current Prime Minister Succes Masra, widely seen as Deby's main challenger. The previously exiled opposition leader took up the position in government this year after reaching an agreement with the military.\n\nAnalysts say it's unclear whether Masra's presidential bid is orchestrated by the junta to present the vote as credible or a genuine attempt to challenge Deby at the polls.\n\n\"The large support from Chadians shows they believe in me as their candidate,\" Masra said via Zoom from N'Djamena. \"Once elected president, I'm ready to sit down with the U.S. to find a win-win solution for both our countries.\"\n\nDeby first vowed to oversee a transition to democratic rule in the landlocked oil producer within 18 months before extending that period and finally announcing he was running for president. The killing in February of prominent opposition leader Yaya Dillo followed by the electoral body's barring of other major opponents and Masra's return have given the sense that the vote is rigged and designed to legitimize Deby's rule.\n\n\"To legitimize his power, Deby needs to beat a credible opponent,\" Betinbaye said.\n\nDespite the criticism, Masra's campaign has seen a significant following, particularly in his southern opposition stronghold. A former African Development Bank economist, Masra highlights his economic expertise to win support in Chad, one of the world's poorest countries, heavily indebted and facing food and power shortages, and a humanitarian crisis made worse by the influx of over half a million refugees from the war in Sudan.\n\nOut of Chad's 16 million population, 8 million voters have registered for Monday's election. Results are expected within two weeks. If there's no clear winner in the first round, a second round will be held on June 22.", "source": {"uri": "thestate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The State"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Addressing supporters in the capital, N'Djamena, Masra, a former executive of the African Development Bank, pledged a brighter future for the country's youth, emphasising job creation as a central focus.\n\nHis platform includes a bold five-year plan aimed at generating 200,000 jobs, evenly distributed between the private and public sectors, forming what he calls a \"minimum package of dignity.\" Masra's grassroots movement also pledges to tackle pressing issues like access to essential services such as electricity, water, and ensuring security for all citizens, as reported by Africanews.\n\n\"We aspire to a nation of peace and reconciliation, where victory is not merely partisan, but a collective triumph for all Chadians,\" Masra asserted, advocating for hope and progress over past challenges.\n\nAhead of the polls, Masra urged his supporters to remain vigilant throughout the electoral process, emphasising the importance of transparent and fair elections.\n\nElsewhere in the city, General Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, commonly known as \"MIDI,\" the country's interim president, addressed his supporters. Deby ascended to power three years ago following the demise of his father, Idriss Deby, who ruled Chad with an iron fist for three decades.\n\nDespite initially promising elections within 18 months, Deby's government postponed the vote, allowing him to participate as a presidential candidate. He enjoys widespread support from a diverse coalition of political parties and civil society organisations, with many anticipating his victory.\n\n\"Our candidate's success is assured, unmatched by any other contender,\" declared supporter Abakar Bishala, expressing confidence in Deby's leadership during a rally.\n\nDeby's backers highlight his achievements in enhancing national defence and security, fostering reconciliation, and overseeing constitutional referendums.\n\nHowever, some opposition factions and civil society groups have called for a boycott of the election.\n\nPolling stations opened at seven on Monday morning, with results anticipated on May 21 and a potential second round on June 22.\n\nChad's election marks a significant milestone as the nation emerges from a period of political upheaval, becoming the first among neighbouring countries, which have witnessed coups in recent years, to undergo democratic proceedings, Africanews reported.\n\nChad's longstanding leader, President Idriss Deby, succumbed to his injuries in April 2021 sustained on the frontline in the northern region of the country, where he had travelled to offer support to soldiers engaged in combat against rebel forces, despite plans for a victory address, the president opted to visit Chadian troops fighting insurgents, Al Jazeera reported.

Despite concerns raised by international human rights groups about the fairness of the election, Deby remains confident, promising a decisive victory in the first round.\n\nThe political landscape has been marred by the killing of Deby's main rival and the banning of other candidates, raising doubts about the legitimacy of the process.\n\nFollowing the death of his father, Idriss Deby Itno, in 2021, Mahamat Deby assumed the role of transition leader and pledged an 18-month path to democracy, which was later extended by two years.\n\nOpposition figures have faced various challenges, including fleeing the country, being silenced, or aligning themselves with Deby's regime.\n\nThe junta has also suppressed any attempts by civil society to campaign against it. Tragically, on October 20, 2022, the army and police opened fire on demonstrators, including members of Masra's party, the Transformers, who were protesting against the extension of the transition period.\n\nAccording to international NGOs, approximately 300 young people have tragically lost their lives, while the regime claims that the number is around 50.\n\nYaya Dillo Djerou, who is both Deby's cousin and chief election rival, was reportedly shot at close range in the head during an army assault on February 28, as stated by his party.\n\nAlthough driven out of the country, Masra later returned and was appointed as prime minister in January.\n\nThe remaining eight candidates, who are either relatively unknown or perceived as non-hostile towards the regime, are not expected to garner significant votes.\n\nExpressing concern, the International Federation for Human Rights declared on Friday that the election lacks credibility, freedom, and democracy.\n\nThe organization also highlighted the escalating human rights violations in the country, including the killing of Dillo.\n\nThe International Crisis Group (ICG) cautioned that several issues leading up to the election raise doubts about its credibility.\n\nThese issues include the provision that allows officials to only publish regional vote tallies instead of posting results at individual polling stations, thereby preventing observers from verifying the vote count.\n\nAdditionally, the ICG pointed out the decision made by Chad's Constitutional Council to exclude 10 rival candidates from the vote in Deby's strongholds.", "source": {"uri": "naijanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_ogunsile@naijanews.com", "name": "Richard Ogunsile", "type": "author",

Addressing supporters in the capital, N'Djamena, Masra, a former executive of the African Development Bank, pledged a brighter future for the country's youth, emphasising job creation as a central focus.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan Shocker: Policeman Booked for Raping Transgender in Gujrat City of Punjab Province.\n\nHis platform includes a bold five-year plan aimed at generating 200,000 jobs, evenly distributed between the private and public sectors, forming what he calls a \"minimum package of dignity.\" Masra's grassroots movement also pledges to tackle pressing issues like access to essential services such as electricity, water, and ensuring security for all citizens, as reported by Africanews.\n\n\"We aspire to a nation of peace and reconciliation, where victory is not merely partisan, but a collective triumph for all Chadians,\" Masra asserted, advocating for hope and progress over past challenges.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan Shocker: Three Men Videotape College Student Unclothed, Blackmail Him; Arrested.\n\nAhead of the polls, Masra urged his supporters to remain vigilant throughout the electoral process, emphasising the importance of transparent and fair elections.\n\nElsewhere in the city, General Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, commonly known as \"MIDI,\" the country's interim president, addressed his supporters. Deby ascended to power three years ago following the demise of his father, Idriss Deby, who ruled Chad with an iron fist for three decades.\n\nDespite initially promising elections within 18 months, Deby's government postponed the vote, allowing him to participate as a presidential candidate. He enjoys widespread support from a diverse coalition of political parties and civil society organisations, with many anticipating his victory.\n\n\"Our candidate's success is assured, unmatched by any other contender,\" declared supporter Abakar Bishala, expressing confidence in Deby's leadership during a rally.\n\nDeby's backers highlight his achievements in enhancing national defence and security, fostering reconciliation, and overseeing constitutional referendums.\n\nHowever, some opposition factions and civil society groups have called for a boycott of the election.\n\nPolling stations opened at seven on Monday morning, with results anticipated on May 21 and a potential second round on June 22.\n\nChad's election marks a significant milestone as the nation emerges from a period of political upheaval, becoming the first among neighbouring countries, which have witnessed coups in recent years, to undergo democratic proceedings, Africanews reported.\n\nChad's longstanding leader, President Idriss Deby, succumbed to his injuries in April 2021 sustained on the frontline in the northern region of the country, where he had travelled to offer support to soldiers engaged in combat against rebel forces, despite plans for a victory address, the president opted to visit Chadian troops fighting insurgents, Al Jazeera reported.

However, Chad's National Election Management Agency, known as ANGE, said that several thousand polling stations opened late due to what they call logistical difficulties.\n\nChad's transitional president General Mahamat Idriss Deby voted in N'djamena's second district and pleaded with civilians to go out en masse and perform their civic duty of voting for the person who will manage Chad's affairs for the next five years.\n\nChad's transitional president and presidential election candidate Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno (C) casts his ballot at a polling station in N'Djamena on May 6, 2024.\n\nANGE says 8.2 million people are registered to vote. It says Chad's military has been deployed to protect voters' safety in over 26,500 polling stations.\n\nChad says over 2,500 national and international observers from 120 groups are accredited to monitor the elections. It says applications from another 60 groups were rejected for not respecting the country's laws.\n\nCyrille Nguiegang Ntchassep is the spokesperson for observers from the six-nation Central African Economic and Monetary Commission. He has concerns that peace will not hold.\n\nHe says perceivable tensions over a ban on filming or taking photos of result sheets in polling stations and publishing them on social media and radio and television are likely to degenerate into violent clashes because civilians think that the central African state's elections management body is controlled by Deby who created it. Ntchassep says he does not understand why Chad is reluctant to proclaim election results in a day or two as was the case in Senegal's March 24 presidential polls.\n\nA voter marks his ballot in a voting booth at the Walia high school polling station in N'Djamena on May 6, 2024.\n\nOpposition and civil society groups, including the Transformers Party of Deby's main challenger Succces Masra, said they planned to photograph the election result sheets and distribute them to the international community. They say the move is to prevent ANGE from rigging the elections in favor of Deby.\n\nTahir Oloy Hassan is ANGE's spokesperson. Hassan says ANGE is a permanent, independent and impartial body that does not receive orders from any state authority including Deby.\n\nHe says the ban on filming and taking photos of result sheets and prohibition of media organs from having access to some polling stations and sensitive areas is to reduce tensions that may arise from misinformation and manipulation by people who want to see Chad in chaos.\n\nHe said claims by opposition candidates that Chad's military was instructed to vote for Deby when they went to the polls on Sunday are unfounded.\n\nANGE says it has up to May 21 to publish provisional results and only Chad's Constitutional Council has the powers to proclaim definitive results.\n\nThe elections are design to end three years of transition that followed the death of Idriss Deby Itno in 2021.\n\nChad's opposition and civil society says the younger Deby's rule was marked by political tensions including October 2022 pro-democracy protests during which the central African state's security forces killed at least 50 people, injured 300 and arrested several hundred others.", "source": {"uri": "northernirelandnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northern

The move on Monday makes the Central African country the first to hold elections in the region since a series of recent coups.\n\nMore than 8 million people out of Chad's population of approximately 18 million have registered to vote. They will choose from ten candidates, including transitional leader Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, also known as Mahamat Kaka.\n\nMahamat Kaka took power in 2021 when his long-ruling father, Idriss Deby Itno, was killed fighting rebels. He initially pledged to hold elections within 18 months. However, in 2022, the military regime extended the deadline by two years, until October 2024, sparking protests that killed over 100 civilians.\n\nThe former French colony adopted a new constitution after a referendum last December, allowing Mahamat Kaka to run for president. He announced his presidential bid in March after a coalition of 221 political parties and associations endorsed his candidacy. He has pledged to promote fair, equitable, and effective governance for the development of Chad.\n\n\"Today I'm upholding a fourth commitment which was to complete the transition process launched in our country three years ago. It is now up to the people to vote massively to choose their president,\" the interim leader said in a Facebook post after voting on Monday.\n\nHis candidacy announcement came just days after his presumed main opponent, Yaya Dillo, leader of the opposition Socialist Party Without Borders (PSF), was shot and killed in Chad's capital, N'Djamena. The government accused Dillo, who was also Mahamat Kaka's cousin, of carrying out a deadly armed raid on the National State Security Agency. His party denied the allegations, claiming that he was assassinated to prevent him from running in the May election.\n\nAnalysts cited by Reuters believe the elections on Monday will be a battle between Success Masra, the landlocked nation's prime minister, and Mahamat Kaka.\n\nMasra, a former opposition leader, went into exile following protests against the military regime in October 2022, sparked by the government's decision to extend the transition period for two years. He returned to Chad last November after a reconciliation agreement with the government and was only appointed premier in January.\n\nOn Saturday, the final day of campaigning, Masra promised to address youth unemployment with a five-year plan that would create 200,000 jobs.\n\nThe results of the voting are expected on May 21, with a runoff in June if necessary, according to the Chadian electoral commission.\n\nThe elections come after the US announced a temporary withdrawal of at least some troops from Chad last month, when the military authorities ordered American forces to halt activities at an airbase. The country has, however, remained the last ally of former colonial power France in the Sahel after Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger severed ties with Paris following coups.", "source": {"uri":

The move on Monday makes the Central African country the first to hold elections in the region since a series of recent coups.\n\nMore than 8 million people out of Chad's population of approximately 18 million have registered to vote. They will choose from ten candidates, including transitional leader Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, also known as Mahamat Kaka.\n\nMahamat Kaka took power in 2021 when his long-ruling father, Idriss Deby Itno, was killed fighting rebels. He initially pledged to hold elections within 18 months. However, in 2022, the military regime extended the deadline by two years, until October 2024, sparking protests that killed over 100 civilians.\n\nThe former French colony adopted a new constitution after a referendum last December, allowing Mahamat Kaka to run for president. He announced his presidential bid in March after a coalition of 221 political parties and associations endorsed his candidacy. He has pledged to promote fair, equitable, and effective governance for the development of Chad.\n\n\"Today I'm upholding a fourth commitment which was to complete the transition process launched in our country three years ago. It is now up to the people to vote massively to choose their president,\" the interim leader said in a Facebook post after voting on Monday.\n\nHis candidacy announcement came just days after his presumed main opponent, Yaya Dillo, leader of the opposition Socialist Party Without Borders (PSF), was shot and killed in Chad's capital, N'Djamena. The government accused Dillo, who was also Mahamat Kaka's cousin, of carrying out a deadly armed raid on the National State Security Agency. His party denied the allegations, claiming that he was assassinated to prevent him from running in the May election.\n\nAnalysts cited by Reuters believe the elections on Monday will be a battle between Success Masra, the landlocked nation's prime minister, and Mahamat Kaka.\n\nMasra, a former opposition leader, went into exile following protests against the military regime in October 2022, sparked by the government's decision to extend the transition period for two years. He returned to Chad last November after a reconciliation agreement with the government and was only appointed premier in January.\n\nOn Saturday, the final day of campaigning, Masra promised to address youth unemployment with a five-year plan that would create 200,000 jobs.\n\nThe results of the voting are expected on May 21, with a runoff in June if necessary, according to the Chadian electoral commission.\n\nThe elections come after the US announced a temporary withdrawal of at least some troops from Chad last month, when the military authorities ordered American forces to halt activities at an airbase. The country has, however, remained the last ally of former colonial power France in the Sahel after Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger severed ties with Paris following coups.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com",

Transitional President General Mahamat Idriss Deby is facing nine challengers, including his current prime minister. The election, designed to end three years of a military government, has been peaceful so far. However, there is tension over a ban on taking pictures of election result sheets at polling stations.\n\nHundreds of people started arriving at polling stations in Chad's capital N'djamena as early as 5:30 am local time.\n\nAmong the voters at the University of N'djamena was 29-year-old student Abdel Koura. He says he came out early to vote because he wants a president that will bring peace and provide jobs for youths who are unemployed after completing their education.\n\nKoura says voting is his civic right. He says he is calling on all civilians, especially youths, to come out in huge numbers and vote for their leader in peace. He says he is also pleading with Chad's transitional government to avoid chaos by ensuring that the elections are transparent and free and the winner would be who civilians have voted for.\n\nEarly voting was peaceful. However, Chad's National Election Management Agency, known as ANGE, said that several thousand polling stations opened late due to what they call logistical difficulties.\n\nChad's transitional president General Mahamat Idriss Deby voted in N'djamena's second district and pleaded with civilians to go out en masse and perform their civic duty of voting for the person who will manage Chad's affairs for the next five years.\n\nANGE says 8.2 million people are registered to vote. It says Chad's military has been deployed to protect voters' safety in over 26,500 polling stations.\n\nChad says over 2,500 national and international observers from 120 groups are accredited to monitor the elections. It says applications from another 60 groups were rejected for not respecting the country's laws.\n\nCyrille Nguiegang Ntchassep is the spokesperson for observers from the six-nation Central African Economic and Monetary Commission. He has concerns that peace will not hold.\n\nHe says perceivable tensions over a ban on filming or taking photos of result sheets in polling stations and publishing them on social media and radio and television are likely to degenerate into violent clashes because civilians think that the central African state's elections management body is controlled by Deby who created it. Ntchassep says he does not understand why Chad is reluctant to proclaim election results in a day or two as was the case in Senegal's March 24 presidential polls.\n\nOpposition and civil society groups, including the Transformers Party of Deby's main challenger Succces Masra, said they planned to photograph the election result sheets and distribute them to the international community. They say the move is to prevent ANGE from rigging the elections in favor of Deby.\n\nTahir Oloy Hassan is ANGE's spokesperson. Hassan says ANGE is a permanent, independent and impartial body that does not receive orders from any state authority including Deby.\n\nHe says the ban on filming and taking photos of result sheets and prohibition of media organs from having access to some polling stations and sensitive areas is to reduce tensions that may arise from misinformation and manipulation by people who want to see Chad in chaos.\n\nHe said claims by opposition candidates that Chad's military was instructed to vote for Deby when they went to the polls on Sunday are unfounded.\n\nANGE says it has up to May 21 to publish provisional results and only Chad's Constitutional Council has the powers to proclaim definitive results.\n\nThe elections are design to end three years of transition that followed the death of Idriss Deby Itno in 2021.\n\nChad's opposition and civil society says the younger Deby's rule was marked by political tensions including October 2022 pro-democracy protests during which the central African state's security forces killed at least 50 people, injured 300 and arrested several hundred others.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"},

He has been ramping up considerable support on the stump in recent weeks and is seen by southerners as their standard-bearer.\n\n- Blood money -\n\n\"Here, when we don't like something, we say so. It's the same between a chief and a simple citizen, we don't consider chiefs to be sacred, unlike in the north,\" said Moundou's Bishop Joachim Kouraleyo Tarounga.\n\nCultural differences also stem from religious differences, Tarounga said.\n\nNotably, so-called \"diya\" or blood money in Islamic law, where compensation is paid to families of homicide victims, is highly resented in the south.\n\n\"It comes from the north,\" said Sylver Tamaibe, 33 and a lawyer with the Union of Women for Peace in Moundou.\n\nCultural differences also stem from religious differences, according to Moundou's Bishop Joachim Kouraleyo Tarounga\n\n\"The (financial) amount always disadvantages people from the south, in a conflict with someone from the north, whether they are the victim or culprit,\" Tamaibe said.\n\nConflicts between indigenous farmers and nomadic herders from the north cause deadly fighting in the south -- sparing neither women nor children on either side.\n\n\"After 1979, northern herders, the families of army officers, took up arms, killing and stealing entire herds,\" said Mbaindo Djasnabeye, member of the Chadian Association for Non-Violence in Moundou.\n\n- Economic tensions -\n\nTensions between the north and south are also economic. The south does not profit from its significant economic activities, including cotton and oil.\n\nIn the southern oil city Doba, for example, there is virtually no electricity and students learn outside at the foot of derricks.\n\nWhereas in Deby's desert home region, the northern Amdjarass city, electricity powers hundreds of uninhabited luxury villas.\n\n\"The economy is flourishing in the south, but mainly at the hands of northerners,\" said Golmadji Sanambaye, 50 and coordinator of the peace and reconciliation committee CSAPR.\n\n\"As a southerner, I am not oppressed by the north but by a regime,\" Sanambaye clarified.\n\n\"If a southerner wants to set up in transport or petrol stations, barriers are put in the way or they are forced to sell,\" added Djasnabeye.\n\nMuslims make up just over half of Chad's population, with Christians forming about 40 percent and animists 10 percent.\n\nBut other than northern urban centres, like 1.5 million-strong N'Djamena, the fertile south is the most densely populated.\n\n\"We have the same qualifications as those in the north, but it's impossible to get a job if we're not close to the government,\" said a 22-year-old University of Moundou student, who refused to give his name \"for fear of reprisals\" but will vote for Masra.\n\n\"The north-south divide could be exacerbated by the election results,\" feared Sali Bakari, a teacher and researcher at the Ecole Normale Superieure in N'Djamena.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But that alliance may be fraying, highlighting how politically salient anti-Western sentiment has become in the Sahel.\n\nChad's decision last month to ask the U.S. to withdraw its troops from an army base in the capital, N'djamena, shows how even a stalwart Western ally like Deby, running in an election he is guaranteed to win, was compelled to push back on Western presence, said Remadji Hoinathy, Central Africa analyst at the Dakar-based Institute for Security Studies.\n\n\"With anti-French sentiment on the rise, Deby wants to be seen as less dependent on the West by asking some U.S. troops to leave,\" Hoinathy said.\n\nChad is in the middle of a belt of countries that have suffered coups since 2020 that stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. French troops have been forced to leave neighboring Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso after their ruling juntas forged closer ties to Moscow.\n\nThis week the U.S. said it would temporarily withdraw its roughly 100 troops from Chad and hundreds from neighboring Niger after the military rulers there cut security agreements with the U.S. and invited Russian forces to deploy. Lloyd Austin, U.S. defense secretary, on Friday confirmed reports that Russian soldiers were now stationed at an airbase used by U.S. troops in Niger's capital, Niamey.\n\nThey \"are in a separate compound and don't have access to U.S. forces or access to our equipment,\" he told reporters in Honolulu.\n\nDeby's taken advantage of the emerging multipolar world order, reinforcing ties with Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Russia while maintaining relations with France and the U.S., at least for now, said Yamingu\u00e9 Betinbaye, a political analyst and research director at the Anthropology and Human Sciences Research Center in N'djamena.\n\n\"France is too strategic at the moment for Deby to cut ties, but he can at least show that Chad is a sovereign country that won't accept to be bullied into choosing sides or only working with some partners,\" Betinbaye said. Ex-colonial power France has roughly 1,000 soldiers stationed in the country.\n\nThe continued U.S. presence in Chad is still in limbo after it failed to reach an agreement for its troops to remain at a French army base.

He has been ramping up considerable support on the stump in recent weeks and is seen by southerners as their standard-bearer.\n\n\"Here, when we don't like something, we say so. It's the same between a chief and a simple citizen, we don't consider chiefs to be sacred, unlike in the north,\" said Moundou's Bishop Joachim Kouraleyo Tarounga.\n\nCultural differences also stem from religious differences, Tarounga said.\n\nNotably, so-called \"diya\" or blood money in Islamic law, where compensation is paid to families of homicide victims, is highly resented in the south.\n\n\"It comes from the north,\" said Sylver Tamaibe, 33 and a lawyer with the Union of Women for Peace in Moundou.\n\n\"The (financial) amount always disadvantages people from the south, in a conflict with someone from the north, whether they are the victim or culprit,\" Tamaibe said.\n\nConflicts between indigenous farmers and nomadic herders from the north cause deadly fighting in the south -- sparing neither women nor children on either side.\n\n\"After 1979, northern herders, the families of army officers, took up arms, killing and stealing entire herds,\" said Mbaindo Djasnabeye, member of the Chadian Association for Non-Violence in Moundou.\n\nEconomic tensions\n\nTensions between the north and south are also economic.

But by Monday afternoon, they were still unable to vote due to logistical problems, leaving many frustrated, according to the Reuters reporters.\n\n\"No one brought us a polling station or people to tell us where to vote,\" one said.\n\nAnalysts say President Mahamat Idriss Deby, who took over the day rebels killed his long-ruling father, Idriss Deby, in April 2021, is most likely to win, although his chief opponent drew larger-than-expected crowds on the campaign trail.\n\nMonday's election pitted Deby against his prime minister Succes Masra, previously a political opponent who fled into exile in 2022 but was allowed back a year later. Also running were former prime minister Albert Pahimi Padacke and seven other candidates.\n\nYaya Dillo, an opposition politician who had been expected to run against Deby despite coming from the same clan, was shot and killed in N'Djamena on Feb. 28, the day the election date was announced.\n\nSome opposition members and civil society groups had called for a boycott, citing concerns about possible vote-rigging.\n\nSome observers did not get their accreditations before the vote and were not given any reason for the refusal, Citizens' Alliance for Elections, a platform that monitors the poll, said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nDeby, who voted early on Monday in N'Djamena, has promised to bolster security, strengthen the rule of law and increase electricity production.\n\nSome 8.5 million people were registered to vote. Provisional results are expected by May 21 and final results by June 5.\n\nIf no candidate wins more than 50% of the votes, a run-off will be held on June 22.\n\nSecurity and the economy have been key campaign issues. Voters are also concerned about the high cost of living and access to water and electricity.\n\nAhaya Khalil, a voter in N'Djamena, said she was supporting Deby because he had promised to create jobs.\n\n\"We've come to vote for our president of the republic,\" she said. \"We hope he'll give our children jobs once he's elected.\"\n\nAnother voter, Mahamat Issa, said he was voting for \"peace, security and stability\" for the country.\n\n\"Also, the population suffers from the cost of living -- the future president must think about social issues,\" he added.\n\nThe vote coincides with a temporary withdrawal of U.S. troops from Chad, an important Western ally in a region of West and Central Africa courted by Russia and racked by jihadism.\n\nSince replacing his father at the helm of the oil-producing nation, Deby has remained close with former colonial power and longtime ally France.\n\nWhile other junta-ruled Sahel countries, including Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, have told Paris and other Western powers to withdraw and turned to Moscow for support, Chad remains the last Sahel state with a substantial French military presence.\n\nThe U.S., however, announced a temporary withdrawal of at least some troops last month following an order by Chad's air force chief that the U.S. halt activities at an air base.", "source": {"uri": "clubofmozambique.com", "dataType": "news",

The country has been through a lot,\" said Elia Torndoumbay, 37, an unemployed nurse voting in N'Djamena.\n\n\"I want this day to dawn and the sun to set so that justice and equality reign in my country.\"\n\nA 65-year-old man was shot dead after voting in the southern city of Moundou by an unknown attacker who did not have an electoral card and was barred from voting, electoral officials said.\n\n- Proclaimed by generals -\n\nMasra urged supporters to vote \"in massive numbers\" and for \"massive change\" after casting his ballot.\n\nSurrounded by armed presidential guards, Deby declared his \"commitment\" to a \"return to the constitutional order\" after voting.\n\nHe was proclaimed transitional president by 15 generals in 2021 after his father, Idriss Deby Itno, was killed in a gun battle with rebels following 30 years in power.\n\nMore from this section Russia-Ukraine War: Russian drones injure 6 in Ukraine's Kharkiv, Dnipro regions | Oneindia Student protests against Israel's offensive in Gaza spread Rainy weekend ahead for New Jersey\n\nKnown as MIDI for his initials and as \"the Man in Dark Glasses\", Mahamat promised an 18-month transition to democracy but then extended it by two years.\n\nOpposition figures have since fled, been silenced or joined forces with Deby, while the junta has eliminated any attempts by civil society to campaign against it.\n\nOn October 20, 2022, the army and police opened fire on demonstrators protesting the transition extension, including members of Masra's party, The Transformers.\n\nAt least 300 young people died according to international NGOs, or, according to the regime, about 50.\n\nDeby's cousin and chief election rival Yaya Dillo Djerou was shot point-blank in the head in an army assault on February 28, according to his party.\n\nMasra was among the opponents driven out of the country but later returned and was named prime minister in January.\n\n- Not 'free or democratic' -\n\nThe International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) has warned the election appears \"neither credible, free nor democratic\".\n\nThe International Crisis Group (ICG) also noted that \"a number of problems in the run-up to the balloting cast doubt on its credibility\".\n\nThese include measures allowing officials to publish only regional vote tallies rather than posting the results at individual polling stations -- making it impossible for observers to verify the count.\n\nAs for Masra, it said: \"A significant proportion of his constituency now considers him to have become a stooge of those in power.\"\n\nIf Masra wins the election, it could be the first peaceful handover of power in Chad, which underwent several coups even before Deby's father seized power in 1990.\n\nThe largely desert central African nation is ranked by the United Nations as the fourth least-developed country in the world.\n\nWith a third of the population aged between 10 and 24, many are voting for the first time.\n\nResults are expected on May 21 with a possible second round on June 22.\n\nlnf-gir/rlp-kjm/bp/rlp/bc", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"},

drought and spread of pests.\n\nFAO said the country's banana exports last year were unable to keep up with global market demand due to a shortfall in domestic output caused by the devastating spread of fusarium wilt tropical trace (TR4), a serious banana disease.\n\nLocal banana growers also suffered financial strains because of the \"substantial\" costs they incurred to prevent the spread of

They've been waiting for almost two years after all, the longest they've waited for any iPad since the iconic Apple tablet made its debut on January 27, 2010. Steve Jobs had called it magical and revolutionary. Fourteen years and multiple releases later, some of that magic has started to fizzle or at least that is what sales numbers seem to indicate. iPad sales were down 17 percent in the last quarter as per data shared by Apple itself. Some of it had to do with no new iPad launch since 2022 and so, it goes without saying that the May 7, 2024, Apple event -- which is called Let Loose -- will hold the key for future success.\n\nThe Let Loose event will be entirely focused on the iPad and iPad accessories as Apple tries -- one more time -- to tell you how the iPad could be your best laptop replacement. Only this time, it seems, it's packing the goods to make its words do the talking. The star of the event will reportedly be an all-new iPad Pro with Apple M4 silicon. There is the off chance that Apple may try and sell you some AI features, too, made possible on the iPad Pro 2024 courtesy the M4 chip which will also be making its global debut on May 7 at the Apple Let Loose 2024 event. If so, Apple will be flipping the script because usually these new chips tend to launch alongside a Mac or two. Anyhow, expect more details on AI, more precisely, generative AI and what the future holds for Apple in race to catch up with OpenAI/Microsoft, Google, and even Samsung, at WWDC 2024 on June 10.\n\nApple event 2024: Apple Let Loose iPad event on May 7 livestream details\n\nWhile not technically a \"live\" stream, Apple will stream a pre-recorded footage of the Let Loose iPad event from Apple Park in Cupertino, California on May 7, 2024. This will be similar to how it launched new Mac products with the M3 family of chips at the Scary Fast event in October 2023. The Apple event 2024 will kick-off at 7 am Pacific Time. In India, it translates to 7:30 pm. Reports say, the event will be a little more than half an hour in duration, so expect rapid-fast announcements.\n\nAs is usually the case with recent Apple events, the Let Loose iPad event on May 7 will be available to watch on Apple.com and the company's official YouTube channel (you can find the link down below).\n\nApple event 2024: What to expect at Apple Let Loose iPad event on May 7\n\nExpect the iPad Pro to get its biggest update in years. Beginning with the design, rumour has it that Apple is going for something sleeker (which should be useful as the rumoured Magic Keyboard update is expected to be chunkier with an aluminum build). The front-facing camera should be switching to a landscape orientation, too.\n\nThe screen size is expected to be carried over and so you're likely to get the iPad Pro 2024 in 11- and 12.9-inch sizes like before, but the panels will get the OLED treatment switching from mini-LED in the previous generation. The iPad Pro OLED switch is probably one of the most highly anticipated things to watch out for. As we mentioned before, these new iPad Pro models are also likely to get the M4 chip, which is yet to be officially announced. Previously, they were rumoured to come with the M3, which powers other Mac computers like the recently launched M3-based MacBook Air and 14-inch MacBook Pro.\n\nThe iPad Pro will be joined by the 2024 version of the iPad Air, another Apple iPad which has not been updated since 2022. Rumour has it that there will be an additional 12.9-inch version (alongside the usual 10.9-inch) available this time for people looking for a big-screen tablet on the cheap. These iPad Air 2024 models are expected to be powered by the M2 chip.\n\nJoining the iPad Pro and iPad Air updates will be a new Apple Pencil with haptic feedback and an upgraded Magic Keyboard folio accessory that will be better suited for wear and tear, come with a bigger trackpad, and just in general, have a better shot at making the iPad 2024 updates a more legible laptop replacement.", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fe_tech_desk@financialexpress.com", "name": "Fe Tech Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Page orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple-event-ipad1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-01-27", "textStart": 189, "textEnd": 205}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1206, "textEnd": 1211, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 1545, "textEnd": 1552}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

After an almost 18-month hiatus, Apple is finally set to release a major refresh to its iPad lineup on May 7, 2024, in an online event dubbed 'Let Loose.' Apple's Chief Executive Officer, Tim Cook, is reportedly set to lead the online presentation, which is expected to last around 30 minutes. The event is the first big event Apple is hosting this year and is anticipated to bring significant upgrades to the iPad Pro and iPad Air, along with potential updates to their accessories. Here is everything we expect from the Let Loose event happening tomorrow.\n\nThe biggest highlight of the event is said to be the introduction of OLED screens for the iPad Pro. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple will upgrade the screens of the iPad Pro to provide richer visuals with improved brightness, contrast, and colour accuracy, making the iPad Pro even more powerful for creative professionals and media enthusiasts.\n\nThe new iPad Pro models are also expected to be significantly thinner compared to their predecessors, with the 12.9-inch model potentially shrinking by 20% and the 11-inch model by 15%. This sleek design might be partially attributed to the adoption of OLED displays, but battery life remains a potential concern.\n\nRumours also suggest that Apple is set to debut its new generation faster M4 chip with the iPad Pro lineup, offering significant performance and efficiency improvements over the current M3 chip. This could further solidify the iPad Pro's position as a powerful productivity and creative powerhouse. However, for Macs, Apple is expected to refresh the lineup later in the year.\n\nSimilar to the base iPad, the iPad Pro is expected to relocate its front-facing camera to the landscape bezel. This change aims to provide a more natural and intuitive experience during video conferencing.\n\nApple might also unveil a redesigned Magic Keyboard specifically for the new iPad Pro models. This iteration could feature an aluminium base for a more laptop-like feel, a larger trackpad, and possibly even a row of function keys, further boosting productivity and usability.\n\nThe long-awaited third-generation Apple Pencil is also rumoured to debut tomorrow, featuring upgrades such as swappable tips, Find My integration, and a potential \"squeeze\" gesture for additional control options. This could cater to a wider range of creative needs and workflows.\n\nWith significant upgrades and potentially a new chip, price increases for the new iPad Pro models are also likely. Reports suggest that base prices could rise by at least $100, and when factoring in the potential need for a new Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil, the overall cost of a complete iPad Pro package might see a significant jump.\n\nWhile the iPad Pro takes centre stage with its OLED revolution, Apple is also expected to update the iPad Air lineup. The most notable addition will be a 12.9-inch iPad Air, marking the first time this larger size enters the Air category. However, this model is likely to retain the LCD display technology of previous Air models. Similar to the iPad Pro, the front-facing camera will be repositioned to the landscape bezel.\n\nDespite the upgrades, the redesigned Magic Keyboard will reportedly remain exclusive to the iPad Pro models, potentially maintaining a clear distinction between the two iPad tiers.\n\nApple might also announce the release date for iPadOS 17.5. While major feature additions might be limited, expect information on Find My security enhancements and the potential addition of new games and apps. However, a more comprehensive OS update, potentially iPadOS 18, alongside iOS 18 and other updates, might be unveiled at Apple's WWDC event scheduled for a month later.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_key", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Function key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/3D_Modelling", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/3D Modelling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/ipad-air-295440208-16x9.jpg?VersionId=cu31UTQnT_OaMXFtc_Mrq3qbxHU4PO_o", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

The May 7 virtual event, titled \"Let Loose,\" will hopefully try to convince existing and new users to upgrade to new iPads and accessories, a task that has become harder as the years have gone on. This is the first time in many years Cupertino is holding a dedicated iPad event, and the expectations are already high. But it's unusual for Apple to host an event mere days ahead of its annual WWDC. Will Apple only focus on the iPad's hardware, or might we also see updated software during Tuesday's event? Here's everything Apple could possibly announce during its highly-anticipated iPad event.\n\nThe high-end iPad Pro is likely to hog the limelight, and for the right reasons. Apple has spent years pitching the iPad Pro as a laptop replacement, and with the right mix of accessories, the tablet feels like a hybrid between a tablet and a Mac. For this year, the new iPad Pros will undergo a significant redesign for both 11-inch and 12.9-inch sizes. Both are rumoured to get OLED displays, a huge step up from the LCD display (the 12.9-inch iPad Pro previously featured a MiniLED display). The tablets are expected to receive a new chassis design, making them a bit thinner and lighter. Other changes also include a landscape-oriented camera on the tablet's front.\n\nHowever, the biggest change coming to the iPad Pro is the AI-ready chip, which might unlock AI features in the future. The M3 chip that's already there in the new MacBooks is the logical processor Apple may go with. However, some reports have suggested that Apple will introduce the M4 at this event, with the iPad Pro becoming the first device to use Apple's cutting-edge processor. Nothing much is known about what the M4 might bring to the market, but given how Apple is teasing its AI efforts at WWDC early next month, the new chip could lay the groundwork for Generative AI. This move, if Apple launches the M4 chip, is more to compete with Microsoft's upcoming event where it is likely to launch the new Surface 2-in-1s with Qualcomm's new AI chips, with a special focus on the hardware and changes to Windows.\n\niPad Air could come in two screen sizes\n\nAlongside the iPad Pro, Cupertino could also introduce new iPad Air models. However, for the first time, Apple could launch the mid-ranger in two different screen sizes. This will make the iPad Air (if rumours of a 12.9-inch screen size turn true) even closer to the iPad Pro. Just don't expect the new iPad Air to get the M3 chip or OLED screen.\n\nSpecial emphasis on accessories\n\nFurther, Apple is expected to introduce a new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro as well as the Apple Pencil 3. Accessories add a new layer to the iPad, making the device not only more flexible but also adding a key differentiator to a traditional laptop form factor. The new Magic Keyboard will apparently be made of aluminum and will have a bigger trackpad. The new Pencil, meanwhile, will have swappable tips as well as haptic feedback for the first time.\n\nWhat about the new software experience?\n\nHowever, insiders believe that more than the updated hardware, Apple needs to reboot the software experience on the iPad. Though Tuesday's event might only focus on the iPad's hardware, with Apple showcasing what's new coming to the iPadOS at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in early June. But Apple could surprise users by adding new features to the upcoming iPadOS 17.5 update, which could be rolled out when new iPads go on sale.\n\nIs Apple done with budget iPads?\n\nProbably not. Despite the messy iPad lineup, Cupertino won't give up on budget iPads just yet, and it shouldn't. Apple needs entry-level iPads to fend off competition from Chromebooks and budget tablets from the likes of Samsung, Lenovo, and OnePlus. A budget iPad is not only critical to grabbing market share but also helps increase its footprint in the education market. Although there are rumours of Apple getting rid of the 9th generation iPad, it might not happen soon. Apple will continue to sell the budget tablet while also selling the 10th generation model. Apple is working on an iPad mini 7 featuring a faster processor. However, it likely won't launch alongside the iPad Pro and iPad Air. Expect Apple to focus on entry-level iPads later this year.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anuj_bhatia@indianexpress.com", "name": "Anuj Bhatia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Mini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Mini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chromebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/apple-ipad-pro-magic-keyboard.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 99, "textEnd": 104}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

New accessories, including the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil, are also expected at the event.\n\nAfter an 18-month hiatus, Apple is finally going to update its iPad lineup -- the longest break since the late Steve Jobs debuted the product in 2010.\n\nThe May 7 event, dubbed \"Let Loose\", will reportedly be 35 minutes long and strictly online. In India, the livestream will start at 7.30 pm and can be accessed through Apple's official website and its YouTube channel.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, this time Apple is looking to primarily refresh the iPad Pro and the iPad Air with major updates. New accessories, including the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil, are also expected at the event.\n\nHere is everything you can expect on May 7\n\niPad Pro: The star of the show is the new iPad Pro, featuring an updated design and an OLED display, a first for the iPad lineup. The introduction of OLED not only makes the display crisper but also allows for a sleeker device design. Both the 10-inch and the 12.9-inch models are expected to be updated and, rumours suggest that they will be powered by Apple's first AI-enabled M4 chips. Those chips will help power artificial intelligence tasks -- part of a broader push into AI that Apple will explain further in June.\n\niPad Air: Apple is also set to unveil an updated iPad Air, introducing a larger 12.9-inch option, aligning it with the size of the iPad Pro. This move provides consumers with a more affordable entry point to the large-screen tablet experience. Both the new 12.9-inch and existing 10.9-inch models are expected to boast 2022's M2 chip.\n\nUpgraded Accessories: The event will also showcase refreshed accessories, including the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard. The redesigned Apple Pencil is speculated to feature haptic feedback and enhanced functionality, while the updated Magic Keyboard aims for increased durability with an aluminium build and a more laptop-like appearance.\n\nWhile these announcements are sure to generate excitement, some developments are slated for a later date:\n\nFuture Releases: Apple is rumoured to be working on a cost-reduced version of its 10th-generation iPad, expected to debut towards the end of the year. Additionally, new AI capabilities for the iPad Pro could be teased on Tuesday but nothing can be expected before the iPadOS 18 in unveiled at WWDC in June. The iPad mini could also get an update later this year\n\nBeyond iPads: While the iPad Pro may introduce the M4 chip, new Macs are not slated for release until later in 2024. Similarly, revamped low-end AirPods are on the horizon but will most likely be launched alongside new iPhones in the fall.\n\nAlso Read: Apple sales fall but surpass estimates, guides for low single digit sales in Q3", "source": {"uri": "cnbctv18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "cnbctv18.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pihu_yadav@cnbctv18.com", "name": "Pihu Yadav", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPods", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AirPods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Mini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Mini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2024/05/ipad-2024-05-3cbc1014682e9f3bb4310c54680f8375.jpeg?im=FitAndFill,width=500,height=300", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 389, "textEnd": 394, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

It has been widely tipped to be the event where we finally get to see the new iPad Pro 2024 and the iPad Air 2024 models, along with some more devices.\n\nEarlier it was said that Apple is unlikely to have an event to launch iPads but those rumours can be put to rest. The May 7 event is getting a different telecast time which suggests the company is eyeing a different viewership, unlike the iPhone launch event which starts later in the evening.\n\nFor the longest time, rumours hinted that Apple will power the iPad Pro 2024 with M3 chipset and the iPad Air upgraded from M1 to M2 this year. Now, reports have sprung a big surprise, which will even have a dose of AI for future iPad buyers.\n\nApple is basically ready to push the M4 processors on the new iPads, which comes with a built-in neural engine that gives you the AI push on the slates. The report doesn't tell us if the M4 boost will be offered on the iPad Pro and Air or just the Pro model. The iPad Air is generally placed lower in the lineup so it is possible that Apple gives it the M3 instead, which is not a bad deal at all.\n\nThese two iPad models could be lining up along with a new version of the Apple Pencil and a new-look Magic Keyboard that will look to build on the functionality of the 12.9-inch iPad models and pair it with iPadOS for the best results. The Apple Pencil 3 will have new haptic feedback and gesture support which could really push the use case of the Apple stylus, not only on the Pro but the Air model as well.\n\nUpgrading the iPad Pro with an OLED display could really push its price this year, which doesn't much for the model which is already priced in the high-end. Having a new 12.9-inch iPad Air will also help Apple to push the starting range of the new models, but we are hoping the price of the M1 iPad Air comes down which allows more people to upgrade rather than spending on the new, pricier 2024 iPad models.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple M1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stylus (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/3D_Modelling", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/3D Modelling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/03/ipad-air-and-pro-2024-round-up-2024-03-3ccb6c5e4ef47d077278395b077e55d0-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 200, "textEnd": 205, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

While the iPad Pro models with an OLED display will be the highlight of the event, the company will have additional products in store with some pretty major gains. If you are not familiar, we have curated a list of products that you should be looking forward to on May 7.\n\nOn various occasions, we have reported that Apple failed to release a new iPad last year, and the company's decision was reflected in its annual revenue. However, it was reported that the company will upgrade its entire product line this year, with the iPad Pro and iPad Air being the first ones in the mix. If you are anxiously waiting for Apple's 'Let Loose' event on May 7, Apple will announce these devices to the general public.\n\nNew iPad Pro With OLED\n\nThe new iPad Pro models will come in two sizes and both of them will house an OLED panel, ending display discrimination between the two variants. The new display is possibly the most exciting part of the upgrade as the OLED panel is slated to be the 'best' panel on a tablet with deeper blacks, higher contrast rations, and better power efficiency. It will also boast 120Hz ProMotion technology.\n\nThe iPad Pro will also come with a redesigned chassis and possibly a glass back with MagSafe charging capabilities. We are not familiar with the precise design details but based on recent reports, the OLED iPad Pro could come with slimmer bezels and Face ID in the landscape position. The tablet is also speculated to be a lot thinner than the current models, but the exact dimensions are not known at this point.\n\nLastly, based on recent and rather strange reports, the OLED iPad Pro will skip the M3 chip and jump directly to the M4 version. The chip will be designed specifically for AI features, which will be coming to the iPad later this year. However, the company could hint at some of the AI capabilities on Tuesday. There is no word what kind of performance gains we should be looking forward to but considering it will be based on TSMC's 3nm process, the M4 chip will deliver enhanced computational and graphical performance.\n\n12.9-Inch iPad Air\n\nApple will potentially release two models of the iPad Air this year. In terms of design, both models will look identical to the current model, but with some slight variations. For instance, the Face ID sensors and front camera will move to the landscape orientation instead of being on the top.\n\nAs for the display, the iPad Air will continue to house LCD panels, despite a brief report on the 12.9-inch model getting a mini-LED upgrade. Later on, the rumors were put to rest by the same source. However, the company could fine-tune the display for better contrast ratio and color accuracy. Other than this, the iPad Air will feature the same design.\n\nInternally, the device will be powered by the M2 chip, which will be a significant upgrade for the iPad Air lineup. The company is aiming to keep the new processors for the 'Pro' models. The devices will also gain support for new accessories that will be announced at the event.\n\nNew Apple Pencil\n\nApple will unveil a new Apple Pencil accessory, specifically designed for the new OLED iPad Pro. The accessory is reported to come with two options for better control. It was discovered in iOS 17.5 beta that the forthcoming Apple Pencil will come with a \"squeeze\" gesture and support for haptic feedback. Each aspect will allow users to activate different features and switch between them easily.\n\nNew Magic Keyboard\n\nApple will revamp the Magic Keyboard to fit the new dimensions of the iPad Pro and Air models. Additionally, the Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro will also come with significant changes with varying hinge levels.\n\nVision Pro Support\n\nApple could expand the Vision Pro to more countries at its Let Loose event. The demand for the headset has been stagnant for a while, and it makes sense for Apple to offer the headset in more regions like the UK, China, Canada, and other countries.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nApple could also release new Apple Watch bands, iPhone cases, and iPad cases as part of its Spring update. However, we are not familiar if the company will launch the iPhone 15 lineup in new color options. Furthermore, Apple could also release new software updates for the iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch, iPad, and Vision Pro.

The iPad Pro (2024) series may see a price increase attributed to its hardware enhancements.\n\niPad Pro (2024): Specifications (Expected)\n\nAs per a Bloomberg report, the forthcoming iPad models are set to be the first in the lineup to feature OLED screens, renowned for their superior colour accuracy, contrast levels, and brightness compared to the current mini LED displays.\n\nAs per the report, sources suggest that Apple is in talks with display suppliers such as Samsung and LG to procure OLED panels for the 2024 iPad Pro series. The adoption of OLED technology is expected to result in a thinner and potentially lighter design for the new iPad Pro models, thanks to internal structural refinements. A report from 9to5Mac further hints at a potential 20 per cent reduction in thickness compared to the previous models.\n\nPreviously, reports indicated that the 2024 iPad Pro lineup would be powered by the M3 chip, akin to the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. However, a recent update from Bloomberg suggests the possibility of Apple opting for the M4 chip, likely to rival upcoming Qualcomm-powered Windows laptops.\n\nEven with the M3 chip, Apple has positioned the new MacBooks as capable gaming devices.\n\nBloomberg's insights suggest that the M4-powered iPad Pro is envisioned as an AI-capable tablet. However, the full realisation of these AI capabilities may require the iPadOS 18 update, slated for WWDC 2024. Similar to current models, the upcoming iPads are expected to offer various storage options ranging from 128 GB to 2 TB, along with choices for both Wi-Fi and cellular models supporting 5G and Wi-Fi 6E networks.\n\niPad Pro (2024): Coming In Two Sizes (Expected)\n\nApple has maintained a tradition of offering the iPad Pro series in dual sizes since its inception, a pattern expected to persist with the upcoming release. Renowned analyst Ming-Chi Kuo foresees the inclusion of both an 11-inch model and a larger 12.9-inch variant in the iPad Pro lineup.\n\nMoreover, rumours are circulating about the potential introduction of a larger 14-inch model, which could potentially replace the traditional 12.9-inch size. This change could serve to differentiate between the iPad Pro and iPad Air series. While this modification may not materialise this year, it remains a plausible scenario for the subsequent year.\n\niPad Pro (2024): Will Launch Alongside New Apple Pencil, New Magic Keyboard (Expected)\n\nApple has recently launched a new Pencil with USB-C compatibility, targeting entry-level models. However, there are reports indicating that the company is gearing up to introduce a third-generation Pencil specifically designed for use with the iPad Pro, set to be unveiled during the upcoming 'Let Loose' event.\n\nApart from the new Pencil, Apple is rumoured to unveil an upgraded Magic Keyboard that, when paired with the iPad Pro, seeks to emulate a laptop-like experience. This improved Magic Keyboard is anticipated to come with a larger trackpad, enhanced keys, and a metallic finish, all aimed at offering users a more laptop-oriented functionality.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED-backlit_LCD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LED-backlit LCD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_6", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi 6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/05/06/9fbfd2704d48a7302855cd517c14dd311714977019643555_original.png?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 119, "textEnd": 124, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

And we have all the details you need to know.\n\nFirst up is the iPad Pro 2024, which is expected to come in 11-inch and 12.9 sizes once more but get an upgrade to more vivid OLED displays. Just as important, these will likely be the first Apple devices to sport the company's powerful M4 chip.\n\nThis chip will apparently help Apple offer new AI capabilities while also blurring the lines between the best MacBooks and the best iPads. In addition, Gurman claims that the new Magic Keyboard will come in a sturdier aluminum design and 'laptop-like aesthetic.'\n\nAnd while the new iPadOS 18 isn't slated to debut until WWDC 2024 in June, the report also says there will be new software to take advantage of the hardware. This could include improved multitasking, as well as new capabilities for the rumored Apple Pencil 3. We've heard that the Apple Pencil 3 could support haptic feedback along with new squeeze gestures.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple is reportedly about to unleash the biggest iPad Air ever, releasing both a 11-inch iPad Air 2024 and a 12.9-inch model. The larger iPad Air could wind up being a valid alternative to the iPad Pro 2024 for those who are willing to live with less power.\n\nHow much power are we talking? Both new iPad Airs are tipped to feature the older M2 chip. But given that the M2 powered the iPad Pro 2022 models, we don't think these slates are going to feel slow. You'll likely notice a difference only when doing heavy multitasking or doing heavy-duty tasks like video editing or gaming.\n\nWe're hoping the new iPad Airs will support the new Apple Pencil 3, but it's possible the accessory could be an exclusive to the Pro lineup. And while you won't see OLED on these Airs, it's possible that these tablets could get high-quality mini-LED panels.\n\nGiven that Apple hasn't released a new iPad since 2022, it's not that surprising that iPad revenue has been declining. According to the most recent second-quarter Apple earnings, CNBC reported that iPad revenue was $5.6 billion vs. an estimated $5.9 billion. That's a drop of 17%.\n\nSo it's clear that there's a lot riding on the new iPad launch.

And any possible doubt that the upcoming 'Let Loose' event could be something unrelated has been put to bed with the event invite featuring an Apple Pencil in hand.\n\nWe'll have full coverage of everything announced as it happens here, but if you want to hear it straight from Tim Cook's mouth, here's how to watch Apple's May iPad event online.\n\nThe May iPad event is coming via a scheduled video stream, and it'll take place on Tuesday May 7. It kicks off at 7am PT, 10am ET or 3pm BST.\n\nIf you're planning to watch from Australia, it just tips into Wednesday morning, starting at 12am AEST.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the stream will run to around 35 minutes -- similar to October's \"Spooky Fast\" event.\n\nAs you're already here, the easiest way to watch the event is in the YouTube embed above. When the event kicks off, you'll be able to press play and watch the iPads being unveiled in real time.\n\nAlternatively, you can watch on YouTube directly, on the Apple website or on the Apple TV app on your phone. Finally, if you have an Apple TV device, perhaps the most luxurious way to watch is on the big screen via the TV app.\n\nWhile Apple is said to be working on refreshes of all four iPads, this specific event is only likely to cover two of them: the Air and the Pro. The iPad mini 7 and iPad 11 are set for later in the year, according to the analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\n\nBoth tablets are set to have substantial changes. The iPad Air will get a whole new form factor, with Apple preparing to offer a 12.9-inch option alongside the much loved 10.9-inch version. It's expected to pack an M2 chip, giving it MacBook style power.\n\nThat sounds a lot like Apple narrowing the gap between Air and Pro - except the 2024 iPad Pro is about to up the ante significantly.\n\nIn addition to possibly getting the new M4 chip, the upcoming iPad Pro is set to feature OLED panels for the first time. In short, that represents a big uplift in screen quality over the mini-LED panels in the last versions, with perfect blacks and infinite contrast (with OLED, each pixel is self illuminating, meaning that black areas are the absence of light).\n\nThere's also talk of the new iPad Pro getting a new, improved Magic Keyboard and possibly an enhanced Apple Pencil too. The former is set to blur the line between MacBook and iPad further with an aluminium build and large trackpad, while the latter could bring greater sensitivity, extra gestures and possible Vision Pro compatibility.\n\nAll in all, it should be a very exciting event indeed. But again, if you can't watch live, we'll have full coverage here with our Apple Event live blog and a recap to get you fully caught up.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Mini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Mini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pixel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sDbCcu2auyHG5xgz4g4sQB-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 865, "textEnd": 870}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

What To Expect?", "body": "All eyes will be on the Apple iPads when the brand will hold its Let Loose event on May 7 at 7am Pacific Time (7.30pm India Time). Apple CEO Tim Cook could announce new iPad Air and Pro models as well as upgrades to the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard during the event. While the Let Loose event will be focussed on announcements on the new iPads, the Worldwide Developer Conference scheduled for next month will involve the unveiling of new software updates for iPads, Macs, iPhones, and more. Here's what to expect from Apple's upcoming event:\n\nThe iPad Air is expected to feature a larger display, which was previously limited to the Pro lineup. According to reports, the new iPad Air range could arrive in two sizes: 12.9-inch and 10.9-inch. However, don't expect major changes to the display technology as the iPad Air lineup could retain the same LCD display found in the previous iterations. Furthermore, an OLED panel could replace the mini-LED display in the existing iPad Pro lineup.\n\nAs for the processor, the iPad Air is expected to receive an upgrade from the existing generation and could arrive with Apple's M2 chipset. Apple will also be unveiling the Magic Keyboard and 3rd generation Apple Pencil during the event. However, it is not yet known whether these will be offered with the iPad Air range or Pro models.\n\nALSO READ: Apple Could Launch iPhone 16 Without Physical Buttons, Claims New Leak\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gurnman has recently reported that the iPad Pro lineup could receive an upgrade and feature the OLED display technology, found in iPhones since 2017. The OLED display will reduce bezels and provide better image quality, resulting in a thinner tablet.\n\nWhile the iPad Pro's 12.9-inch model could be around 20 per cent slimmer, the 11-inch variant is expected to be 15 per cent thinner as compared to its predecessor.\n\nIn a first, Apple is expected to introduce the M4 chipset for the iPad Pro lineup, Gurnman's latest report suggests. The M4 chipset could assist in some heavy-duty artificial intelligence tasks of the tablet. However, Apple will explain this in detail during the WWDC event in June.\n\nIn a disappointment to customers, Apple could also increase the prices of the iPad Pro range, according to a 9to5Mac report. It suggests that the cost of Apple's premium tablets could go up by $100.\n\nApple is expected to unveil the new iteration of the Magic Keyboard and 3rd generation Apple Pencil during the Let Loose event on Tuesday.\n\nGurnman revealed that one of the key highlights of the event will be the 3rd generation Apple Pencil.

The event is much earlier than usual for Apple, with the announcement happening at 7 AM PT or 10 AM ET. Typically, Apple always has launch events at 10 AM PT. So those on the West Coast can wake up and see the shiny new iPads.\n\nWith this event, you can watch Apple announce the new iPads online through YouTube or Apple's own website. According to recent rumors, this event is set for about 35 minutes runtime. This is pretty short for Apple, but we've also heard from Mark Gurman that this event will only be about the new iPads and accessories. And do not expect some sort of spring iPhone color or new Macs.\n\nSo what is Apple announcing at its 'Let Loose' event on Tuesday? Well, we expect all-new iPad Pro models as well as a refresh for the iPad Air. The new iPad Pro's expected to come with OLED and be a tiny bit larger, about 0.1 inches larger, with around 15% thinner bezels. Which means they should be about the same size as the current iPad Pro models. Additionally, they are getting thinner, around 5mm.\n\nThe iPad Air is getting a smaller update, but it is going to be getting a second size. iPad Air will come in 11- and 12.9-inch sizes. It'll also stick with M2 chipsets, while the Pro models will jump to M4. This seems a little odd, given the fact that the M3 debuted last October in new Macs.\n\nApple is also planning to finish cleaning up its iPad lineup by next year. That includes getting rid of the ninth-generation iPad, replacing it with a cheaper 10.9-inch model, and the iPad Mini will get updated with a faster chip.

The event, set to commence at 7:30 pm (IST), will be streamed live on Apple's website, allowing a global audience to witness the unveiling of these new products. Now, the event is largely expected to see the launch of two new iPad models and some accessories as well.\n\nIt should be kept in mind that this will be a mini event, rumoured to last only 35 minutes (much shorter when compared to the Cupertino giant's usual hour-long affairs). So, it could be speculated that there won't be too many new launches at the event.\n\nHere's everything we expect to see at Apple's 'Let Loose' event:\n\niPad Air: Everything We Expect To See\n\nAmong the anticipated announcements is the next-generation iPad Air, rumoured to come in a new 12.9-inch display variant in addition to the standard 10.9-inch model.\n\nWhile maintaining the design framework of its predecessor, the 2024 iPad Air might feature a redesigned rear camera module akin to that of the Pro model. It is speculated to be powered by the M2 chip, with possibilities of the larger 12.9-inch model being equipped with the M3 chip.\n\nMoreover, enhancements such as Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 support are anticipated for improved connectivity.\n\nThe highlight of the event is expected to be the next-generation iPad Pro, touted to introduce groundbreaking hardware upgrades, including an OLED display. This move marks a significant departure from previous models and is poised to offer variable refresh rates, potentially as low as 10Hz.\n\nAvailable in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes, the Pro models are anticipated to feature slimmer bezels, enhancing the overall viewing experience. Moreover, the introduction of the Apple M4 chip is set to propel the iPad Pro 2024 as the company's first AI-powered device, featuring a redesigned camera module and landscape-oriented front camera.\n\nALSO READ: From Price To Specs, Everything We Know So Far On The Upcoming iPad Pro\n\nApple Accessories Expected: New Apple Pencil, More\n\nIn addition to the iPad lineup, Apple is expected to unveil new accessories, including updates to its pencil range and a revamped Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro 2024. Reports suggest that the new Magic Keyboard will boast enhanced durability and a larger trackpad, resembling a laptop-like aesthetic.\n\nApple AI On The Plate As Well?\n\nDuring a recent quarterly earnings call, Apple's CEO Tim Cook hinted at the company's ongoing investments in generative AI.

Apple's been coy as to which iPads are getting a refresh, but rumors and reports indicate a new OLED iPad Pro and an updated iPad Air.\n\nThe rumored iPad Pro may even skip the M3 chipset, as Bloomberg's Mark Gurman suggested there is a \"strong possibility\" that the tablet could feature the next-gen M4.

That means a glorious display that should bring richer colors and deeper blacks to the line. OLED panels are also thinner than LCD panels, so this could be one slender gadget. There are also rumors that the iPad Pro will feature a glass back .\n\nIt's been two whole years since an iPad Air refresh, which is a lifetime in tech years. The updated iPad Air will likely not have a fancy next-gen chipset or an OLED display. It could, however, boast an upgrade to the M2 chip. The current models still sport the antiquated M1. Reports also suggest that the iPad Air's front-facing camera is moving to the landscape edge.\n\nIt's also possible that the tablet has been bulking up on creatine, as rumors suggest that Apple is prepping the first 12.9-inch iPad Air. This would make it the most budget-friendly option for a large-screen iPad tablet.\n\nThe event won't just be for iPads. It'll also be for iPad accessories.

Will they succeed this year?", "body": "The new iPad Air is expected to feature the M2 chip, while the iPad Pro will likely boast a powerful new M4 chip made specifically to handle Apple's evolving artificial intelligence features. Image Credit: Apple\n\nFor years now, Apple has been trying to position the iPad as the perfect device that could replace the need for a laptop or a desktop in day-to-day use. Ever since Steve Jobs released the first iPad back in 2010, he has wanted people to turn to their Macs and desktops only for very heavy tasks.\n\nHowever, for all these years, Apple's efforts to set the iPad experience as something that would be good enough to replace laptops such as the MacBook Air or even the MacBook Pro has been only been incremental, Perhaps that is why, they fall short of fully realising what Jobs had iPad would eventually become.\n\nThe introduction of the iPad Pro in 2015 marked a significant step towards productivity with iPads, thanks to its larger screens and an attachable keyboard case.\n\nAfter that, all iterations of the iPad only came with minor updates and improvements to the keyboard case, that is until 2020 when Apple released the Magic Keyboard with a trackpad. However, users still found themselves reliant on traditional laptops for most tasks, simply because, the experience wasn't good enough.\n\nOver the years, Apple has introduced several apps and features that would take the iPad close to a MacBook. Stage Manager, for example, was a great feature that allowed users to organise their application windows. It truly was a game-changer for people who could adapt to it. Unfortunately for Apple, a lot of Apple customers did not fall under that category. The feature's complexity made it unintuitive, something that is regarded as a cardinal sin in Cupertino.\n\nThis ultimately prompted Apple to make adjustments that delayed its rollout, but even with the delay, the performance that the iPad could deliver was hardly comparable with one of Apple's own MacBooks.\n\nIn a strategic move to improve the iPad's performance, Apple equipped it with Mac-level chips, most notably the M1 processor in the iPad Pro in 2021. Now, we finally had some sort of a level playing field.\n\nWhile technically speaking, the first M1s in the first iPads were more of an upgraded version of Apple's mobile, for-iPhone and iPad chip, Apple's marketing team, geniuses as they are, managed to emphasise on Mac capabilities which resonated with consumers and developers alike.\n\nWith the launch of the 2024 series of the iPad, Apple faces a rather critical decision regarding the future of the iPad. should it remain a halfway solution to laptops or evolve into a genuine computing replacement?\n\nThe solution lies in committing to equipping the iPad with the capabilities of a laptop while retaining the form factor preferred by tablet users. The Mac should cater to those who prefer traditional computing, while the iPad should appeal to users who want touchscreen functionality. Moreover, because the MacBooks don't have touch functionality, it is unlikely to cannibalise the iPad as it will be a completely different product category.\n\nIn the evolving landscape, as it stands today, the line between Macs and iPads may blur further with Apple's efforts to introduce touch screens to Mac devices. This development will redefine the choice between an all-in-one device (laptop) and a modular system (iPad + accessories).\n\nAs Apple prepares for its \"Let Loose\" launch event, it has a unique opportunity to usher in a new era for the iPad. The presentation, which, reports suggest will last about 35 minutes, presents a chance to streamline iPad's lineup.\n\nApple appears set to align its high-end iPad range more closely with its Mac counterparts, signalling a significant shift in the company's product strategy.\n\nFurthermore, the new iPad Air is expected to feature the M2 chip, while the iPad Pro will likely boast a powerful new M4 chip made specifically to handle Apple's evolving artificial intelligence features.\n\nSimilar to the MacBook lineup, these changes should ensure that the performance capabilities of the Pro and Air models are clearly distinguished.\n\nApple also aims to streamline its iPad lineup further. The ninth-generation iPad will be phased out, making way for a more affordable 10.9-inch model. Additionally, the iPad mini should receive a boost with a faster chip.\n\nAs for replacing the MacBooks, the improvements Apple brings to top-end iPads will certainly bring them closer to traditional notebooks. Whether or not they translate into a device that is worthy enough to replace the MacBook will depend on accessibility features and accessories. Support for a Bluetooth mouse that functions and behaves like a mouse, for example, would go a long way.

One is that the iPad Air and Pro models are due for an upgrade. Both products were last updated in March and October 2022, respectively. More importantly, if you look at the Let Loose logo for the event, you will notice an artistic Apple logo featuring a hand holding an Apple Pencil, the stylus compatible with iPads.\n\nAside from the obvious spec bumps, rumors suggest the sixth-generation iPad Air will be the first in its lineup to introduce two sizes similar to the iPad Pro. In contrast, Apple's flagship tablet, the iPad Pro, is rumored to include an OLED display.\n\nBoth devices will undoubtedly get Apple silicon, but it remains a toss-up as to which. The iPad Air will likely get the M2 chip as its current model received the M1 chip, while the iPad Pro could follow the order of its previous two generations and receive the M3 processor.\n\nSome speculate that Apple may also announce the M4 chip. If that is the case, it will mark the first time an M-series chip has debuted on an iPad before a Mac computer. However, if the M4 chip is revealed, Apple will likely make it exclusive for the iPad Pro until it announces new Macs (possibly something the company will announce at WWDC next month).\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gruman further reported that the iPad Air will get M2 chips, while the iPad Pro models will get the M4 chips. The latter, in particular, is rumored to \"feel more like computers,\" according to Gurman. This feels like a direction the company has been taking with at least the flagship tablet for the last several years, from the release of accessories like the Magic Keyboard to adding the M-series to the products.\n\nRegarding accessories, the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil will likely get an update. In a separate report published last year, Gurman wrote that the Magic Keyboard would get a serious revamp, noting the accessory would \"make the iPad Pro look even more like a laptop than the current setup\" along with a larger trackpad.\n\nAs for the Apple Pencil, previous rumors have suggested that the event will unveil a third-generation Apple Pencil. Apple updated the accessory last November, adding USB-C support. However, it serves more as a low-end model due to its $79 price tag, lack of support for features like pressure sensitivity, and no wireless pairing or charging support.\n\nThere is a possibility that Apple may release a \"Pro\" variant of the stylus as MacRumors reported on May 6 that Apple's website in Japan mentioned the \"Apple Pencil Pro\" when describing the GIF for the Let Loose event. Regardless of what the new Apple Pencil is officially named, the new stylus is rumored to include interchangeable magnetic tips and a squeeze gesture.\n\nWhatever the case, keep an eye on IGN for a complete rundown of everything announced at Apple's Let Loose Event.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple M1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stylus (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacRumors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacRumors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping/Gifts", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping/Gifts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/06/apple-let-loose-1715019769261.png?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2977, "textEnd": 2982}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Against all odds, Apple announced a new event that will be broadcast online tomorrow Tuesday May 7. It will start at 4:00 p.m. (Spanish peninsular time). It is not expected to be very long, although it is very intense.\n\nAll the signs and even the logo of the event itself They clearly point to the iPad range and its accessories. And the Cupertino company has gone almost 600 days without launching a new tablet. Tomorrow, finally, there will be four new models divided into two ranges. Two of the highest, too.\n\nIt will already be the sixth generation that we see of this range. As standard we would expect a single iPad Air 6 as has been happening in recent years. However, on this occasion we will bet on two different sizes which, in turn, will be similar to those we have been seeing for some time in the iPad Pro range.\n\nWe will see 10.9-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Air. The first of them is the size that this series has had since the iPad Air 4, while the other will equal the size of the larger iPad Pro. The idea is to make that size more affordable without having to shell out the approximately 1,500 euros that this 'Pro' range costs.\n\nRegarding screen, LCD-IPS panels expected like those that are already traditional in the range, also limited to 60 Hz. In design they will also be similar to their predecessors, except for small details such as moving the front camera to the side bezel instead of the top, taking into account that most of the time In use, the device is being used horizontally.\n\nAn M2 chip will wait inside. Unlike the iPad Pro 2024 which could make the jump to the M4 by omitting the M3, no surprises are expected with these 'Air'. It is also no longer new that they integrate a Mac processor, given that the iPad Air 5 already did the same with the M1. Where perhaps we do expect more surprises, not yet confirmed, is in the storage. Currently the range offers 64 and 256 GB versions and it is not unreasonable to imagine that they will finally make the leap to 128 and 512 GB.\n\nUnlike the 'Air' range, this year's iPad Pro will not have any surprises in terms of size, as they will once again rely on two 11 and 12.9 inch versions. Maybe 13 if they reduce the bezels on the largest one, although in any case it would be a practically negligible difference.\n\nThe great news will be that both will have OLED panels. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2020 already debuted with an excellent Mini-LED that was also seen on the iPad Pro 2022. However, the small model had remained with the IPS-LCD. Now the two will make the leap to this technology even better than the previous ones and maintaining their high refresh rate at 120 Hz.\n\nlike brain There are still doubts between the M3 and the M4. It is the M3 that we were all waiting for, and it is also common as it is the last Apple chip presented. However, a recent report from Bloomberg suggested that we would see the still unreleased M4 chip with a larger and better neural engine aimed at artificial intelligence that could also be talked about at the event (although the highlight would continue to be WWDC 2024 of the June 10th).\n\nIt is also expected a slight redesign of which it is still not known for sure what it will cover, since the leaked renders do not end up showing it in a defined way. It is known that, as in the iPad Air, the front camera will move to the side bezel to facilitate its use with the device horizontally.\n\nIf the tablets are the big stars of the event, the participation of the two invited artists will not be negligible. On the one hand, the long-awaited Apple Pencil 3, which will mean the definitive generation of the iPad stylus. Among its leaked specifications, several new features emerge that sound very interesting.\n\nOn the one hand, the magnetic and interchangeable tips that will allow different layouts to be obtained, in conjunction with haptic vibrations that accompany it to give a greater sensation of drawing on paper. They are also expected new gestures with whom to exchange between their functions. Of course, compatibility is a bit up in the air and at this time it is most likely that they will only be compatible with the new iPad Pro.\n\nOn the other hand, what we find is a Magic Keyboard with reinforced trackpad. Not the trackpad, but the keyboard itself. A much more robust material is expected to guarantee greater resistance and it is also speculated that its USB-C port allows not only to charge the iPad, but also to transfer files, something that sounds technologically complex, but is on the table.\n\nThat new keyboard It could also have a larger trackpad, although it is not clear in what way. Given the dimensions, it is most likely that, if it ends up growing, it will grow in width and not height. Likewise, and this is also speculation, there are those who believe that the keyboard could be much more versatile in terms of positions, something that is limited to a few angles in previous models. In this case, sole compatibility with the new iPad Pro seems safer.\n\nThere will be no attendance at Apple Park by the press unlike other occasions. Yes, some small events are being organized, such as the one in London, which will be attended by members of Applesfera. However, it will be an event aimed at streaming and that It can be seen from YouTube, the Apple website or the 'Apple TV' app. Exactly the same as the previous ones.\n\nAnd as happened with the last event held by Apple, the one titled 'Scary Fast', it is likely that its duration will be shorter than what we are used to.

For example, the iPad 11, which is the most basic, is expected in September along with the iPhone 16. The iPad mini, for its part, could delay its appearance even further.

The event will be live-streamed on Apple.com and YouTube. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that the event will last about 35 minutes. The tech company will introduce new iPad Pro and iPad Air models as well as upgraded editions of the Apple Pencil and the Magic Keyboard. Here's a breakdown of the latest rumors.\n\nAccording to a supply chain report, the organization is considering launching two new iPad Pro sizes with an M4 chip. They disclosed that it may have an OLED display and be much more slender, thanks to smaller bezels. The article mentions that some of the news suggests that the new iPad Pro will be compatible with MagSafe.\n\nThere may be a matte choice for the screen, a land-oriented front camera, and a refreshed 12.9-inch model. They may also announce two new iPad Air models with the M2 chip. The land-orientation front camera will be one of the models, including the 12.9-inch iPad Air, known as the greatest. It may unveil a new Magic Keyboard for the iPad. The new model could have an aluminum body and a larger trackpad.\n\nThe tech giant might announce a new version of the Apple Pencil, which would feature haptic feedback and a \"squeeze\" gesture for selected functions. There is a good chance that it will support Vision Pro, which could be related to the anticipated visionOS 2 update. This event will happen a few days before WWDC, the annual Apple developers conference.\n\nTo conclude, the new event is likely to present significant news about its iPad models and accessories.

The event is here so here's your chance. We're a few years into a continuously more confusing iPad lineup, so it's about time we cooled off, realized we made some mistakes, and simplified the lineup back to its glory days.\n\nIf you haven't noticed, Apple's iPad lineup has gotten more complicated over the last few years. Between the introduction of the 10th generation iPad, keeping the 9th generation iPad around, and introducing even more Apple Pencil and iPad keyboard models, buying an iPad has never been as weird or tough of a decision for consumers as it's been lately.\n\nThe introduction of the 10th-generation iPad is really the thing that created this entire mess. While it was redesigned to match the design language of the iPad Air and the iPad Pro (which is great), it only works with the 1st generation Apple Pencil despite having a USB-C connector. This decision alone created a terrible experience for anyone interested in the latest version of the base model tablet.\n\nThe latest-generation base iPad also doesn't work with the Magic Keyboard. Instead, Apple has released the Magic Keyboard Folio, a completely new keyboard accessory exclusive to the 10th-generation iPad -- no other iPad in the lineup can use this keyboard so it was literally created by necessity since the company didn't do the smart thing, and just make it compatible with the Magic Keyboard.\n\nDue to the Apple Pencil issue that Apple created with the 10th-generation iPad, the company also had to create another model of that product to fix its own problem. Last fall, the company announced a new version of the Apple Pencil that added USB-C for all you 10-gen iPad owners, but the accessory missed out on wireless pairing and charging, pressure sensitivity, and the ability to Double Tap to change tools.\n\nThe sacrifices that Apple accepted with the 10th-gen iPad created such a confusing product and accessory lineup that has made buying a base-model iPad nothing short of a mess for anyone who does not follow this stuff religiously. I feel bad for anyone who doesn't know about this stuff and walks unsuspectingly into an Apple Store right now.\n\nApple likely made these decisions in order to reach a price point it felt it needed to but, as I pointed out before, sticking with the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil (2nd gen) would only have cost base model iPad owners an extra $100 compared to the Magic Folio and USB-C Apple Pencil. That's not much of a difference when the latter would already cost almost $800 if you bundle everything together.\n\nI really hope that the company fixes this at its May 7th event. I know most of the event is expected to focus on the iPad Pro and its next-generation Apple Pencil, but I'd love to see a re-simplification of the lower-end models of the lineup. It's actually pretty crazy that Apple's base model iPads are a more complicated purchasing decision than its high-end models.\n\nDespite my hope, I'm not sure we'll see that. The latest rumors indicate that, outside of a new Apple Pencil and next-generation iPad Pro, the only other iPad we might see at the event is a new iPad Air. If that's the case, we're going to have to wait until at least October to likely see an update to the base model iPad.", "source": {"uri": "bgr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BGR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_wituschek@bgr.com", "name": "Joe Wituschek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Genius_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boy Genius Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Store", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Store"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ipad-lineup-2024.jpg?resize=1200%2C628", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 2711, "textEnd": 2718}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Much like its final event of 2023, taglined \"Scary Fast,\" this will be a digital-only event.\n\nThose interested in watching can stream the event on Apple's official website or its YouTube channel.\n\nWhat to expect at Apple's Let Loose event\n\nTraditionally, Apple does not officially share which of its hardware categories will appear ahead of its event; however, we have a good idea of what might appear.\n\nAnticipate iPads being the center focus for a few reasons. One is that the iPad Air and Pro models are due for an upgrade. Both products were last updated in March and October 2022, respectively. More importantly, if you look at the Let Loose logo for the event, you will notice an artistic Apple logo featuring a hand holding an Apple Pencil, the stylus compatible with iPads.\n\nAside from the obvious spec bumps, rumors suggest the sixth-generation iPad Air will be the first in its lineup to introduce two sizes similar to the iPad Pro. In contrast, Apple's flagship tablet, the iPad Pro, is rumored to include an OLED display.\n\nBoth devices will undoubtedly get Apple silicon, but it remains a toss-up as to which. The iPad Air will likely get the M2 chip as its current model received the M1 chip, while the iPad Pro could follow the order of its previous two generations and receive the M3 processor.\n\nSome speculate that Apple may also announce the M4 chip. If that is the case, it will mark the first time an M-series chip has debuted on an iPad before a Mac computer. However, if the M4 chip is revealed, Apple will likely make it exclusive for the iPad Pro until it announces new Macs (possibly something the company will announce at WWDC next month).\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gruman further reported that the iPad Air will get M2 chips, while the iPad Pro models will get the M4 chips. The latter, in particular, is rumored to \"feel more like computers,\" according to Gurman. This feels like a direction the company has been taking with at least the flagship tablet for the last several years, from the release of accessories like the Magic Keyboard to adding the M-series to the products.\n\nThe Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil may also get updates\n\nRegarding accessories, the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil will likely get an update. In a separate report published last year, Gurman wrote that the Magic Keyboard would get a serious revamp, noting the accessory would \"make the iPad Pro look even more like a laptop than the current setup\" along with a larger trackpad.\n\nAs for the Apple Pencil, previous rumors have suggested that the event will unveil a third-generation Apple Pencil. Apple updated the accessory last November, adding USB-C support. However, it serves more as a low-end model due to its $79 price tag, lack of support for features like pressure sensitivity, and no wireless pairing or charging support.\n\nThere is a possibility that Apple may release a \"Pro\" variant of the stylus as MacRumors reported on May 6 that Apple's website in Japan mentioned the \"Apple Pencil Pro\" when describing the GIF for the Let Loose event. Regardless of what the new Apple Pencil is officially named, the new stylus is rumored to include interchangeable magnetic tips and a squeeze gesture.\n\nWhatever the case, keep an eye on IGN for a complete rundown of everything announced at Apple's Let Loose Event.\n\nTaylor is a Reporter at IGN.

The rumours make it clear that Apple thinks this latest refresh is a big one, and it could possibly reinvent the somewhat confusing SKU bloat that's hindered the tech giant's tablet line for years.\n\nIn January, Bloomberg's Apple guru Mark Gurman reported that Apple has wide-ranging designs. Nothing's changed as far as what's coming down the pike. According to Bloomberg, this first iPad refresh in 18 months will include four models: the J717, J718, J720, and J721.\n\nAs first reported by Apple Insider, quoting from market researchers at Display Supply Chain Consultants, there have been a few snags with manufacturing the latest tablets. Still, now that Apple has a little more breathing room, there hopefully won't be any more delays.\n\nThe event is less than 48 hours away (and is rumoured to only be 35 minutes) Bloomberg Apple insider Mark Gurman has noted that the upcoming iPad Pro could be a replacement laptop. The neglected iPad Air will have an M2 Chip while the Pro will have the M4 Gurman reported.\n\nIn the same newsletter, Gurman said the iPad lineup from Wednesday morning will feature 5 devices: the 10th generation iPad, the ninth generation, the iPad Air, the iPad Mini and the iPad Pro.\n\nAs the day nears to the launch, so too do the rumours. Today's nugget is from MacRumors where Display Supply Chain Consultants have called the upcoming iPad Pro \"by far the best OLED tablet panels on the market\". These new displays are reported to have LTPO, a 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate and ultra thin and light displays. I guess we will see what happens on May 8.\n\nApple insider Gurman has reported that the iPad Pros could come with the M4 chip rather than the M3 chip. The M4 chip will have a new neural engine that will boost the device's AI capabilities. Gurman said he believes Apple will be pushing this device as the first \"AI-powered\" Apple device.\n\n2024 iPad Pro Release Date\n\nWe are currently unsure of the release date but with Apple's \"Let Loose\" event in the Calendar for May 8, which we are expecting to see the OLED iPads unveiled with a release day probably a few weeks after that.\n\nBased on routine hints by industry analysts, it's become well-known that Apple wants to make an 11.1-inch and a 13-inch iPad Pro with OLED. That's compared to the most recent 12.9-inch mini-LED version (called Liquid Retina XDR) and 11-inch IPS LCD version that currently occupy the top end of Apple's tablet line. Those rumors have been reconfirmed by the most recent word from\n\nThe new generation of iPads will be sized slightly differently from previous models. 9to5Mac reported, based on anonymous sources, that the new iPad Pros will be close to 1 mm less thick than the current 10th-gen. The existing 11-inch iPad Pro is 5.9 mm thick, but the new one could be 5.1 mm. The 12.9-inch version currency sits at 6.4 mm, but the new one could be a bare 5.0 mm.\n\nTo complement the new sizes, rumors also suggest we'll see an updated MacBook Air that stretches the screen to 12.9 inches.\n\nThere could be some interesting changes in store for the next OS update to come along with the iPad refresh. For one, the next tablet operating system could drop support for several older-gen iPads. According to a rumour first reported by 9to5Mac, this includes the 2nd-gen 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and the 6th-gen iPad. The rest of the tablets from 2019 and later should still have access to the new OS build.\n\nIf iOS 18's rumored AI enhancements prove true, it would only make sense to bring them to the iPad as well. This could potentially reinvent Siri and perhaps add several new AI-enhanced functions to Apple's portable platforms.\n\nAt the tail end of last month, Apple released the new iPadOS update 17.4.1, which MacRumors confirmed didn't offer any hints about iPadOS 18. At the very least, we can speculate that iPadOS 18 will come out at the same time as iOS 18, which will likely debut at WWDC 2024.\n\nMagsafe\n\nMacRumors claimed, based on a source who works with Apple parts, that the next iPad could support MagSafe wireless charging. There hasn't been word that the Cupertino company would make an all-new MagSafe peripheral for iPads, but we can't help but imagine a charging unit that could double as a hands-free stand. Bloomberg had previously hinted at Apple trying to create a glass-backed iPad that would work with MagSafe.\n\nFor months, rumours surrounded the chip of the iPad Pro with most punters saying it would come with the M3 chip which is in the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. But now Apple insider Gurman has reported the iPad Pros could come with the M4 chip rather than the M3 chip. The M4 chip will have a new neural engine that will boost the device's AI capabilities. Gurman said he believes Apple will be pushing this device as the first \"AI-powered\" Apple device.\n\n2024 iPad Pro Design\n\nThe biggest change to the design this year will most likely be the OLED display but with any new Apple product expect it to be lighter and thinner. Commentators believe there will be an 11-inch and a 12.9-inch (its 13, okay?) model for people to choose from.\n\nMacRumors has the breakdown of the two models comparing them to its 2022 predecessors.\n\nOLED normally costs more than LCD, partly because of materials and partly because fewer factories and makers are available to manufacture the individual components. Based on industry sources, Korean tech rumor site The Elec (via MacRumors) claimed that Samsung is producing the first batch of the 11-inch OLED iPads but that LG is also working on the 13-inch versions.\n\nThe Elec also noted that industry analysts expect Apple to ship 8 million units this year. That's less than what the industry thought the company would ship last year, though it may be based on expected demand more than anything. Apple did have a few issues last year with MacBook sales being down, leading the company to release the M3 MacBook Pros, not even a year after it finally started shipping the M2 version. This did help build hype around the M3 chip, the company's most powerful APU released.\n\nThat said, the iPad Pro would only make sense to see a price increase. Trying to guess an exact price would be like tossing darts blindfolded, but the 13-inch iPad Pro currently starts at $1,899 but can go upwards of $4,000 if you want to opt for more storage options and cellular connectivity. We could guess that a new iPad Pro would cost at least $200 more than the current generation. The Elec has previously reported the next iPad could cost several hundred dollars more, even putting the price at $US1,500 ($2200) for the 11-inch and $US1,800 ($2700) for the 18-inch model, which seems to be a higher jump than seems practical.\n\nAlso, considering the Magic Keyboard's current starting price of $489, a new aluminum material will likely increase the overall cost. The future iPad Pro will be a much more luxury product, which will also recast the Air as a more consumer-grade product overall.\n\n2024 iPad Pro: Accessories\n\nMoreover, there've been hints at additional iPad accessories that could also find their way onto the scene, along with the new Airs and Pros. People digging into the code for iOS 17.4 found mentions of an Apple Pencil 3 that connects with Apple's Find My app. With a surprise release last year, the previous Apple Pencil featured a slide-out USB-C slot. That pencil version also lacked pressure sensitivity, so a new version with more sensitivity options could fit well with the new \"Pro\" lineup.\n\nThe new iPad could also introduce an all-new keyboard. Gurman previously mentioned that Apple is trying to redesign the Magic Keyboard to work with the iPad. Rumors suggest the new keyboard will have a larger trackpad. Most importantly, Apple could switch to aluminum for the top portion of its keyboard, which would give it much more of a MacBook feel than ever before. The cover material would remain the same, but it would make the whole keyboard a lot sturdier for those who want to use their iPad as their main daily driver.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo AU"}, "authors": [{"uri": "athina_mallis@gizmodo.com.au", "name": "Athina Mallis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacRumors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MacRumors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagSafe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MagSafe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Mini", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Mini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(1st_generation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad (1st generation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retina display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPS panel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LG Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://gizmodo.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ipad-pro-oled.png?quality=75", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 78, "textEnd": 83, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The presentation, which is expected to be about 35 minutes, should set the product on a new path. It's also an opportunity to clean up the confusing iPad lineup, which is currently made up of five different models.\n\nHere's how the iPad line will probably look after Tuesday:\n\n* iPad (ninth generation), with a 10.2-inch screen and a home button.\n\n* iPad (10th generation), with a 10.9-inch screen and no home button.\n\n* iPad mini (sixth generation), with a 8.3-inch screen.\n\n* iPad Air: 11-inch and 12.9-inch models, with M2 chips.\n\n* iPad Pro: 11-inch and 12.9-inch models, with M4 chips.\n\nBy next year, Apple plans to finish cleaning up the line. The ninth-generation iPad will be gone, replaced by a cheaper 10.9-inch model, and the iPad mini will have a faster chip. Altogether, Apple will have its least-cluttered iPad lineup in years.\n\nMoreover, the top-end iPads will feel more like computers. The new aluminum Magic Keyboard is expected to be more durable, with a laptop-like aesthetic.

It will be the \"Let Loose\" that introduce us to the new iPad Pro, iPad Air and new accessories such as the Apple Pencil and the Magic Keyboard. One of the most anticipated accessories has already given the first clue and was discovered by the user @ribu_ap712 in X. According to the source code on Apple.com in Japan there is a description of a header image with an \"Apple Pencil Pro.\"\n\nIt is very strange that these types of events can be found on Apple's websites. Curiously, this name is not in the code of the US version of Apple in the English language. It is not clear whether it is the Apple Pencil that everyone is waiting for or it is evidently a new Pro version. The new model could adopt a new gesture that will detect pressure with haptic feedback. While drawing on the iPad, the user would have access to certain actions by applying pressure on the pencil.\n\nWhat is guaranteed are the two iPad models, although with a slight unknown. In recent weeks it was revealed that the M4 chip will appear to be incorporated into the iPad Pro. This detail caused Apple to announce an event soon, of which it is known there will be an in-person activation in London. Another important novelty about the iPad is the new size of the iPad Air, which will be 12.9 inches.. The latest rumors indicated that it will not make the leap to the long-awaited miniLED and will continue to have the IPS LCD panel since its creation.\n\nWhen it was thought that once the month of May arrived there would be a press release launch of the new iPad and accessories, Apple announced the \"Let Loose\" event. The iPads were planned to be launched in March, like any other spring in which new devices have historically been released. A curious fact is that this year a color update was needed on the current iPhone 15.

For months now, it's been on and off sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $249 -- the lowest price of the year.\n\nIn our iPad 9th gen review, we gave it a solid rating of 4 out of 5-stars, praising its bright, vivid Retina display, outstanding performance, and impressive 12-hour battery life.", "source": {"uri": "laptopmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LaptopMag"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A14", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple A14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Mini", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad Mini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Best Buy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Friday (shopping)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retina display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Personalized", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Personalized", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eujpdZVrQ8ApvMVxa4KHqm-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 72, "textEnd": 79}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to launch new iPads on Tuesday, and according to a prominent tech journalist, the tech giant should focus on transforming them into genuine laptop substitutes.\n\nWhat Happened: In the latest installment of his weekly \"Power On\" newsletter, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman suggested that Apple should prioritize making the iPad a true laptop replacement. He argued that Apple has been taking half-measures in this direction and needs to make a firm commitment.\n\n\"From a business standpoint, there's always been a fear that the iPad will cannibalize Mac sales if it gets too powerful. So what? Neither category is doing that hot right now,\" Gurman said, adding, \"Apple should just make the best iPad it can, while also making the best Mac it can. The days of purposely holding back the iPad need to end.\"\n\nAccording to Gurman, Apple has made some progress in this area, such as introducing the Magic Keyboard and trackpad. However, these changes were not enough to make the iPad feel like a laptop replacement.\n\nHe also mentioned that Apple's attempts to improve multitasking on the iPad, such as the Stage Manager feature, have been unsuccessful. Moreover, equipping the iPad with Mac-level chips was largely a marketing exercise, the columnist said.\n\nThe tech analyst said Apple needs to clarify its vision for the iPad and make it as capable as a laptop, but in a form that tablet users prefer. He suggested that the Mac should be for consumers who prefer working on a traditional computer, while the iPad should be for people who want the option of a touch screen.\n\n\"Now it's time for Apple to take a stand. Does it want the iPad to be a half-baked laptop alternative or a real computing replacement,\" he asked, and then stated, \"Fixing the situation starts with making the high-end iPad range look more like their Mac counterparts. And that's just what Apple seems poised to do.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.\n\nWhy It Matters: Apple's upcoming iPad launch follows a significant overhaul of its iPad lineup. On Tuesday, the company plans to announce the launch of new iPad Pro and iPad Air models, ending an 18-month drought.\n\nThe new models, including 11-inch and 12.9-inch OLED iPad Pro models with M4 chips, 11-inch and an enlarged 12.9-inch iPad Air with M2 chips, and updated Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessories, are expected to be unveiled.\n\n\"It's also high time for Apple to give the iPad a more intuitive and useful multitasking experience. If the company can pull that off -- combined with the new hardware and a focus on AI -- Apple could once again make the iPad feel like the future,\" according to Gurman.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next: Apple CEO Tim Cook Says China Is 'The Most Competitive Market In The World' As iPhone Sales Take A Hit\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto by DenPhotos on Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchscreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer multitasking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet_PCs", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet PCs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEE5Q2H8_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

As usual, the event will be held virtually as a pre-recorded event, allowing everyone to get a taste of what Apple will be showing off without the need to fly to Cupertino.\n\nTomorrow's Let Loose gala is kicking off unusually early for an Apple event, starting at 7 a.m. Pacific Time rather than the more typical 10 a.m. downbeat. That puts it at 10 a.m. for those on the East Coast and, perhaps more significantly, 3 p.m. in London, UK, where Apple is scheduling press briefings to coincide with the event, according to The Independent.\n\nThat could explain the earlier start time, but it's also possible Apple is just being whimsical in some way. While earlier events are unusual, they're not unheard of, especially when Apple hosts them somewhere other than Cupertino. For example, Apple held a March education event in Chicago in 2018 that started at 10 a.m. local time (CT), putting it at 8 a.m. in Cupertino.\n\nHowever, it went in a different direction last fall with Scary Fast, which ran at 5:00 p.m. PT / 8:00 p.m. ET. While some speculated that this was being done to align the schedule with Japan time for a tie-in with a Japanese game developer, nothing of that sort ever materialized, and it ultimately just seemed that Apple was having fun with a Halloween theme.\n\nEither way, it will be an early morning for those who want to watch from the West Coast, and according to Mark Gurman, it's going to be a pretty short event, lasting only 35 minutes -- about as long as Scary Fast did last fall. That means you'll want to be prepared so you don't miss it. Here's how you can tune in.\n\nThe best way to watch Apple Events is usually the company's own TV app, which is available on the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, and Vision Pro. Apple once had a dedicated Apple Events app, but it folded that into the TV app just before its first virtual Worldwide Developer's Conference in June 2020.\n\nAs of this writing, Let Loose has yet to appear in the Apple TV app, but it will likely appear later today. For now, you can search \"Apple Events\" to find a list of previous special events. However, the TV app is the best way to watch Apple events as you don't usually have to do any searching; they're prominently featured in the home section of the app, and Let Loose should show up there by tomorrow morning.\n\nTomorrow's event should also be available in the Apple TV app on other platforms, such as smart TVs, game consoles, and streaming boxes.\n\nYou can also find Apple events live-streamed on its official YouTube channel, and, as usual, there's already a placeholder for tomorrow's event.\n\nSince the YouTube app is available on nearly every platform and in almost every modern browser, this is probably the most accessible way to watch Let Loose. You can even visit the page right now and click \"Notify Me\" to set a reminder so you won't miss it.\n\nFor those who aren't really into YouTube, Apple also live-streams its events directly from its Apple Events website, where it can be viewed in nearly any modern browser. This includes Safari on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, as well as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge on a Mac or PC.\n\nIt's easy enough to remember since you only need to go to apple.com to get there. Bookmark it now or visit it tomorrow morning, and you'll be ready to go. You can also go there now and click the \"Add to your calendar\" link to add an appointment to your calendar app automatically.\n\nAs usual, there's no official word from Apple on what the company will announce tomorrow. However, this time around, it's given us plenty of hints, even aside from what the rumor mill has to say.\n\nChief among these is Tim Cook's \"Pencil us in\" tweet, which includes the same logo and animation used to promote the event since the invites went out.\n\nThat makes it pretty obvious we're talking about an Apple Pencil, and with an Apple Pencil comes Apple tablets. Reports have been swirling for months of new iPads, and even without those, it would be pretty obvious that we're overdue for some.\n\nApple last refreshed its iPad lineup in late 2022, when it released the 10th-generation iPad and an iPad Pro duo that was little more than a spec bump to put the latest M2 chip inside. After that, 2023 became the first year in iPad history that we saw and heard nothing from Apple about any of its tablets.\n\nBy all reports, the drought will end tomorrow when Apple unveils significant upgrades to the iPad Pro lineup that will feature OLED screens for the first time, plus an even thinner design. There are also rumors that Apple could unveil the M4 chip in the iPad Pro even before it comes to its first MacBooks later this year. Take that one with a grain of salt, but there is evidence to suggest that the iPad Pro could be getting a more powerful chip, perhaps something like an \"M3X.\"\n\nThe iPad Air is also expected to get a big brother in the form of a 12.9-inch model. Other than that additional model and a new landscape camera placement, Apple's mid-tier tablet won't likely be more than a spec bump.\n\nThe new iPads will be accompanied by a new Apple Pencil that's expected to be redesigned to accommodate charging in a different spot (since the camera will be on the longer edge) and add new gestures such as a \"squeeze\" motion and possibly even an eraser.\n\nWe're also expecting a new Magic Keyboard design that will move to aluminum and adopt a more durable, laptop-like design. There's a good chance this may be exclusive to the iPad Pro, as Gurman suggests that Apple is planning a full-court press to turn the iPad Pro into a \"true laptop replacement,\" which is why he believes Apple will debut its next-generation M4 silicon on the iPad Pro while leaving its entire Mac lineup behind on the M3.\n\nWith that new chip, Apple is also expected to tout some new generative AI features for the iPad Pro. However, these will likely be mostly teasers as much will depend on iPadOS 18, which won't be unveiled until next month's Worldwide Developers Conference.\n\nLastly, expect Apple to announce the release dates for iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5, if not at the event, in a newsroom announcement shortly after. The new iPads will almost certainly ship with iPadOS 17.5, and if Apple sticks to its usual playbook, the public releases of those will come a day or two before the new iPad models go on sale.", "source": {"uri": "idropnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iDrop News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_event", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halloween"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japanese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smart TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Chrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.idropnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Apple-Event-May-7-in-Safari-800x480.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 2011, "textEnd": 2020}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

( Image Source :Getty )\n\nThe launch of the iPad Air (6th gen) is expected to be just a day away. The release is rumoured to take place at the 'Let Loose' event which will be held on Tuesday (May 7). The sixth generation of iPad will be launched after a gap of two years since the last iPad was launched by Apple. The upcoming device has been rumoured to bring a number of new features in the hands of the users which is expected to bridge the gap between the iPad Pro series. Let us go through what all we know about iPad Air (6th gen) and its launch.\n\niPad Air (6th Gen): Launch Date, Price (Expected)\n\nApple is set to unveil the latest iPad Air series alongside the iPad Pro on May 7, with sales expected to start the following week.\n\nIn terms of pricing, the 11-inch iPad is anticipated to retain the same price as its previous model (Rs 59,900), while the 12.9-inch variant may see an increase of around Rs 10,000 in India.\n\niPad Air (6th Gen): Specifications (Expected)\n\nAccording to recent reports, these iPad Air models will continue to feature a standard LED panel, known as Liquid Retina display by Apple. Although mini LED displays offer enhanced contrast levels and brightness compared to regular LED panels, they also come with a higher production cost. It appears that Apple may opt for regular LED panels to effectively manage manufacturing costs. The refresh rate is predicted to remain at 60 Hz. Additionally, the bezels on the upcoming models are expected to resemble those of the 5th Gen iPad Air.\n\nApple has built a reputation for adopting swift PCIe storage technologies, a trend the 6th Generation iPad Air is poised to continue. Unlike its predecessor, which caps at 256 GB of storage, the upcoming model is rumoured to offer a substantial upgrade with up to 1 TB of storage space.\n\nThe tech giant is anticipated to adjust the front-facing camera's orientation from portrait to landscape to enrich the video calling experience, mirroring a shift seen in the 10th Gen iPad. However, leaks from Instant Digital suggest that despite this adjustment, the camera's specifications will likely remain unchanged. The iPad Air is expected to house a 12 MP sensor for its front camera, with a matching 12 MP camera anticipated on the device's rear.\n\nThe current iPad Air, powered by the M1 chip, already boasts significant power. The forthcoming model is speculated to receive a boost with the M2 chip, promising substantial improvements in CPU, GPU, and AI performance. Furthermore, Apple might elevate the base model's storage capacity to 128 GB, doubling the existing amount, and equip it with at least 8 GB of RAM. These added resources are positioned to support upcoming AI features slated for WWDC 2024.\n\nBoth variants of the iPad Air are predicted to feature larger batteries, possibly incorporating enhanced fast-charging capabilities.

Here's what to expect at the event and what might come later:\n\nThe highlight is a fresh iPad Pro sporting a revamped design and a sharper screen. This iPad will be the first to feature an OLED display.\n\nIt's rumored to come in 11-inch and 12.9-inch sizes and could debut with Apple's first M4 processors, boosting AI capabilities. These chips are expected to be detailed further in June.\n\nBoth iPad Pros are anticipated to slim down, with the larger model becoming about 20% thinner and the smaller one around 15% thinner. The switch to OLED displays will likely drive these changes.\n\nA thinner design might mean less space for the battery, but any impact is expected to be balanced by efficiency gains from the OLED screen.\n\nThe iPad Air will also see updates, including a new 12.9-inch option, matching the size of the iPad Pro. Both the new and existing 10.9-inch models are likely to be powered by the M2 chip.\n\nMagic Pencil: The revised Pencil may feature haptic feedback, allowing users to feel subtle vibrations during interactions. It might also introduce squeeze gestures for additional functionality, alongside Find My integration.\n\nMagic Keyboard: Expect an improved Magic Keyboard, possibly made from aluminum for durability. The design might make the iPad resemble a laptop more closely, and a larger trackpad is also rumored.\n\nAccording to him:\n\nMark Gurman also highlighted a decline in iPad sales post the pandemic sales surge, particularly evident in the last quarter with a 17% drop.

The event will take place on May 7 at 4:00 p.m. (Spain) and will be mainly focused on the presentation of new hardware products such as iPad Air, iPad Pro, Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard.\n\nWe recently discovered that Apple's special event will be a different event and, in the words of Mark Gurman, it will be about a previously filmed event lasting about 35 minutes. Let's see which products are ruled out for Apple's special Let Loose event.\n\nIn Mark Gurman's weekly newsletter on Bloomberg They have anticipated what products could be presented and which will be delayed for a few months in 2024. In total, there will be 5 new features that will not be presented at the Let Loose event.\n\nLately there has been speculation about the possibility that The presentation of the new iPad at the Let Loose event could reveal some clue about artificial intelligence functions of iPadOS 18 but Mark Gurman claims that Apple \"won't formally reveal\" the AI news until the WWDC conference in June 2024.\n\nThe successor to the 10th generation iPad presented will take a little longer to wait. In principle Apple will present two new iPad Air models and two new versions of the iPad Pro at its Let Loose event. Another rumor suggests that Apple is hard at work developing the new 11th generation iPad but it will not be presented at the May event. It will be the cheapest iPad of 2024.\n\nEverything seems to indicate that the new iPad mini 7 will completely redefine the concept of a compact tablet, but its launch will not take place after the special event on May 7.

As the company led by Tim Cook did not present any iPad in 2023, Currently the most powerful iPad of the moment is the iPad Pro of 2022. A tablet that, by the way, is on sale on Amazon and has a very brutal discount.\n\nThe 2022 iPad Pro hit the market with an M2 chip from Apple Silicon capable of matching the performance of a high-end laptop processor. It's a bug. In addition, one of its versions has a gigantic 12.9-inch screen with which it is wonderful to watch all the May premieres on Apple TV+ and other streaming platforms.\n\nLet's go a little deeper into the features of this Apple iPad Pro, highlighting all the reasons why you should buy this 12.9-inch model before any other tablet on the market. First of all, we are looking at what is possibly the most powerful iPad in history and the most coveted tablet on the market.\n\nApple has been leading the tablet market with its iPad for many years. Its products have a very polished and high quality design, plus they receive software updates for decades. Especially in the case of tablets.\n\nThe iPad Pro that we recommend you buy today has a very interesting discount, but this does not mean that it is a refurbished device. Not at all. It's a brand new iPad and that's 140 euros that you save to buy other accessories such as keyboards, covers or briefcases.\n\nThe iPad Pro in this offer has 128 GB of storage, Wi-Fi and is available in silver. Equips a large 12.9-inch Liquid Retina XDR display with technology mini-LEDa M2 chip accompanied by 8 GB of RAM and an autonomy of 10 hours. Remember, it has a discount of 140 euros and costs around 1,300 euros. There are only a few units left so take advantage of the offer!\n\nIt is a highly recommended iPad Pro and it will last you many years.

After the longest period ever between the launch of iPads, we know that Apple is about to reveal what's up its sleeve. Here's everything you need to know, from the exact timings to what is, and what isn't, going to be announced.\n\nThe next special event is an online affair, and you can tune in to hear the news on Tuesday, May 7 at 7 a.m. Pacific, 10 a.m. Eastern, 3 p.m. U.K. Take note of these times because this is not the normal keynote timing.\n\nMay 6 update below. This post was first published on May 5, 2024.\n\nYou can watch on apple.com, on Apple's YouTube channel, which already has a countdown page in place, or on Apple TV.\n\nThis is the most exciting part of the expected announcements, with two new iPad Pro models predicted. There will be new 11-inch and 12.9-inch Pros, possibly with the screen size edging up a fraction. There will be an all-new design, changing the look of the tablets for the first time in more than three years. Expect slimmer bezels around the screen and a repositioning of the FaceTime camera to the longer edge instead of the shorter edge of the display as now.\n\nThe display, on both sizes, will be OLED -- the first time an iPad will have this technology and it will mark the end to the disparity between Pro sizes. Currently only the larger iPad Pro has miniLED backlighting.\n\nThat should have been the biggest news, but the latest report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman made a surprising claim: Apple could, he says, launch an all-new Apple processor, the M4, something even the latest Macs can't match.\n\nI'll be honest, I'm still skeptical on the M4 detail, and I predict that M3 is more likely here, but we'll see.\n\nThe sting in the tail could be a hefty price increase brought about by the OLED screen.\n\nExpected release date: Friday, May 17.\n\nApple has never launched new models of the iPad Pro and iPad Air together, so Tuesday will be a very big day for that reason alone.\n\nWe're expecting not one but two new iPads Air. For the first time, there will be two sizes of iPad Air. Alongside the current 10.9-inch model, an iPad Air with a 12.9-inch display is coming, it seems.\n\nThis makes sense: the latest MacBook Air with larger display has been a big success. But it does mean Apple will need to clearly demarcate between Air and Pro if they are both released in similar sizes.\n\nOne difference will be the OLED screens, which are not expected to land on the Air. One report claimed that the larger Air would use unsold inventory of 12.9-inch iPad Pro displays with miniLED, but then quickly rowed back from this on the basis that it would push the price of the Air up too much.\n\nExpected release date: Friday, May 17 or Friday, May 24.\n\nThere's an Apple Pencil in the image used to advertise the event, so it would be remarkable if there wasn't a new Pencil. The latest report says that it will have haptic feedback and a new way of interacting with it: by squeezing the Pencil.\n\nExpected release date: Friday, May 17.\n\nOne report said that Tuesday's event will have a big AI component. While there doubtless will be talk of AI, especially if the Pro does have an M4 chip, the big generative AI innovations will come with WWDC in June.\n\nAnd there have been rumors that Apple will announce bringing Apple Vision Pro to the U.K., for instance, but I don't think that's right. It's just possible that the China release of Vision Pro could be signaled, but my guess is that WWDC will be the venue for international sales announcements of the headset.\n\nMay 6 update. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman wrote much about the new iPads in his latest Power On newsletter, and there were some interesting nuggets.\n\nFirst up, he says the keynote won't be the marathon that some special events are. Speaking of the iPad, he says, \"The presentation, which is expected to be about 35 minutes, should set the product on a new path.\" As a guide, that's longer than the Scary Fast keynote which was Apple's last, back in October, but not by much (that one ran to a little under 31 minutes).\n\nGiven that Apple managed to launch not one but three M3 chips -- the first time it had ever revealed three at the same time -- as well as two new MacBook Pro models, including an all-new Space Black finish, we know that Apple can fit a lot into half an hour.\n\nGurman also talked about how Steve Jobs positioned the original iPad as a replacement for laptops in some circumstances. Gurman again: \"In a way, Jobs was right. But not necessarily because of the iPad. There are millions of people who now use the iPhone as their primary computer. Smartphones have become incredibly capable, and larger screens have turned them into small tablets with computer-like performance. For many people, a phone is all they need.\"\n\nHe thinks this will be the moment when Apple could make clear what the iPad is, because, \"Consumers are confused about why they should buy an iPad versus a Mac and vice versa.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FaceTime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Backlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(1st_generation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad (1st generation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6627d0cc96538df1652f21f1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 351, "textEnd": 356}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 478, "textEnd": 483, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1803, "textEnd": 1809, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 2700, "textEnd": 2706}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Could Apple finally make the iPad a serious rival for laptops? Thanks to a redesigned Magic Keyboard, a new Apple Pencil, and the arrival of the M4 chip, that's a strong possibility.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook spurred excitement for the event last week in a press release about Apple's Q2 2024 earnings report, commenting: \"We're also looking forward to an exciting product announcement next week and an incredible Worldwide Developers Conference next month.\"\n\nThe event, \"Let Loose,\" will kick off on an official Apple livestream at 10 a.m. Eastern/7 a.m. Pacific.\n\nThe event marks a turning point for the iPad line-up. It arrives after the first year without a new iPad since the first model was launched 14 years ago.\n\nHere's a look at how Tuesday's announcements could reshape the iPad into the laptop's biggest rival.\n\nWhen Apple launched the Magic Keyboard in 2020, it was clear it wanted to position the iPad as a laptop alternative. This accessory was a far cry from conventional tablet keyboards, which, at the time, were often F.C.A. (flimsy, cramped, and awkward). In contrast, the Magic Keyboard featured laptop-like ergonomics and the same scissor-switch keys found on Macbooks. In our review back in 2020, we put it like this: \"Ultimately, the Magic Keyboard is the best option for turning your Apple tablet into a laptop.\"\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple will launch a redesigned version of the Magic Keyboard on Tuesday, making the iPad look more like a Macbook than ever before.\n\nThe new model is expected to feature an aluminum chassis, so the keyboard deck could look like it was pulled straight from a Macbook Air. The similarities will be even more apparent if Apple redesigns the hinge and magnetic attachment system to allow the iPad to move more like a laptop display when attached to the keyboard.\n\nA larger trackpad is one feature of the new design that could win customers. While the keyboard on the current Magic Keyboard is great, the tiny trackpad makes navigation awkward, especially for those used to a conventional laptop or Macbook touchpad.\n\nIf the new Magic Keyboard has a larger trackpad, it will likely also have a redesigned hinge mechanism. Apple is expected to launch the next generation of iPad Pro models in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes, which limits how big they can make the Magic Keyboard.\n\nHowever, the current models have a wide area of unused space along the top edge of the keyboard deck due to the way the iPad hovers over it. If Apple found a way to rework the hinge mechanism, it could potentially utilize that space to make room for a larger touchpad.\n\nThere are currently three Apple Pencil models available on Apple's website: the 1st-generation Apple Pencil, the USB-C Apple Pencil, and the 2nd-generation Apple Pencil. The latter two can attach magnetically to modern iPads, while the 1st-generation model is long overdue for retirement.\n\nApple is expected to launch a new premium Apple Pencil on Tuesday loaded with new features. It will likely replace the 2nd-generation Apple Pencil, kicking the 1st-generation Apple Pencil out of the line-up, simplifying it to just the premium 3rd-generation model and the more budget-friendly USB-C model.\n\nThe 3rd-generation Apple Pencil will also help launch the new line-up of iPads as fully-fledged laptop rivals. There are plenty of great 2-in-1 laptops out there that include a pencil accessory, like the HP Spectre x360. While these devices can deliver fantastic performance and stellar build quality, they're always a bit better at being a laptop than a tablet. Their pencil accessories are often only useful in niche cases rather than seamlessly integrated into navigation.\n\nWith a more powerful chip and a more laptop-like keyboard accessory, the iPad can position itself as the superior alternative to 2-in-1s, particularly for fans of tablet mode.\n\nApple Pencil functionality is baked into the iPad already, with native apps that utilize it and streamlined support for navigation using the Pencil. The new model could take things up a notch with squeeze-activated controls, redesigned interchangeable tips, and haptic feedback.\n\nThose features could potentially make navigation so intuitive that the Pen could effortlessly replace a mouse for precise navigation in tablet mode. Plus, the iPad's modularity makes it much more comfortable to use in tablet mode compared to many 2-in-1 laptops since you can fully detach the Magic Keyboard.\n\nThe current iPad Pro models, launched in 2022, include the M2 chip. With no new iPads in 2023, there's a strong chance that Apple will skip the M3 chip altogether and give the new iPad Pros the M4 chip -- before the Mac gets it. As if that wasn't enough of an upgrade, we expect Apple to unveil the long-awaited OLED iPad Pro finally.\n\nThe iPad Pro has been marketed as a laptop replacement for years, but both upgrades could take that rivalry to a new level. Apple may be giving the iPad the M4 chip before the MacBook Pro, which tells us what the company hopes to accomplish with the next generation of iPads. For the first time, the iPad Pro may be equally, if not more, powerful than the MacBook.\n\nThe big question will then be how Apple will utilize all that power in the new iPad Pro. This is where the timing of Tuesday's event gets a bit awkward. Apple typically reveals software updates at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which will kick off on June 10. So, Apple could end up showing off powerful new iPads tomorrow without major software updates to accompany them.\n\nWhile we won't know for sure until we get an official announcement from Apple, there are a few key ways the new iPad Pro models could use the power of the M4 chip to compete with laptops.\n\nFirst, the M4 chip is expected to build off the success of the M3 with more AI capabilities. Apple's growing focus on AI was one of the biggest takeaways from last week's earnings report. It would make sense for Apple to use the M4 chip to debut a suite of AI tools and features for iPadOS. Those could include an overhauled Siri AI, generative AI capabilities, AI-powered browser features, and more.\n\nAI and the M4 chip will be useful for resource-intensive apps that have struggled with the iPad. Final Cut Pro is a prime example. Even after a big update in 2023, the iPad version of Final Cut Pro lacks the same features and flexibility as the original Mac app. That could finally change with the additional power of the M4 chip, iPadOS 18, and new AI features like automated editing tools.\n\nWhen popular, resource-intensive apps like Final Cut Pro run just as well on an iPad as on a Mac or laptop, more customers may consider making the switch, particularly with redesigned accessories.\n\nWhile the Macbook Pro isn't going anywhere, the next generation of iPads could overshadow the 2-in-1 laptop market. The iPad's destiny might not be a laptop replacement but a modular alternative to laptops, offering the same performance in a distinctive, flexible form factor.\n\nWe'll have to wait until Tuesday to see exactly what Apple does with its iPad redesign, but there's plenty to be excited about. We will be covering all the announcements and news from the \"Let Loose\" event, so stay tuned all week for more details and insights about this new era for the iPad -- and the laptop.", "source": {"uri": "laptopmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LaptopMag"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chassis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chassis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-in-1_PC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2-in-1 PC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Cut_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Final Cut Pro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dPWhQkUaj2mve4VuXbx3qY-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 5545, "textEnd": 5552}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

New versions of the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil are also expected, both of which will likely be exclusive to the iPad Pro.\n\nEvidence found on Apple's Japanese site suggests the new Pencil may be dubbed the Apple Pencil Pro. Which got me thinking: adding the Pro name to the Magic Keyboard makes a lot of sense too, especially since only the new iPad Pro will support it.\n\nHere's why it may be just the right time for a Magic Keyboard Pro and Apple Pencil Pro.\n\nFor the past few years, Apple has been inching the iPad Air lineup ever closer to the iPad Pro. The Air gained support for the existing Magic Keyboard. It was equipped with an M-class chip. Reporting points to a new 12.9-inch Air debuting tomorrow, giving the Air the kind of screen real estate that was formerly exclusive to the iPad Pro.\n\nThe iPad Air's continual progression has been accompanied by a slowdown in iPad Pro developments. Some of the biggest differentiators between the two products today are the 12.9-inch model's mini-LED display, which arrived in 2021 and never made its way to the smaller Pro, and the presence of Face ID on the Pro, which dates all the way back to 2018. Otherwise, there's not a lot that sets the iPad Pro apart. Not right now, anyways.\n\nThis is why I believe it's the perfect time for Apple to introduce Pro-exclusive accessories like a Magic Keyboard Pro and Apple Pencil Pro.\n\nThe 2024 iPad Pro will usher in a new era for the Pro lineup, bringing perhaps the most exciting upgrade since the 2018 model. It makes sense, then, that Apple would seize this moment to add the Pro moniker to its new accessories.\n\nLaunching a Magic Keyboard Pro and Apple Pencil Pro would provide a new level of differentiation for the iPad Pro compared to the Air. But also, importantly, they would make the accessory lineup way easier to understand for the average consumer. Keeping track of the nuances between the Apple Pencil (1st gen), Apple Pencil (USB-C), and Apple Pencil (2nd gen) is something even I struggle with.\n\nSlap a 'Pro' name on the accessory, though? Suddenly the complex gets simplified. \"You'd like an iPad Pro? Great, its accessory options include a Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard Pro.\"\n\nUnifying the new accessories under the Pro name would be a win for shoppers and make the iPad Pro a stronger contender against its little siblings like the iPad Air.\n\nThe only downside is technically an upside for Apple: 'Pro' accessories may merit higher price points. As though $349 for a 12.9-inch Magic Keyboard wasn't already enough.", "source": {"uri": "9to5mac.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "9to5Mac"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_christoffel@9to5mac.com", "name": "Ryan Christoffel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/05/pro-magic-keyboard-pencil.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Set to be just over half an hour in duration, the entire event will feature pre-recorded footage akin to the fast-paced 2023 Mac event, with the YouTube link already live on Apple's official page.\n\nWhat to Expect from Apple Let Loose Event 2024\n\nReports suggest that on May 7, during the Let Loose Event 2024, Apple will unveil updates to its mid-tier tablet, the iPad Air. A significant revelation is anticipated: the introduction of a second, larger screen option, with a new 12.9-inch version matching the size of the iPad Pro.\n\nThis move aims to provide consumers with a cost-effective means to access a large-screen tablet, alongside the continued availability of the 10.9-inch version. Both models are expected to receive upgrades featuring the M2 chip.\n\nAdditionally, the event will showcase the latest iPad Pro iteration, boasting an updated design and an OLED display. Enthusiasts can anticipate the new iPad Pros in 11-inch and 12.9-inch screen sizes, potentially powered by Apple's M4 processor.\n\nRumours suggest that the updated Apple Pencil will incorporate haptic feedback, enhancing the user experience, while the new Magic Keyboard is anticipated to offer improved durability and an aluminium chassis, according to reports.\n\nSEE ALSO: macOS 15: Rumoured Features, Release Date, Beta Availability And Everything Else We Know", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/t/mashable_in/photo/default/5cover_um29.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 117, "textEnd": 122, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The event will take place at 4:00 p.m. on May 7 and will bring great news with updates to devices such as iPad Air, iPad Pro, Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard.\n\nIn this guide we will gather all the news, curiosities and features of the Apple event. We will answer the most interesting questions about what will be presented, what products have been discarded, what type of event it will be or what its schedule will be.\n\nEverything seems to indicate that on this occasion, once again, it will be about an event previously filmed and will be broadcast via streaming on the usual Apple platforms. As we have learned over the weekend, the Apple event will last more than half an hour. Specifically, around 35 minutes. So it is expected to be a short event, with few new products but with great news as in the case of the iPad Pro.\n\nIn principle, rumors related to the event indicate that Apple is going to present two iPad Air models, two iPad Pro models, an Apple Pencil 3 or Magic Pencil and a Magic Keyboard 2. The products that Apple will present at the event will consist of a keyboard made of aluminum, an Apple Pencil with many improvements, versions of the iPad Pro with an M4 chip and an OLED screen, and one of the iPad Airs with a 12.9-inch screen. Although, hey, maybe we'll have a few more surprises!\n\nOn the other hand, there are some hardware or software products that have been discarded and that will be presented by Apple in the coming months. The event will not reveal the company's artificial intelligence news or the improvements introduced in the iOS 18 software updates or other operating systems. The introduction of new Mac devices and Apple's AirPods 4 are also not expected.\n\nAnother of the curiosities that we have been able to discover about this May event is that this will be a different event, according to the company's own words. A special event that could surprise the world with great news related to art and creativity.\n\nAs we indicated at the beginning of this guide, The Apple event will be held at 4:00 p.m. in Spain. But below we tell you what time you can start watching Apple's May event in other areas of the planet.\n\nWe hope you are as excited as we are about the imminent arrival of the new iPads at the Apple event and We are waiting for you with open arms to let you know all the details about the Let Loose event..

This format is similar to Apple's previous 'Spooky Fast' MacBook launch, which had a similar runtime. Scheduled to start streaming online at 7:30 pm IST, this event is expected to introduce notable updates to the iPad Pro and iPad Air lineups.\n\nAnalysts anticipate that the iPad Pro will receive significant upgrades, including an OLED display for immersive visuals. Powered by the new M4 chip, it will deliver faster processing speeds and enhanced on-device AI capabilities. However, detailed information on these AI features won't be fully revealed until Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10, 2024.\n\nIn addition to the iPad Pro updates, the iPad Air is expected to be powered by the M2 chip, similar to recent MacBook models. Rumors suggest the possibility of a larger 12.9-inch display option and new accessories like an Apple Pencil with haptic feedback and a refined Magic Keyboard.\n\nWhile many of these potential features have been leaked or speculated on by tech experts, nothing will be certain until Apple's video presentation. With Mark Gurman's 'Power On' newsletter hinting at significant upgrades, the 'Let Loose' event should be an exciting glimpse into Apple's plans for the iPad lineup in 2024.\n\nApple's 'Let Loose' event will stream online at 7:30 pm IST on May 7, 2024.

New OLED iPad Pro and refreshed iPad Air 6 tablets are expected, but anyone hoping for a nice, long, involved announcement will probably be left disappointed.\n\nThat's according to a new report which claims that Apple's whole event might last just 35 minutes, giving Apple barely enough time to get through everything that it is expected to unveil. With four new iPads and at least two new accessories in the cards, CEO Tim Cook and co can be expected to stick to quite a pace to squeeze everything in.\n\nWith Apple updating its iPad lineup for the first time in more than a year, some might have expected more fanfare -- but it now seems clear that Apple's new tablets won't get much stage time come Tuesday morning's event.\n\nThis news comes via Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, writing in the weekly Power On newsletter yesterday. Gurman says that while the event will \"kick off a new era for the iPad,\" it is \"expected to be about 35 minutes\" in length. He suggests that despite the tight timeframe the event could also \"clean up the confusing iPad lineup,\" giving Apple even less time to dive into the new tablets.\n\nNotably, the iPad Pro was tipped to sport M4 chips for the first time, but that seems unlikely given the time limitations. Apple would surely want to dig into the details for any new chip announcement, and at 35 minutes, the event surely won't be long enough.\n\nAlongside the new iPads Apple is also expected to debut the Apple Pencil and a new Apple Magic Keyboard.

Just a few days ago the company announced an event called \"Let Loose\" in which we hope to see new iPads for next May 7 and it seems that it will be one of the shortest events of recent years.\n\nAs reported by Mark Gurman, Apple's \"Let Loose\" event could last only 35 minutes. This gives us a clue that we are facing an event recorded on video and with a format similar to Apple's \"Scary Fast\" event in October, where new M3 chips, new MacBook Pros and a new iMac were presented.\n\nEverything seems to indicate that Apple's \"Let Loose\" event will be very similar to this Halloween event, it even has a strange schedule for Apple, since It will be held at 4:00 p.m. in Spain, probably because we will have a side event in London. Apple itself has already warned that this will be \"a different event\", so we expect a lot of news in a very short time.\n\nIt seems that Apple is getting fond of these types of quick events. Apple's \"Scary Fast\" event barely reached 30 minutes and this one looks like it will be a similar length. Therefore we can expect a video recorded by Apple in which all the news is presented quickly and dynamic.\n\nAs happened in the last event in October, we expect 3 main news in this \"Let Loose\" event: the M4 chip, a new iPad Pro and a new iPad Air. These products will probably also be accompanied by new accessories such as an Apple Pencil 3 or a new Magic Keyboard.\n\nThis event could give a new dimension to the iPad, which for the first time would be responsible for launching a new generation of M series chips. For several years now, the iPad Pro and iPad Air have used the M1 and M2 chips that we also have in Macs, but this time the M4 chip will be shown at an event dedicated to the iPad.\n\nThis could be a clear declaration of intent from Apple that wants to take its tablet to a new level. What's more, the iPad Pro that Apple presents will likely be the only device in Apple's range with the M4 chip, at least for a few weeks or months.", "source": {"uri": "gearrice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gearrice"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julian_solanki@gearrice.com", "name": "Julian Solanki", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IMac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ipadizate.com/hero/2024/04/evento-apple-mayo-2024.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 287, "textEnd": 292}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

My use case centers around reading, taking notes, and streaming videos occasionally, and the iPad Air M1 manages to do these things incredibly well.\n\nAt the start of last year, I wanted a portable device that would allow me to be productive on the go, and while the 10.9-inch panel on the iPad Air was decent enough, I needed something larger, so I switched to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. At the outset, I didn't think there would be a lot of difference between the two other than the larger screen; both models have powerful hardware, a similar design, and the same software.\n\nBut I was wrong. The iPad Pro 12.9 is noticeably better than the iPad Air; the mini-LED panel gets brighter and has much better contrast, and HDR content looks amazing on the device. While I didn't pay attention to this at the time, the quad speakers on the iPad Pro sound much better.\n\nThe biggest difference is the screen refresh, with the iPad Pro getting ProMotion tech that allows it to go up to 120Hz. The iPad Air is limited to 60Hz, and it is immediately evident when using both devices next to each other. And because of the larger size, there's a bigger battery that lasts noticeably longer.\n\nThe main reason for using the iPad Pro is for productivity, and it has been terrific in that regard. For most of the last decade, I followed the same schedule: get up at 6am, finish the day's writing tasks, and then get started with my day. That isn't the case now; my wife and I had a baby last year, and I write whenever I find the time -- my ten-month-old dictates my schedule.\n\nSo I had to learn to do something I'm not very good at: flexibility. I couldn't just lock myself away in my home office and write for hours on end, so I needed something portable. I have a lot of Windows machines, but I wanted something that had a touchscreen and a modular design with plenty of accessories, and that led me to the iPad Pro.\n\nIn the last 10 months, a full 40% of my writing was done on the iPad Pro, and I didn't think I would use the device anywhere as much. The screen is the ideal size -- it's almost the same size as most 13-inch notebooks -- and as it has Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, I was able to add a docking station and connect my mechanical keyboard without any hassle.\n\nBut a big part of why I used the iPad Pro to the extent I did was the Magic Keyboard; the $349 keyboard accessory costs more than most mechanical keyboards, but it is terrific. It attaches securely, has good adjustability, and the keyboard itself is decent; the scissor keys have 1mm travel and are backlit, and they've held up well after nearly a year of use. The trackpad also comes in handy, and it's just easier to use.\n\nBasically, the iPad Pro 12.9 is ideally suited for my use case. While iPadOS doesn't have anywhere close to the productivity features that are available in macOS, that hasn't been an issue -- multitasking isn't something I'm looking for in a portable machine. For the tasks I do daily -- writing, editing photos, and reading -- the iPad Pro is a stellar option. The best Android tablets have similar hardware, but most of these options are limited to Samsung, and while I tolerate One UI on phones, I don't have any intention of using it on a larger device.\n\nThere were weeks when I used the iPad Pro exclusively, and the only issue in doing so was the convoluted file access within iPadOS; other than that, it proved to be a reliable powerhouse. The Magic Keyboard in particular unlocks the full potential of the iPad Pro, but the only quibble with it is that the fabric design doesn't quite match up to its premium asking price. Thankfully, it looks like that's going to change with the 2024 iteration of the iPad Pro.\n\nWhile this is a secondary consideration, the iPad Pro is great for creative use cases. There's no analog to Procreate on Android or Windows, and the drawing utility is incredible. I dabble in music production, and iPadOS has an extensive collection of synths and drum machines, and the larger screen definitely makes a difference in this regard -- as does the ability to connect accessories.\n\nWith new iPads inbound, I'm excited to see what's in store this year. The switch to OLED panels and better software features should give the upcoming iPad Pro a distinct advantage over the MacBook, and I can't wait to see how the series evolves.", "source": {"uri": "androidcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Central"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple M1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Docking station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(interface)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thunderbolt (interface)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchscreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Analog signal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drum machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Hardware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Hardware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dGunFVVPW4YhFRJQjN6exh-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

After a long break between updates, Apple's iPad lineup looks like it will get more than a major update and design refresh during the May 7 'Let Loose' Event. It could improbably be the showcase for the newest piece of Apple Silicon and Apple's Generative AI strategy.\n\nThere's much about this May 2024 Apple iPad Event that's unusual. First, it's being held early in the morning on May 7, starting at 7 AM PT in Apple's hometown of California. Apple usually starts events hours later in the morning, Pacific time.\n\nSecond, it's a virtual event but Apple is calling this, what I expect to be a pre-taped video presentation, a 'Keynote.' Keynotes are usually the first speech in a bigger, ongoing event. To my knowledge, there's nothing ongoing beyond whatever Apple CEO Tim Cook and his cohorts deliver in what is expected to be a 35-minute presentation, according to reliable leaker Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\n\nApple's World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) is now just a little more than a month away, but Apple has apparently chosen this iPad event to reveal a new piece of Apple Silicon: the M4 Chip.\n\nBut wait, it gets weirder.\n\nMost rumors put that new M4 inside Apple's anticipated, high-end iPad Pro 12.4 inch tablet (just one of multiple, anticipated new iPads that includes a pair of new iPad Air tablets).\n\nTypically, Apple introduces Apple Silicon updates in its popular Mac line. The Apple M3 chip showed up in the iMac, MacBook Pro 14, and then the excellent MacBook Air 13 earlier this year. Similarly, the MacBook Air, Mini, and MacBook Pro launched with various flavors of the OG Apple M1 in 2020 before that Apple Silicon showed up in the iPad Pro in 2021, then the following year on the iPad Air.\n\nThat's not all. There are indications that Apple could preview its AI approach on the iPad Pro, a fair assumption since most believe Apple is cooking up on-device Generative AI via the anticipated M4 chip.\n\nPerhaps this will be just a glimpse. Seriously, how much would Apple share about the AI strategy with its developers' conference so soon, in just over a month? No matter what Apple shows on the iPad, Tim Cook recently made it clear that Apple's AI intentions scale way beyond a single device. As he told investors last week on the Apple earning's call, \"We see generative AI as a very key opportunity across our products and believe that we have advantages that set us apart there.\"\n\nApple Generative AI is not just an iPad, Mac, or iPhone play. It's potentially a broad and strategic shift in focus that will underpin the Apple ecosystem.\n\nBut let's go back to Tuesday's Apple Event.\n\nIf all these things are true, Apple is suddenly pulling the iPad firmly back into the spotlight, entrusting it with launching its latest custom CPU and Apple AI. It's a big vote of confidence and a lot of responsibility for a somewhat ignored product category that has, at least on the sales side, floundered a bit in recent years.\n\nSpeaking of which, Apple also promised in the earnings call that iPad sales would see double-digit growth in the next quarter. That's likely confirmation that this is an iPad event, and that Apple will offer more than just a lightweight update.\n\nWhile I'm surprised that Apple is introducing new chips and AI features to the product line in a somewhat backward fashion, it also makes sense. Between now and WWDC 2024, both Microsoft and Google will hold major events, Microsoft Build and Google I/O, which should tell us a lot about their ongoing Generative AI efforts. Those companies have a huge head start on Apple.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft is expected to launch new Surface tablets with Qualcomm chips, like the Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite. These mobile CPUs are notable, according to Qualcomm, for their efficiency and performance, especially in AI tasks. Qualcomm is already claiming that its chips beat Apple's M3.\n\nThe best way for Apple to steal the thunder from Qualcomm, Microsoft, and Google is to pre-announced an AI-sporting Apple M4 and show off just a bit of its Apple AI before the first Qualcomm system ships, before Microsoft reveals big Copilot updates for Windows 12, and before Google impresses us with even more Gemini tricks.\n\nSeen through that light, Apple's rumored plans aren't that surprising at all. The iPad gets an elevated push that sets it up for a strong 2024, Apple fans and potential switchers see yet another generational performance leap in the M4, and we finally learn how Apple plans to rule the AI-obsessed world.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_event", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple M1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IMac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet_PCs", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet PCs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q2CKM6fWshyLtEQGNdDXu7-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 175, "textEnd": 180, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Tom's Guide weighs in ahead of Apple's 'Let Loose' event", "body": "In case you've been living under a rock, Apple's 'Let Loose' event is coming up on May 7, and it's all but confirmed that we will finally be seeing new iPads. I'll emphasize \"finally,\" as we haven't seen a new tablet from the Cupertino crew since 2022.\n\nNamely, we're expecting to see two drastically upgraded tablets from the Cupertino crew -- an iPad Pro (potentially with an M4 chip) and an iPad Air (coming in a larger 12.9-inch option to boot). And while the excitement levels are high, now is the best time to figure out what killer feature would make you pull the trigger and buy one.\n\nTo help with this, the Tom's Guide team has got involved, and it's fair to say we have a lot of thoughts! Let's dive in, and we'd love to hear what features you're most looking forward to hearing about in the comments.\n\nGive me a proper OS, and you can have my cash\n\nApple's iPads are, from a hardware perspective, almost perfect. The same can't be said for the software. Don't get me wrong, I was happy to see iPadOS become a thing and it's going in the right direction -- split-screen multitasking, customizable toolbars and resizable windows with Stage Manager -- but it's still too much iOS and not enough macOS for my liking.\n\nI don't expect it to ever happen, but a truly open OS for at least the iPad Pro is on my wishlist. Having the power of the M4 SoC hamstrung by iPadOS seems crazy in a world where Apple wants this device to replace your computer. Anyone wanting a decent file system or full-scale apps for software development or video production will still choose a MacBook over an iPad. What's more, the ability to install programs from outside Apple's tightly-guarded App Store could be a big plus for some.\n\nAlthough the standard iPad and the mini still serve their best purpose as content consumption devices, the Air and Pro lines are increasingly becoming work tools in their own right. It's time they deserved a proper OS upgrade to reflect that.\n\nYes, there's the Home app, but a full interface that lets me control all my smart home devices, view my home security cameras, and listen to music through my HomePod or other smart speaker would make it much more invaluable.\n\nEven better would be a way to mount it to a wall, so I could hang it up in my kitchen, much the way I use the Amazon Echo Show 15. Then, it would be so much easier to use Siri to set timers, look up recipes, and use the assistant for many more hands-free activities.\n\nAmong the big three smart home platforms, Apple is the only one without a smart display, and adding this functionality to the next iPad would make HomeKit that much more compelling for those who want to automate their home.\n\nGive it some real fitness credentials\n\nThe magic of Apple's devices is that everything works together seamlessly, and that's the key to Apple Fitness Plus, the brand's virtual workout platform. If you're an Apple Watch wearer, the data from your watch syncs to Fitness Plus so you can keep tabs on your performance in real-time. As good as it is, Apple hasn't really optimized the experience for the iPad's larger display. Instead, you get pretty much the same app as you do on your iPhone, only bigger. But there's so much more they could do.\n\nIn this year's upgrade, I'd love to see them finally add motion tracking to Fitness Plus on the iPad. It's not impossible -- BowFlex, which makes some of our favorite adjustable dumbbells, has motion tracking built into its workout app, JRNY. The app uses the front-facing cameras to analyze your movements and give guidance on your form so that you can get the most from your training. Plus, it'll also automatically count reps of any muscle-building exercise you do.\n\nThe iPad is the ideal device for a feature like this within Apple Fitness Plus, as the larger display means that you can more easily see the nuances and detail in any exercise feedback, so that you know exactly which part of the move you need to adjust and where in your body. And, with BowFlex's future currently uncertain due to its recent bankruptcy, this would add a competitive edge to Fitness Plus, especially if you could use any weights you already have at home.\n\nI want an OLED iPad so much, I could tear my hair out\n\nWhile part of me desperately wants Apple to fully \"Let Loose\" at its keynote next week, the long-rumored tablet-centric fruit that Crew Cupertino's event could bear is probably going to put a great big dent in my bank balance. One of the worst kept tech secrets is that an OLED iPad Pro is almost here. A prospect that both delights and terrifies me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm thirsting for an OLED iPad more than someone who's been forced to trek through the Sahara Desert for three weeks straight with only salted crackers. The much talked-about new iPad Pro (specifically the 12.9-inch version), is a device I've been dreaming about for years.\n\nAs much as I love my iPad Pro (2021), I've been ready to upgrade it for 18 months. While it's a wonderful tablet and its mini-LED Liquid Retina Display is fantastic, it ain't \"OLED good.\" As someone cursed with almost owl-like night vision, I can tell my tablet and its hundreds of dimming zones are faking true black when I watch the best Netflix movies at night. I need an OLED display that can turn off every pixel to give me perfect blacks, and it looks like Apple is going to grant my wish/crush my credit card next week.\n\nMagSafe is well past due\n\nOLED iPads are long overdue, but there's also another feature the iPad is sorely lacking right now -- MagSafe. We've heard rumors that Apple's magnetic charging system could come to iPad Pro this year, and that is something I am all for. It's crazy that Apple never added regular wireless charging to the iPad, but the lack of MagSafe is absolutely mind boggling. Especially given the potential benefits.\n\nThe main benefit here is the whole charging aspect. I know from experience that iOPad charging cables can get in the way, since they stick out so much. Wireless charging means a way to charge an iPad without using plug-in cable, keeping it out of sight and out of the way. And that magnetic ring ensures that the power source is always connected in the optimal spot.\n\nSince Apple has been pushing the iPad Pro as an alternative to a MacBook, there are countless ways magnetic charging can enhance the design and experience. The Magic Keyboard is already magnetic, so why not add some charging capabilities in there as well? Magnets open a huge range of opportunities for different kinds of stands and displays -- especially paired with an iPad-version of StandBy mode. It makes sense to throw charging into the mix as well.\n\nStay the course\n\nI know we're talking about what big feature would get us excited about the new iPads Apple is reportedly announcing during its \"Let Loose\" event. However, my answer is somewhat strange because I think iPads -- whether they be the iPad mini, iPad Air or iPad Pro are good enough as they are, at least for my purposes. To that end, I'm happy with Apple staying the course.\n\nI only use iPads for two main reasons: watching YouTube videos and reading comics/manga. If I want to browse the web, I'd rather do that on a laptop or phone. When I need to snap a photo, I'll use my phone -- because I absolutely refuse to do so with a tablet. I'm also not an artist, nor do I like taking notes by hand -- so those iPad features aren't useful to me either. And while the Magic Keyboard does a decent enough job of giving iPads (particularly the iPad Air and iPad Pro) laptop-like functionality, I'd rather just use a real laptop instead.\n\nWith that said, I am looking forward to a potential OLED iPad Pro and 12.9-inch iPad Air being announced on May 7. An OLED display is arguably the last major feature the company's flagship tablet needs, and a bigger iPad Air just sounds super intriguing. And if the iPad Pro does indeed pack an M4 chip as rumors now claim, that should be a huge deal (no pun intended).\n\nIt's unclear how Apple plans to update its iPads. The company could either introduce major upgrades or simply offer minor refreshes. It's hard to tell at this time, but if Apple decides not to radically alter its tablets, I won't complain very much. I welcome any potential updates but I'm also fine with iPads effectively remaining the same.\n\nJust use the chip to its full potential\n\nIf Apple puts the AI-centric M4 chip in its iPad range then that is a game changing moment for portable technology. This chip is rumored to be capable of running artificial intelligence applications at speed and with greater efficiency -- assuming they don't skimp on the RAM. The Pro models usually have 16GB RAM and that is the absolute minimum for capitalizing on the power of generative AI.\n\nYes, Apple make more efficient use of RAM than other devices, but that won't matter as much if you're trying to run Stable Diffusion 3 or Llama 3 80B on-device and hoping to get a response in under an hour. Being able to integrate and run these models on a tablet, on the move and using the output in a project is a significant moment and one only Apple can really deliver.\n\nAssuming Apple can utilize the full power of the M4 chip and provide enough RAM to be useful then the next-generation iPad Pro could well be the ultimate AI device and that is before we get to the potential iPadOS upgrades made possible by the more powerful chip. This includes deeper system customization, a more immersive -- and useful -- Spotlight and generative features in Photos.\n\nMore from Tom's Guide", "source": {"uri": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom's_Hardware", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tom's Hardware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(Apple)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fitness (Apple)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS/iPadOS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "App Store (iOS/iPadOS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePod", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HomePod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Echo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_speaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smart speaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagSafe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MagSafe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "File system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software development"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8QuqZTg0BArIq9pqpo0iAw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/toms_guide_826/d285ce1b81a6e8430f5aca931279ab82", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 83, "textEnd": 88, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Apple is planning something big at its upcoming Let Loose event on May 7. But what could they possibly be showing off? It's iPads, duh. What do you think that hand spinning the Apple Pencil signifies? It will be centered around new iPad Pros, iPad Airs, and tablet accessories. Perhaps we'll also see the first glimpse of Apple's first AI-focused product, even if the new iPad has a far more beautiful screen.\n\nApple will stream the event from its official YouTube page as well as its event website.

Based on past reports and the company's usual modus operandi, Apple is likely to get the ball rolling straight away with talk of its new iPad Pros with OLED screens and a larger, better-looking iPad Air. These tablets may also be the first devices to support an M4 chip if Bloomberg's Mark Gurman proves correct, so Apple would likely spend a chunk of time talking about the AI capabilities of these new CPUs, particularly the speeds of the NPU.\n\nAfter that, Apple will probably a few more details about the accessories for the new iPad, which will likely include a new Apple Pencil with enhanced haptic feedback and a new Magic Keyboard that sports a sturdier, aluminum frame.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/6368aae5a2f03a6e566311748ef84df4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 185, "textEnd": 190}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

When the logo is fully erased, a new variant animates in.\n\nThe latest teaser is yet another reference to the fact that we are also anticipating new generations of Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard, to coincide with the new iPads.\n\nThe new Magic Pencil is expected to add a new squeeze gesture, that may help users access eraser functionality in their drawing app more quickly. The squeeze gesture is believed to be accompanied by haptic feedback, to confirm the action.\n\nThe new Magic Keyboard will feature a new design based on aluminium case materials, with a larger trackpad to make it even more laptop-like. It's currently unclear if the new keyboard will be compatible with only the new iPad Pro, or if it will also work with the Air.\n\nThe new iPad Pro lineup will feature the same offering of two screen sizes, but the tablets will now sport new OLED display technology for richer contrast and more brightness. The new models are believed to be powered by the next-generation of Apple Silicon, M4. The Neural Engine in the M4 is expected to be significantly upgraded to be better for artificial intelligence workloads.\n\nThe overall industrial chassis design of the new iPad Pro is also believed to have been updated, with an overall thinner body. The front camera may also move to the landscape edge for the first time.\n\nThe new iPad Air is expected to be less dramatic, with a more straightforward refresh to the M2 chip.

For a limited time, save up to $425 on this iPad Pro when you trade in your old tablet. Once again, My Best Buy Plus members get 10% more on Apple trade-ins. If you get the highest trade-in value for your old tablet under your membership, you could walk away with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro M2 for as low as $529.\n\nBest Buy didn't put an expiration countdown clock on this deal, so there's no telling how long it will last.

The company has lost a large percentage of iPad market share but continues to lead by a wide margin.\n\nJust a couple of days away from the May 7 special event at which new iPad models will presumably be unveiled, Apple announced its fiscal second-quarter results with a 16.64% drop in revenue relating to sales of iPad products.\n\nThis is something logical and natural considering that Apple did not present any new iPad model throughout 2023. Below we take a look at tablet sales from Apple and other manufacturers in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nCanalys reports that Global tablet sales have increased \"modestly\" by 1% compared to the same period last year. The first quarter of 2024 has generated sales figures of 33.7 million tablets and all this despite the fact that the iPad's market share has dropped considerably.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2023 Apple obtained a market share of 42% with a wide margin of advantage over other manufacturers such as Samsung, which accounted for 20% of sales.\n\nBesides, In the first quarter of 2024, Apple sales have decreased by up to 36%. Still, the iPad continues to lead the tablet market. Samsung has maintained a 20% market share and in third place is Huawei with 8% of sales, according to Canalys data.\n\nAdditionally, the decline in Apple iPad sales translates into an annual reduction of 13.9%. In the first quarter of 2023 the company sold 13,954 units of tablets while this year, in the first quarter of 2024, it has sold 12,012 units.\n\nThe transition to OLED in Apple's iPad product portfolio will mark a turning point in the tablet market.

In addition, the corporation may introduce new-generation accessories. Here's what you can expect to see during the Apple Let Loose event.\n\nThe iPad Pro OLED is one of the most popular improvements of the year. For the first time, the company will offer OLED panels in both 12.9-inch and 11-inch variants. This should result in improved contrast, brightness, and colour precision, making it ideal for creative work or media consumption.\n\nREAD: Android 15 May Bring 'Super Dark Mode' For Users With Enhanced Optimisations; Details\n\nThe iPad Pro OLED will also have a slimmer look. According to reports, the 12.9-inch OLED variant will be 20 per cent slimmer, while the 11-inch model will be 15 per cent slimmer. Under the hood, the iPad Pro may be driven by the new M4 processor. However, there is still doubt surrounding the chipsets, with sources indicating that the company may debut the M4 for iPads first, followed by the Mac.\n\nThe refreshed iPad Air also expected to get two variants- 10.9-inch and 12.9-inch with sleeker design. Under the hood, the tablets are expected to get an M2 processor. It may feature the Landscape Front camera, reportedly 12 MP.\n\nApple is also slated to introduce the new Magic Keyboard exclusively for Pro models to give it more like a laptop feel with an aim to offer enhanced productivity and usability. On the other hand, the company may also introduce the next-genration pencil with swappable tips, Find My integration, and a \"squeeze\" gesture for additional control options.\n\nREAD: PS5 Slim Price Discounts: Gamers Will Get Rs 5,000 Off On New PlayStation 5 Slim But For Few Days\n\nAll the iPad variants are expected to be introduced with a $100 hike.

Additionally, if you're trying to buy essential iPad accessories, such as charging cables, power banks, hubs, or covers, you have to make sure you get the right ones to work with your specific device. Your iPad model will also determine things like what Apple Pencil model you should get and even how to charge it. You should especially be mindful of which model iPad you're buying when getting one second-hand, since they may no longer have warranty support.\n\nUnfortunately, finding the iPad's model can lead to some challenges.

If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale.\n\nWhen you're buying one of the best iPads, it can be tempting to just splurge on whatever the latest and greatest option is. However, as time goes on and discounts ramp up, the decision becomes a little muddier when comparing the best tablets. Because while the 10th-generation model is obviously newer, the lower price on the iPad 9th-Gen might be worth sticking with an older product at a lower cost, even if it's going to get further outdated after the Apple Event on May 7, where we're expecting to see a brand new generation of iPads.\n\nCheck out the best iPad dealsPrice\n\nThe latest iPad, the 10th-generation model, is going to set you back $449 to start, while the 9th-generation option is much cheaper at $329. The latest model does have some notable upgrades over the 9th-gen model, but is it worth more than a hundred bucks more?\n\nSplurging on the new hotness gets you an updated (and larger) display, a newer chipset, and compatability with the latest Apple Pencil. However, with so many Apple Pencil alternatives out there, this is less of a big deal than it's been in the past.\n\nAnd let's be real: Moving from the A13 Bionic to the A14 Bionic does improve performance, but not so much that you're really going to notice it in your day-to-day work. It's not like either of them is using Apple's M-class processors (at least not yet).\n\nSpecs and Features\n\nThe 9th-generation iPad has a 10.2-inch display, which had been the standard size for a while. But, with the release of the 10th-gen model, Apple removed Touch ID and added Face ID, just like it did with its phones and the more expensive iPad Pro. This didn't just affect the biometric login feature, but made more room for a screen, bumping up the display size to 10.9 inches on the iPad 10th-Gen.\n\nApple was able to do this without changing the actual size of the tablet. So in the same footprint as the 9th-generation iPad, you're getting a bigger and higher resolution display (though just barely for the latter).\n\nThe 10th-generation iPad also has a slightly more powerful processor in the A14 Bionic. This is one of the few remaining current-generation product that hasn't included an M-class chip, but it's actually built on the same microarchitecture as the Apple M1, just with 6 CPU cores instead of 8. This makes the 10th-generation iPad nearly as fast as the iPad Pro, just slightly worse at multitasking, which is fine.\n\nOn the other hand, the iPad 9th-generation is built on the A13 Bionic chip, which is also found in the iPhone 11. For most people, this is still going to be plenty powerful enough to run apps and browse the web, it might just slow down a bit under heavy use.\n\nAt the end of the day, if specs are the most important thing, you're probably going to want to go with the iPad 10th-Generation.\n\nDisplay\n\nBecause the 10th-Generation iPad eschews Touch ID in favor of Face ID, there's much more space in the frame for the display. So, while the 9th-generation iPad as a 10.2-inch display with a resolution of 2,160 x 1,620, the 10th-Generation model has a 10.9-inch display with a resolution of 2,360 x 1,640. This resolution difference was likely done just to retain the same 264 ppi that classifies it as \"Retina\".\n\nThe size is the only real difference between the two, though. Both displays are True Tone displays, with up to 500 nits of brightness. So, you're getting the same, bright colorful display either way. It's just a bit bigger on the 10th-Generation model.\n\nHonestly, while the iPad 10th-Generation is the winner here, it's only by a hair. If all you care about is having a pretty display, both iPads are going to supply. And, don't forget that the one that's just 0.7 inches smaller is much cheaper.\n\nWhich iPad Should You Buy\n\nYou're saving about the same amount of money either way, but it's hard to ignore the value of the iPad 9th-Generation at $249. It doesn't have the new silicon inside but it doesn't really matter when you're spending this little for it. Simply put, if you're on the market for a 10-inch tablet, the 9th-Generation is the clear winner in terms of value.\n\nThat's not to say the 10th-Generation isn't a good value - it is. If you were on the fence about picking up Apple's latest mainstream tablet now's about the best time to do it, even though it has been this cheap before.\n\nIf you are hesitant to pull the trigger on either iPad so early in the year, you can also wait until Black Friday 2024 where we will likely see similar or better prices.\n\nOnce you've picked up an iPad, make sure to check out our guide to the best iPad games to play on your Apple tablet.", "source": {"uri": "sea.ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN Southeast Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A14", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple A14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A13", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple A13"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touch ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple M1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biometrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer multitasking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retina display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pixel density"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Insults", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Insults", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://sm.ign.com/t/ign_ap/guide/a/apple-ipad/apple-ipad-9th-generation-vs-10th-generation-which-should-yo_wegh.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 597, "textEnd": 602}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Well, for starters, word on the street is that Apple launched the M3 later than expected (likely owing to supply chain issues), forcing the company to launch all three chips at the same event.\n\nCouple that with the fact that Microsoft is rumored to be launching its own third-party silicon at Build at the end of May, and you start to understand why the company opted not to wait. An announcement may be even more pressing, given that the Microsoft/ARM chips are said to offer \"industry-leading performance\" -- an apparent shot across Apple's bow. Could a new chip also mean new Macs? That would be a short refresh cycle for the current crop, but it's certainly not out of the realm of possibility.\n\nWhat does seem certain, however, is a new iPad Pro with an OLED display, a 12.9-inch iPad Air and new gestures for the Apple Pencil. Also, expect plenty of AI chatter. It's 2024, after all.

The tech giant's announcement is slated for May 7, 2024, according to Tech Radar.\n\nAnticipation surrounding the iPad Pro 2024 has been building, with rumours suggesting that Apple's new tablet will boast a larger display than its predecessors. While earlier speculation hinted at a 14.1-inch or 16-inch screen size, recent leaks lean towards a more modest 13-inch display, albeit with an OLED display.

One of the biggest is iPad performance outpaces the competition like Android tablets and even some PCs with less RAM. Apple can do that as it makes both the hardware and software and precisely fine-tunes its devices to perform as efficiently and powerfully as possible. Instead of focusing on specs as much as other companies, Apple focuses on what its iPads can do.\n\nHowever, in contrast to its iPhones, Apple uses different RAM on its higher-end iPads depending on how much storage it has. For example, 1TB or higher iPad Pro models come with 16 GB RAM while any iPad Pro with 512 GB or less storage has 8 GB RAM.\n\nRelated:\n\nBefore you look, can you guess how much RAM the original iPad had?\n\nOk, here's the full iPad chip list as we wait for the new iPads to arrive on May 7 \ud83d\ude01\n\nNote: An Apple News bug may cause the information below to display incorrectly.

The Best On The Market - Research Snipers", "body": "The next generation of Apple's iPad is showing signs of a development that one of the world's largest display suppliers certainly did not expect: instead of Samsung, arch-enemy LG will become the main supplier of the OLED panels for the new Apple tablets.\n\nApple wants to introduce tablets with OLED displays for the first time in a few days, after letting the entire year of 2023 go by without a single new introduction in the iPad lineup. For the first time in a long time, LG's display division has been able to achieve a small victory over the OLED leader Samsung, because Apple is probably relying exclusively on LG Display as the supplier of the panels for its new iPads.\n\nThis is reported by analyst Ross Young from Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC), who has good contacts in the supply chain. According to him, Apple is planning new iPad Pro models with 11.1- and 12.9-inch display diagonals, with which they want to leave all competitors \"far behind\". According to him, the OLED panels of the new iPad Pro are said to be the best products of their kind to date.\n\nSpecifically, according to Young, this means that Apple wants to offer LTPO technology with a maximum refresh rate of 120 Hertz, whereby the use of the \"tandem stack\" design in conjunction with special techniques for using a particularly thin design should lead to an impressive result. The panels are said to be \"ultra-thin and light\" overall but can offer enormous brightness, a longer battery life and a longer service life.\n\nLG Display was probably able to serve Apple as its main supplier primarily because Samsung also wanted to supply panels, but was unable to meet Apple's requirements. According to his sources, there were problems with Samsung panels optimizing its in-house tandem OLED design. In order not to endanger the schedule for the market launch of its new iPads, Apple chose LG as its partner.\n\nAccording to Young, Apple will unveil a total of four new tablets at its event on Tuesday. The main focus of the presentation, which is only transmitted via stream, is probably on the new iPad Pro with 11.1- and 12.9-inch OLED displays. There will also be two new iPad Air models, each with a 10.0-inch display and, for the first time, a 12.9-inch display. However, LCDs are apparently still used in these models.\n\nAccording to previous reports, Apple wants to introduce extensive AI functions for the first time with the new iPads in conjunction with the new iPadOS 17.5. In the case of the Pro models, there is an Apple M3 or even the new Apple M4 under the hood of the new devices, while the iPad Air variants should be equipped with the Apple M2 or M3.", "source": {"uri": "researchsnipers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Research Snipers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yasir_zeb@researchsnipers.com", "name": "Yasir Zeb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LG Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Display", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LG Display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-temperature_polycrystalline_silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-temperature polycrystalline silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Shopping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://researchsnipers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iPad-with-MacOS-Apple-patent-reveals-ideas-for-a-productive.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Currently, the 12.-9-inch version of the existing Pro has a mini-LED screen, while the 11-inch has an LCD one.\n\nBoth iPads Pros will also likely be thinner, with the larger model shrinking about 20 per cent in thickness and the smaller model about 15 per cent. The thinner form would require a slimmer battery, but it doesn't necessarily mean the product will have a weaker battery life as OLEDs are more energy efficient.\n\nThe new Pro models will definitely have an updated chip - although whether Apple will skip the M3 and instead go straight for the AI-capable M4 chip is a matter still up for debate.\n\nWhat isn't up for debate is that we will be seeing a new version of the Apple Pencil - the invite for the event featured an Apple Pencil. The new Pencil will likely include features such as haptic feedback that will allow users to feel a small vibration-like effect when undertaking specific actions with the stylus. Also, users will likely be able to squeeze the Pencil to conduct certain tasks.\n\nBack to the iPads, and beyond the Pro, Apple will also likely introduce for the first time a 12.9-inch version of the Air. iPad Air users will have two models to choose from themselves. These new Air models will however in all probability use the same LCD technology found in previous Air models for its screens.\n\nOne more product that we're likely to see unveiled at the event is an updated Magic Keyboard. The new version is expected to use aluminium and be more durable and will also have a larger trackpad.\n\nThe pre-recorded event will likely be a 30-minute presentation that kicks off 7am Pacific Time on Tuesday morning and can be viewed on the Apple website or even on YouTube.", "source": {"uri": "channelnews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ChannelNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "varun_godinho@channelnews.com.au", "name": "Varun Godinho", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Keyboard (Mac)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stylus (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Shopping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.channelnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chris-nagahama-vVhhfvVTerY-unsplash-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 114, "textEnd": 119}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

However, does it even need a refresh yet, and how well has it aged since our last review of the iPad Mini 6? Let's take a look at the iPad Mini 6 in this review about 2.5 years after it first came out.\n\nWhen we reviewed the iPad Mini 6 in December 2021, we had few complaints and mostly liked everything about it, be it the build quality, the performance, the speakers, or the cameras. However, that review came out two months after we bought the device, and 2.5 years later, our opinions have definitely changed.\n\nThe iPad mini 6 still feels like a solidly built tablet. I personally switched to the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra earlier this year, and it's a much bigger and more expensive tablet. Even when compared to that, the iPad Mini 6 didn't feel lagging behind in terms of the build. It still feels as premium as it did on day one, 1 and I would say it has also aged well in this area. The form factor is still impressive to this date, resulting in ease for typing, watching videos and more.\n\nThe touch ID, however, is still plagued with the same issue it had back then, and that's how inaccurate it is in detection of my fingerprint. It does work well when it has to but often, I find myself unlocking the tablet with the 4-digit PIN instead. That way, I don't have to go through the painful and annoying process of removing and keeping my fingerprint on the button time and again until it detects the print. Often, it fails to identify and anyways disables the ID, therefore asking me to unlock with the PIN.\n\nThe Apple Pencil 2 magnets have also held up well, but the pencil itself hasn't. It does have some marks on it and has also left some on the side of the iPad it attaches itself to. The speakers, as I said in my former review, have the punch and sound quite decent but I feel they could have been louder.\n\nThe IPS LCD display on the front possesses great colours and is sharp with text and other content. Now that I am used to the AMOLED panel of the Tab S9 Ultra, for obvious reasons, the panel on the iPad Mini 6 doesn't look equally good. Even for the price Apple is selling this iPad at, its high time it switches to an OLED panel but as per leaks, that seems to be reserved only for the Pro models for now and not even for the iPad Air.\n\nIf not a better panel, Apple can at least increase the Refresh Rate but considering how the brand has been adamant about the decisions it makes, that would also be an impractical expectation to keep, for now.\n\nThe iPad Mini 6 is powered by Apple's A15 Bionic chip with a 6\u00e2\u20ac'core CPU, 5-core graphics and 16-core Neural Engine. Before I move ahead, I'll quote what I said in my initial review of the iPad Mini 6 with regards to its performance. I said, \"As far as performance is concerned, this tablet is a powerhouse. It handles everything you throw at it with ease. Be it gaming or a CPU heavy task, the iPad Mini 6 just gets through it like a beast. There were no lags or anything as such and even gaming on the tablet was as fun as I had expected it to be\".\n\nAbout 2.5 years later, I cannot stand by the statement as the performance on the iPad Mini 6 has continuously deteriorated since then. While the initial updates made it smoother, the iPadOS 16 update made things worse a year after the launch of the Mini 6. The device is still capable of handling tasks well, thanks to the powerful chip, but the software begins to struggle as soon as you put some load on the CPU, paired with a good amount of heating as well.\n\nThe iPad Mini 6 never heated in the initial year but it did begin to get uncomfortably hot at the lower left part after the first major iPadOS update. If that wasn't enough, Safari would constantly freeze up on me while I used it and the tablet would then begin to heat up. Alongside frequent freezes, I have also faced circumstances that I can clearly describe as lagging, as the tablet would simply start behaving like a sub-Rs 15,000 tablet at times where the App would open after a 5-second delay after I clicked on the icon.\n\nAs far as software is concerned, the tablet hasn't really aged well. Considering its Apple, one would expect the tablet to run smoothly as it's still the latest the company offers in the mini lineup but unfortunately, that isn't the case.\n\nThe cameras on the back and front work as they should. Aside from that, the battery life has dropped significantly and that's a given, taking into consideration my charging habits where I would charge it from 30% to 100% on a daily basis. It can't last a day with heavy use and would go down below 20% by afternoon if constantly in use. Currently, with moderate use, it can stretch up to 24 hours but with the same type of usage, I could easily get past the 2-day mark till December 2022, post which the battery backup began to fall.\n\nApple is all set to introduce new iPads tomorrow, but that may not include the mini, according to leaks. However, leaks suggest that iPad mini is still set to get a refresh later this year and I wish Apple would make some necessary changes this year to the iPad Mini 7.\n\nEven though the iPad Mini 7 is rumoured to get a chip upgrade only, it does need a better display that's sharper and has a higher resolution, due to the higher price of the tablet as the current panel doesn't match the standard of the competition. Aside from that, I feel Apple should give the iPad Mini 7 the latest A-series chip if not the M-series, like it did with the iPad Air.\n\nThe newer chip would result in a better performance which is much needed so the iPad Mini ages well it due course of time. The software optimisation also has to be handled in a better manner. Finally, an upgrade to the touch ID would be appreciated along with a bigger battery as well.", "source": {"uri": "themobileindian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mobile Indian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhishek_malhotra@themobileindian.com", "name": "Abhishek Malhotra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Mini", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad Mini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S9", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy S9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A15", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple A15"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pencil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPS panel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A11", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple A11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS_16", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS 16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.themobileindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ipad-mini6-review.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

One of the unusual aspects of the event is that there are three places instead of one where Apple has called the press simultaneously: New York, Toronto and London. La Vanguardia will be present in the latter, in the new Apple offices in the iconic Battersea Power Station building, the old power station next to the Thames (today a spectacular shopping center) that illustrated the cover of Pink Floyd's historic album Animals ( 1977) and its Remix edition from 2018.\n\nOther elements that make this event unusual. A big presentation in May, four weeks before the start of the WWDC developer conference to be held in Cupertino (California) on June 10, is not part of Apple's usual canons, because this last event often represents the ramp launch of several new features. Last year, the highlight was the announcement of the Vision Pro spatial computing viewer. It would have made sense for the new iPads to arrive in just over a month. Or maybe not.\n\nTwo elements may have influenced Apple's decision to hold the presentation in three locations where the specialized press will be able to test its new products up close at the end of the event. First of all, the inauguration of WWDC is very focused on artificial intelligence, which will be part of the company's new operating systems, probably with models of a size that work within each device, without the need to connect to external servers. , which will imply speed, personalization and privacy, but also good data processing capacity.\n\nOn the other hand, the need to incorporate advanced artificial intelligence functions in all its devices starting in the fall would imply that the iPads, about to be renewed, would also carry a chip with more cores in their neural engine. At this point, Bloomberg's leak that Apple plans to incorporate a new M4 chip into its iPad Pro, just six months after announcing the M3, could be a reason for an event dedicated especially to it. At WWDC it could be detailed how this AI will work. For example, with Siri.\n\nAside from all that, the news on iPad could be important. Apple has been trying for many years for its tablet to become the main computer for many professional uses. It has partially achieved this in some sectors, but despite the power of its machines, it is still awaiting that leap. The iPad Pro, in addition to chips like the M4 (or M3 if it doesn't arrive), could this time incorporate an OLED screen, which would make them thinner. The sizes of 11 and 12.9 inches would remain.\n\nIt would also be followed by a new generation of iPad Air, Apple's mid-range tablets, in some aspects, from design to processor, almost indistinguishable from the Pro models. The Air could also debut a new large size of 12.9 inches in addition to the 11 inch model. The new generation of tablets is also expected to have a new Magic Keyboard. But the accessory that is safest that we will see is the Apple Pencil, of which a new generation would arrive, as shown in one of the logos of the event.\n\nThe London presentation will be at the Battersea Power Station, a former power station that is part of the London skyline, the star of Pink Floyd's album covers, and which was also the largest brick building in the world. Since last year, Apple has had its London design offices in this emblematic building.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [],

The last thing you want is to purchase the wrong accessories for your devices. Also, confirm the iPhone or iPad model number when purchasing a used device. Unlike Android OEMs, Apple only makes incremental design changes, and it can be tricky to guess the correct iPhone or iPad model at first glance. Here's how to determine the device model, whether you have the latest iPhone or a second-hand iPad.\n\nRelated 7 things you'll hate about switching from Android to iOS Don't even get us started on the notifications\n\nCheck your iPhone or iPad model name\n\nThere are several ways to find your iPhone or iPad model name. Let's start with the easiest one. It's also the easiest way to determine which iPhone or iPad you own.\n\nUse the system settings app\n\nYou don't need a third-party hack or software to check your iPhone or iPad model name. The option is built into the Settings app.\n\nWe use screenshots from the iPhone. The steps are the same on an iPad.\n\nOpen Settings on your iPhone or iPad. Scroll to General. Select About. Close Glance over the iPhone or iPad model name from the following menu. Close\n\nWhen you check the model number on an iPad, it shows the model name with size and generation. We followed the steps on our iPad Pro. Check the screenshot below for reference.\n\nUse another Apple device\n\nAnother trick to finding your iPhone or iPad model number is to check your account details from System Settings and glance over the connected devices to your Apple account. We use an iPad as an example.\n\nOpen Settings and go to your account. Scroll down to your devices. Find your iPhone or iPad model. Tap the model for details like OS version, serial number, and IMEI.\n\nUnlike the trick above, you won't find the exact iPad model. In our case, the system referred to our tablet as iPad Pro.\n\nCheck the Apple account on the web\n\nIf you can't access another device, use Apple Web to check your devices.\n\nVisit Apple Web and sign in with your account details. Select Devices from the sidebar and find your iPhone or iPad model.\n\nConnect your iPhone or iPad to a PC or Mac\n\nYou can connect your device to a PC or Mac and find the device model from iTunes or the Finder menu.\n\nConnect an iPhone or iPad to a Mac or PC using the supplied data cable. Open Finder and find your device under the Locations menu. Check your device model at the top.\n\nDetermine your iPhone or iPad model number\n\nYou can also note the iPhone or iPad model number and match it on Apple's website to find the model name.\n\nCheck device settings\n\nOpen Settings and scroll to General. Select About. Find your device model number. It may show a random number with alphabeticals. The number usually starts with M, N, F, or P. Tap it to reveal the actual number. In our case, it was A2377 on an iPad and A2849 on an iPhone. Close\n\nFind the model number on the back of the device\n\nIf you have an old iPhone or iPad model, flip the device to find the model number on the back. This trick only works on iPhone 7 or earlier models.\n\nCheck the SIM tray\n\nApple stopped printing the device model number on the back to give it a clean look. Instead, the company engraves the number on the SIM. Ensure good lighting conditions, use the SIM injector tool, and find the model number on the top side of the display.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nCheck the charging port\n\nIf your iPhone only supports eSIM, look for the device model number on the Lightning or USB-C port. You'll find the number on the top side of the connector.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nUse your iPhone or iPad model number\n\nWhen you find your iPhone or iPad model number, navigate to the Apple support page for iPhone or iPad and find your model number. Use the Find function to type the model number and find the model quickly.\n\nConfirm your iPhone or iPad model number\n\nAs you can see from the list above, finding your iPhone or iPad model doesn't require rocket science. You should mainly use the Settings app to determine which iPhone you own. If you recently switched from Android to iPhone, go through the required changes to make yourself feel at home.", "source": {"uri": "androidpolice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Police"}, "authors": [{"uri": "parth_shah@androidpolice.com", "name": "Parth Shah", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Original equipment manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screenshot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESIM", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESIM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SIM card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_7", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone 7"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_(connector)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lightning (connector)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITunes"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Models", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Models", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Models", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats_and_Ships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats and Ships", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1-7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541713", "eventUri": "eng-9541713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

We call it Apple Breakfast because we think it goes great with a Monday morning cup of coffee or tea, but it's cool if you want to give it a read during lunch or dinner hours too.\n\nApple started running virtual press events during the pandemic when in-person gatherings made little sense and at various times were frowned upon or literally illegal. But Apple has largely stuck with that format even as health concerns lessened and its own employees were herded back into the office. Why is that? Because virtual events have advantages far beyond the containment of disease.\n\nAside from avoiding the logistical headaches of getting a thousand bad-tempered journalists from around the world to the same place at the same time, a pre-recorded video presentation is much easier to run smoothly than a live performance. Remember when Craig Federighi introduced Face ID and the phone refused to unlock? Or when Steve Jobs' clicker didn't work? We'd never have seen those or any number of other gaffes if Apple had the ability to do another take or recreate the process with CGI. Pre-recorded keynotes are not immune to embarrassing errors of judgment, but they happen a lot less.\n\nNobody cringes harder than me when live performers get things wrong, and I absolutely get the attraction of virtual keynotes for Apple. But it does raise some awkward existential questions about why we need to bother with the elaborate charade that is a keynote presentation.\n\nWhat, after all, is the point of a keynote? If it's just to get information about new products, that can be done far more efficiently via a press release that you can read at your own speed; just the facts, no sitting through skits and corporate self-congratulation. Is it to be marketed by the best hypemen in the business? If that's really something you want, you might as well get it from an ad: virtual keynotes give none of that dubious excitement and tribalistic sense of inclusivity you get with a live performance. And we've even lost the stress-test element of seeing an executive operating the product under extreme pressure.\n\nWhat we're left with is a strange hybrid: a long press release read out by a series of charisma-free executives, interspersed with advertisements. Which is fine, provided the information is at least worth the effort. But as far as tomorrow's Let Loose event goes, the signs are not promising. It looks a lot like Apple wanted to use its spring 2024 event to launch both iPads and MacBooks but had to hold back the iPads as a result of production delays, and during the wait, the MacBooks were released via a quiet press release. Has anything new appeared in the meantime to fill the stage/screen time that would have been devoted to laptops? Perhaps. And perhaps not, in which case we'll be getting an awful lot of filler about environmental policy.\n\nIt's possible that Apple will come up with a surprise announcement Tuesday to blow our socks off: 2nd-gen AirPods Max, a new HomePod with a screen, or a revamped version of Siri that's actually smart. Even a new standard iPad or iPad mini would be somewhat interesting. But it seems likely we'll just get a new iPad Air (including a new larger-screen model), a new iPad Pro (with a fancy OLED screen and either an M3 or M4 processor), a new overpriced Magic Keyboard, and yet another Apple Pencil with a squeeze gesture. And a lot of viewers will wish Apple had saved us all the bother and sent out an email.\n\nThis week, Apple is holding an event dubbed \"Let Loose.\" So what new products will Apple introduce on May 7?

If the boy or girl has an iPad and you don't know what to give, we suggest some accessories to get more out of your Apple tablet.\n\nWe start with the UGREEN magnetic stand (49.99 euros), compatible with 12.9-inch iPad Pros from the third generation. Integra Powerful magnets to securely hold your Apple tablet. It has a stable and resistant hinge, as well as a base that can be rotated 360\u00ba for maximum versatility. When it is not in use it can be folded so that it does not take up much space.\n\niPads are much better with accessories. If the person has the 10th generation iPad, the Logitech Combo Touch (145.21 euros) gives them \"superpowers.\" This is a well-spaced backlit keyboard case with a row of removable iPadOS shortcut keys, in addition to incorporating a Gesture-enabled trackpad for precision. It does not use batteries or battery, since it connects through the Smart Connector and takes advantage of the energy of the tablet.\n\nOne of the big drawbacks of the iPad is the lack of connectivity or ports, but models with USB-C can easily solve this with the SATECHI Hub Pro (59.99 euros). This compact accessory provides a 3.5 mm headphone jack connection, 4K HDMI to connect to a monitor or televisionUSB-A 3.0 and also a USB-C for charging.\n\nThe Apple Pencil is one of the best iPad accessories, especially for students and artists, but its price is quite high. Luckily there are cheaper alternatives, such as the Logitech Crayon with USB-C (59 euros), which implements Apple stylus technologies. Its autonomy is around 6.5 hours of writingit automatically rejects the palm of the hand and is also able to adjust the thickness of the line according to the inclination.\n\nApple tablets can be used as digital notebooks with a stylus like the previous one from Logitech, but writing on the glass can be strange, so there are screen protectors like the ESR Paper-Feel (21.99 euros) that, in addition , it is magnetic (this model is only compatible with the iPad 10). Its specially treated surface provides a good drawing surfaceand when you don't want to use it, it can be easily disassembled and reused later.\n\nYou can be up to date and informed at all times of all the news from the Apple world and Applesfera Selecci\u00f3n offers in our profiles.

As Apple's top tablet, it has a strong battery.\n\nThe 11-inch model has a 7538mAh battery, while the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro has a 10,758mAh battery. Apple says both can last a full day on one charge.\n\nBut many people find these large batteries don't last as long as they expect.\n\nThey say the iPad Pro uses up its battery quicker than they thought. Maybe you've noticed this too, leading you to look for solutions online.\n\nThis article will help you find out the problem and fix it. Let's begin the troubleshooting process.\n\nYou might have tried this old trick before, but if not, it often fixes many iPad problems.\n\nTurning off your iPad stops many background activities that drain the battery.\n\nYou can also reboot the system to get the same result.\n\nTo turn off, restart, or reboot your iPad Pro, either go to Settings to shut it down or press the volume and top buttons at the same time until the Apple logo shows.\n\nIf this fixes the issue, it's likely an issue with the iPad's functions, not the battery. If it doesn't work, move on to the next step.\n\nSometimes, a fast battery drain on your iPad might just show how much you use it.\n\nTo find out if your high usage is draining the battery quickly, shut all apps and browsers and record the battery level. Wait 30 minutes and check the battery again.\n\nIf there is a big decrease in the battery percentage, it means one of two things: the battery might need replacing, or you might need to change some settings.\n\nIf the battery is bad, you need to call Apple.\n\nHowever, if your iPad is still new, you should change some settings to help the battery last longer. Check the settings below.\n\nAn app might be using your iPad's battery without you knowing. It could be working in the background.\n\nTo check, go to Settings and click on Battery.\n\nYou will see which apps are using a lot of battery. If you don't use these apps anymore, you can delete them.\n\nIf you use these apps often but they drain the battery, you can turn them off so they don't run in the background.\n\nAfter doing this, it's a good idea to restart your iPad to ensure it runs smoothly.\n\nApps that keep updating in the background use your iPad's battery. If your battery is fine, you can leave it as is.\n\nBut, if your battery runs out fast, turning off this feature can help a lot.\n\nYour apps will still function, but they will only update when you open them. Here's how to disable this feature.\n\nThe more light your iPad's screen shows, the more power it uses. You usually don't need a very bright screen, except in daylight.\n\nSo, turning down the brightness or using Dark Mode can help your battery last longer.\n\nTo lower your iPad Pro's screen brightness and switch to Dark Mode, follow these steps:\n\nThe Auto-lock feature on your iPad locks your device automatically if you haven't used it for a while.\n\nThis locks your screen and saves battery by turning off functions you're not using.\n\nI recommend setting the Auto-lock to 5 minutes. This allows you enough time to decide if you need to use your iPad again.\n\nLocation services use a lot of battery power on iPads. They work with GPS to find your precise location.\n\nThis feature is very helpful, but you might not always need it.\n\nAlso, not every app requires location services. You can save battery by turning it off for apps that don't use it. Here's how:\n\nOpen the Settings on your iPad and go to Privacy.\n\nBluetooth and WiFi make using an iPad enjoyable.

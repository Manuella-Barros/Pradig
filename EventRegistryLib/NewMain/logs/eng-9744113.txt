With his win virtually certain, Udhayanidhi proceeded to campaign across the state, brandishing at rallies a brick to underline how the previous AIADMK-BJP government had failed to complete work on the promised AIIMS-Madurai.\n\nSeveral months after the DMK came to power and his father M K Stalin became the CM, Udhayanidhi was inducted as a minister, with the portfolios of Welfare and Sports Development.\n\nUdhayanidhi's profile has since been on the rise within the party, with DMK social media handles covering him faithfully, particularly his visits to his constituency. In preparation of this widening role in the government, he has curtailed his movie career, with last year's well-received Maamannan talked about as perhaps his last as an actor, though he still runs one of South India's most prominent film companies.\n\nThis rise and rise has not been without its share of detractors, especially in a party that swears by its ideological moorings. While late DMK veteran M Karunanidhi first opened party doors to the family, accommodating both his sons (Stalin, M Alagiri) and his daughter (Kanimozhi), he had ensured that they kept away from the spotlight as long as he was himself physically active in politics.\n\nWhat has changed, however, is that power within the DMK is now entirely concentrated under Stalin, meaning that this latest promotion for Udhaynidhi is unlikely to face much dissent. Where he faced stiff challenge for a long time from elder brother Alagiri in the tussle for Karunanidhi's legacy, Stalin is now the uncontested leader of the DMK, while Alagiri's son Dayanidhi gets along very well with Udhayanidhi.\n\nA relative told The Indian Express earlier, around the time that Udhayanidhi was made a minister, that he was anyway hardly a \"novice\". \"He is an elected MLA who has been in the game since a long time. He is not a nominated member like some others,\" the relative said. Others close to the family point out how Udhayanidhi held out being made a minister for months after Stalin became CM.\n\nNow though he is said to have pushed to be made Deputy CM before Stalin takes a break, ending the general belief once that he was not politically ambitious, and that mother Durga had pushed his case.\n\nThe 46-year-old is married to Kiruthiga, who has interests in fashion, publication and film and documentary production.\n\nThere is a whiff of controversy about these parallel interests of Udhayanidhi and family, with the 2006-11 DMK regime facing accusations of trying to monopolise the film industry, with control over production, distribution, exhibition and sale of film rights. Little has changed since, with Udhayanidhi's Red Giant Movies considered the last word in the Tamil Nadu film industry now.\n\nUdhayanidhi is also shadowed by allegations around his powerful brother-in-law Sabareesan, a key behind-the-scenes figure in the DMK government.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arun_janardhanan@indianexpress.com", "name": "Arun Janardhanan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Stalin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Karunanidhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

This move is similar to that of his father, MK Stalin, who became Deputy CM after the 2009 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nDMK's youth wing leader and MLA from Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni constituency, Udhayanidhi, was sworn-in as a minister of the DMK cabinet in December 2022.\n\nAccording to the sources, Udhayanidhi was supposed to be made Deputy CM twice this year. But, hit by controversies, DMK's plans didn't work out.\n\nIn January this year, the plan to make him Deputy CM was dropped due to the Sanatana Dharma controversy and later due to the Kallakurichi hooch tragedy.\n\nThe Sanantana Dharma controversy erupted in the month of January after Udhayanidhi likened Sanatana Dharma with \"malaria\" and \"dengue\" while calling for its eradication. The DMK minister argued that Sanatana Dharma is based on the caste system and discrimination.\n\nHis statement sparked widespread criticism, leading to several complaints and the Supreme Court's intervention.\n\nMeanwhile, the DMK government has once again received flak due to the Kallakurichi hooch tragedy, that occurred in the month of June. At least 65 people died after drinking spurious liquor in Kallakurichi district.\n\nHowever, highly-placed sources said both Chief Minister MK Stalin and Udhayanidhi Stalin are yet to make a final decision on this. Following DMK's victory in the Vikravandi by-election last week, there has been a strong buzz within DMK circles about the possible elevation of Udhayanidhi ahead of the chief minister's proposed visit to the US in the third week of August.\n\nA state-level party leader, close to the top leadership, said the party functionaries' expectation of Udhayanidhi being elevated to the deputy CM post is not new, as many MLAs have expressed the same sentiment during assembly sessions. Emphasising that the final decision rests with the leadership, he said, \"To the best of my knowledge, neither Udhayanidhi nor the leadership has arrived at any decision as of Thursday evening.\"\n\nAnother senior leader shared the CM invited around 10 ministers to his home on Tuesday to discuss strategies for the 2026 assembly election and ways to strengthen the party. News of this meeting also fuelled the speculation that Udhayanidhi elevation is likely soon.\n\nDMK sources said the party leadership had almost made the decision to elevate Udhayanidhi last November. However, the plan was put in storage after a survey by a political strategy team close to the DMK found the public opinion to be unfavourable.\n\nPointing out that Udhayanidhi was made a youth wing's state secretary as a reward and honour for his contribution to the party's success in the 2019 parliament election, party sources said there was expectation that he would be elevated after the party's landslide victory in the 2024 parliament election.\n\nWith the party following it up with a thumping victory in Vikravandi bypoll as well, DMK leaders and cadre are eagerly monitoring the developments with hope.", "source": {"uri": "asianlite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local News for British Asian and Indian Community in London"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deputy_chief_ministers_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of deputy chief ministers of Maharashtra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udhayanidhi_Stalin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Udhayanidhi Stalin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hinduism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kallakurichi_district", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kallakurichi district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._K._Stalin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "M.

Chief Minister M K Stalin's son and a minister in his cabinet, Udhayanidhi Stalin is expected to be anointed as the Deputy Chief Minister, formalising his position as the number two in the government and the party.\n\nThe buzz about cabinet reshuffle and an expansion, ahead of Stalin's foreign tour to the United States on August 22, has acquired added significance with this long expected coronation of the DMK's crown prince. Also on the anvil, DMK sources said, is the return of PTR Palanivel Thiagarajan as the Finance Minister replacing incumbent Thangam Thennarasu.\n\nOnly in January this year, Stalin had scotched rumours of his son's elevation as Deputy CM. After addressing the DMK Youth Wing Conference in Salem, a massive show of Udhayanidhi, the Chief Minister maintained that it was not in the cards. But, this time around sources in the government and the party maintain that the time has come.\n\n\"There is pressure from the party on the Chief Minister to formalise Udhayanidhi's position as the second in command by making him the Depuy CM. Senior leaders too have favoured this in view of the 2026 assembly elections. However, it is up to the Chief Minister to take a decision,\" reasoned DMK spokesperson TKS Elangovan.\n\nThe party's Gen-Next face, Udhayanidhi (47) is currently holding the portfolios of Youth Welfare, Sports Development and Special Programmes Implementation. He is also Secretary of the party's Youth Wing.\n\nFrom being a Kollywood star, running a successful film production company, Red Giants, he took the plunge into electoral politics in the 2021 assembly poll and was elected from the Chepauk-Tiruvallikeni constituency in Chennai. His elevation as a minister came on December 22. Now, the question is whether Stalin could postpone his son's eventual coronation. For, his father and the late DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi, had inducted him in the cabinet only when Stalin was in his late 50s, and then as Deputy CM in 2009.\n\nMoreover, the patriarch had not let him take the mantle of the party till his death in 2018.\n\nDebunking the charge of dynastic succession, DMK leaders explain that the impending elevation was intended to reduce the burden on the Chief Minister and share the responsibilities. And there is unanimity in the party that this should not be delayed since the next assembly election is just a year and half away.\n\nApart from Stalin, it is Udhayanidhi who remains the star campaigner of the party. There is none to challenge his position. But, actor Vijay who had launched his political party, Tamilaga Vetri Kazhagam (TVK) preparing to enter the fray in 2026 and the Tamil Nationalist 'Naam Tamilar Katchi' of Seeman gaining significant electoral strength, the DMK requires to enhance the stature of Udhayanidhi to steer the party in the future.\n\nDMK observers and analysts who say that this is on expected lines are however skeptical of any immediate elevation given Stalin too had to wait for his time for long.\n\n\"The party is in the firm grip of the DMK's first family. And, it is the family that calls the shots. None in the party would oppose this elevation, but neither would there be undue pressure. Most of the party veterans have ensured that their wards are either MPs or MLAs. But, it is for Stalin to decide. Conceding this might give room for rumours about the CM's health,\" explains R Thirunavukkarasu, teaching sociology at the University of Hyderabad, a keen observer of the Dravidian movement.\n\n\"We should not forget how Stalin had to wait despite his father being five-time Chief Minister,\" he quipped.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udhayanidhi_Stalin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Udhayanidhi Stalin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Stalin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palanivel_Thiagarajan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palanivel Thiagarajan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thangam_Thennarasu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thangam Thennarasu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._K._Stalin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

As the son of current CM MK Stalin, he is seen as the political heir of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) that his grandfather, former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Dr Kalaignar Karunanidhi, founded in 1949. Thus, this news is not surprising - it's only a matter of when. (Also Read: 5 facts about Udhayanidhi Stalin who is likely to be Tamil Nadu deputy chief minister)\n\nIn 2018, when MK Stalin handed over the baton of DMK youth wing secretary (which he held for 30 years) to Udhayanidhi in 2019 after the demise of Karunanidhi, the 40-year-old was officially inducted into the DMK though he had been campaigning for elections for many years. But the 46-year-old's path to politics is unlike his father's as he first became a Tamil film producer, then an actor and eventually an MLA in 2021.\n\nFor someone who hails from a strong political family in the Tamil state, Udhayanidhi's interest in Tamil cinema is not new as his grandfather Kalaignar Karunanidhi had penned around 75 scripts for films and was highly respected in the film industry. In fact, he earned the sobriquet Kalaignar (artist) thanks to his excellent penmanship, be it cinema scripts or political speeches. And in 2008, Udhayanidhi set up his production house Red Giant Movies producing his first film, Kuruvi, starring Thalapathy Vijay and Trisha. Red Giant Movies became a renowned name in the Tamil film industry as it also ventured into the distribution business in the state. Till date, the company has produced around 20 films, most of which star Udhayanidhi himself.\n\nNow, why did the political scion become an actor? In an interview several years ago, the actor-turned-politician stated that he wanted to be an actor so he could reach out to the masses and he was also clear that he didn't have to prove anything to anyone. This is not a new strategy he adopted given that Tamil cinema has produced numerous chief ministers and politicians, including MG Ramachandran, J Jayalalithaa, Vijayakanth, Khushbu and Kamal Haasan. In fact, cinema has been the route for those aspiring for a political career in south India.\n\nThe huge box office success of Udhayanidhi's first comic caper, Oru Kal Oru Kannadi in 2018, possibly surprised him. In an interview in 2022, he had stated, \"After OKOK, I thought I'll stop acting as it will make me the only actor with a 100 per cent success rate.\" But he went on to star in around 17 more films with Maamannan being his sign off from cinema. His decade-long film career had its ups and downs as not all his films were box office superhits. If Manithan, Psycho, Nenjukku Needhi, Kalaga Thalaivan and Maamannan were loved by the audience, his other films like Nimir and Kannai Nambathey did above average business.\n\nThroughout his acting career, he was very conscious about the kind of dialogues he mouthed on screen. Udhayanidhi never wanted to speak vulgar lines and was conscious of politically-shaded dialogues too. Udhay had said, \"I do tell my directors that I don't want certain aspects like excessive violence or double-meaning dialogues. But I don't force them to change the script.\" And as for sexism in cinema, he believed that one should avoid sexism in films. \"Good films have been made without it. But unfortunately, the masses expect glamour in a film. That's the conundrum for filmmakers, I guess. I'm trying to avoid it in my films,\" he had commented.\n\nWhen asked how he was juggling his career of producer, politician and actor at the time of Maamannan's shoot in November 2022, Udhayanidhi stated, \"As a politician-MLA, I am dedicated to the people. During the Covid lockdowns, I focused completely on my political work and then shooting resumed. I have teams to manage all the different aspects but I started becoming choosy about the scripts because I wanted to focus on the party work. I am an MLA and DMK Youth Wing Secretary. So, I need to focus on the party work and the people.\"\n\nIn a sudden turn of events, Udhayanidhi was appointed Minister for Youth Welfare and Sports Development by his father, TN CM MK Stalin, in December 2022 and it was clear that movies were likely to take a backseat now. When Maamannan released in June 2023, it became a blockbuster and Udhayanidhi was hailed for his acting skills. But by then he had become an inherent part of the DMK and the TN government and it was then he decided to hang up his acting boots and focus solely on his political career.\n\nAs soon as Udhayanidhi made this announcement, there was a lot of chatter about his production house Red Giant Movies and how this could be a conflict of interest. Red Giant Movies was being openly criticised in the film industry for having a monopoly on the film distribution business in the state. In July, Udhayanidhi informed the media that he was no longer actively part of the company and had resigned. Though he may not be actively involved in the day-to-operations of the production, distribution and exhibition house, he is still perceived as the founder and owner of the company.\n\nThe change in power dynamics within Kalaignar Karunanidhi's extended family post his demise and the appointment of MK Stalin as DMK President and TN CM has paved the way for Udhayanidhi's rise within the DMK as well as in Tamil Nadu politics. With Tamil star Vijay also announcing his political entry with his party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam, and ambition to become TN CM, all eyes are on the TN Assembly elections in 2026 when it will be a direct face-off between him and DMK heir Udhayanidhi Stalin.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Karunanidhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M.

At 46, he gained recognition during a state-wide tour, drawing enthusiastic crowds.\n\nHis political career escalated further during the 2021 Assembly elections when he won from the safe seat of Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni in Chennai. Campaigning extensively across Tamil Nadu, Udhayanidhi highlighted the AIADMK-BJP government's failures, wielding a symbolic brick at rallies to emphasise unfulfilled promises like AIIMS-Madurai.\n\nFollowing the DMK's electoral success and his father MK Stalin assuming the CM role, Udhayanidhi was appointed minister with portfolios in Welfare and Sports Development. His prominence within the party has grown, supported by DMK's active social media coverage of his constituency visits. Transitioning towards a larger governmental role, he scaled back his film career, marking the well-received \"Maamannan\" as potentially his final acting endeavor, while managing one of South India's leading film companies, the Indian Express reported.\n\nDespite his ascent, Udhayanidhi faces criticism, particularly within a party that values ideological adherence. Unlike the era when late DMK leader M Karunanidhi kept family members out of the limelight, power now concentrates firmly under Stalin's leadership. This consolidation minimises dissent over Udhayanidhi's recent elevation to Deputy CM, once a contested position amidst familial rivalries for Karunanidhi's legacy.\n\nMarried to Kiruthiga, known for her interests in fashion, publication and film, Udhayanidhi navigates controversies tied to familial interests in the film industry, echoing past accusations of industry control during the 2006-11 DMK regime. His film company, Red Giant Movies, remains influential in Tamil Nadu's cinematic landscape.\n\nDespite these challenges, Udhayanidhi's political acumen is affirmed by his tenure as an elected MLA and strategic delay in assuming ministerial responsibilities. His rise reflects familial and party dynamics under Stalin's leadership, amidst ongoing scrutiny over familial influence within the DMK government, including his brother-in-law Sabareesan's behind-the-scenes role.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adan_khan@news9live.com", "name": "Adan Khan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udhayanidhi_Stalin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Udhayanidhi Stalin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Indian_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 Indian general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_wing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Youth wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maamannan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maamannan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Karunanidhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M.

Presently he is Tamil Nadu's youth welfare and sports development minister.\n\nDMK party sources indicate that he is likely to be elevated before August 11. Party insiders are indicating that this decision was taken in line with the DMK's 'first family' tradition that M K Stalin became Deputy Chief Minister after the 2009 Lok Sabha elections in his father's Karunanidhi's cabinet.\n\nIn Indian politics though it may be common that a son or daughter plays a crucial power center in the cabinet of their parents, a son becoming deputy chief minister in a father's cabinet is only an exception. There were only two such examples before us. Both the incidents took place in 2009 only.\n\nThe first such move was made by Punjab Chief Minister and Shiromani Akali Dal chief minister Prakash Singh Badal by making his son as Deputy Chief MInister on January 21, 2009. However, as he failed to be elected to the assembly within six months of stipulated time, he resigned in the month of July, 2009.\n\nLater, in the month of August, 2009, Karunanidhi elevated his son M K Stalin, who was already a minister in his cabinet as the deputy chief minister. Udhayanidhi said to be pushed for the promotion to gain \"larger acceptance\" within the government and to become next Chief Minister of the state. But, already he is known as the 'defacto' Chief Minister of the state, playing a key role in the government.\n\nEarlier, in Telangana also during KCR regime his son K T Rama Rao being a member of his father cabinet became a crucial power center, though he was not named as 'deputy chief minister'. Likewise, in Andhra Pradesh, Nara Lokesh is also emerging as a major power center in his father N Chandrababu Naidu's cabinet.\n\nIt is interesting to note that onli in January 2024, CM Stalin spoke about the rumors around his son's promotion, describing them as unfounded and calling them \"handiwork of rivals\". Stalin had also quoted Udhayanidhi's words that all ministers in the cabinet, including him, were \"working as deputies to the CM\".\n\nThe 46-year-old Udhayanidhi is also known for his influential film company Red Giants, which has a large stake in the production and distribution of Tamil and other South Indian films.", "source": {"uri": "andhrawatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Andhrawatch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udhayanidhi_Stalin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Udhayanidhi Stalin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._K._Stalin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M.

His final film before fully transitioning into politics was Maamannan. In December 2022, he was appointed Minister for Youth Welfare and Sports Development by his father.

Udhayanidhi's statement comes against the backdrop of speculations that he might be elevated as deputy chief minister. Udhayanidhi, who has been youth wing secretary since 2019 and minister since Dec 2022, has neither confirmed nor refuted speculations in his statement.\n\nHe said fascist elements are waiting to reap political dividends by inciting caste and communal hatred as they are unable to digest Tamil Nadu's growth in education, industry, health and infrastructure.\n\n\"On the other side, there are despicable people who believe that DMK can be overthrown by slander and false propaganda against the party, pioneers of Dravidian movement and Dravidian model govt,'' he said.\n\n\"But for us, the electoral field for 2026 assembly election is waiting.

This huge responsibility lies with the youth wing, he said. \"Let us defeat the conspiracies and vow to form govt again in 2026 on the 45th anniversary of the youth wing,'' Udhayanidhi said.\n\nThe DMK youth wing has done enormous work in the past and a lot more awaits, he said.

However, it's still under discussion,\" the senior leader said, adding that such an arrangement was being considered because of the law-and-order issue in the state.\n\n\"The chief minister's foreign visit is not new. But, since the law-and-order issue crops up every now and then, he wants to place somebody in his absence to take care of his portfolios,\" the senior leader added.\n\nAfter the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Udhayanidhi was made the secretary of DMK's youth wing. He contested the 2021 assembly polls from Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni constituency and won. He was made a cabinet minister in December 2022.\n\nThe present Tamil Nadu cabinet has 34 ministers, including the CM. After Senthil Balaji was dropped from the state's cabinet, a new minister has not been added to the cabinet.\n\nIn a series of meetings held at the DMK's headquarters, the senior leaders have decided to bring in Salem North Constituency MLA R. Rajendran into the cabinet. \"It was suggested that the backward classes welfare department be allotted to him. However, the CM is yet to take a final call on it,\" the senior leader, privy to the developments in the meetings, told ThePrint.\n\n\"Senior Minister K.N. Nehru is likely to be given the mines and minerals department, which is currently being held by Durai Murugan,\" the senior leader told ThePrint. The move comes days after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) wrote to the State DGP about illegal sand mining in the state.\n\nPortfolios of Ma. Subramanian, S. Muthusamy, R.S. Raja Kannappan, I. Periyasamy, R. Sakkarapani, and E.V. Velu are likely to be shuffled. All these ministers, along with MLA R. Rajendran, were present for the meeting held Wednesday.\n\nMultiple sources in the DMK ThePrint spoke to said that they had expected the cabinet reshuffle to take place soon after the Lok Sabha election results were announced. \"However, because of the hooch tragedy and Vikravandi by-polls, it got delayed,\" another senior leader in the party said.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prabhakar_tamilarasu@theprint.in", "name": "Prabhakar Tamilarasu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udhayanidhi_Stalin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Udhayanidhi Stalin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._K._Stalin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "M.

But still some feel that his promotion as the vice captain is a bit early.\n\nStalin Jr has no such sceptics. It is only a question of 'when'. But even within the dynastic Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), he being catapulted to the top has been remarkably speedy.\n\nAs a warm-up, he was made the party's youth wing secretary in 2019.\n\nPresented the party's ticket to contest his family's pocket borough, Chepauk, in 2021. And in just over a year, in 2022, he was accommodated in his dad's 1.5-year-old ministerial team. And now, the belief, as widely reported in the media, is that he is formally anointed as Stalin's deputy before the latter takes off to the US in August.\n\nStalin, as a contrast, was kept in waiting for over 15 years to join his father's cabinet. He was made a Minister in 2006 -- in his fourth term as a legislator.\n\nStalin's Health Condition As Seen On Videos\n\nEven though Udhayanidhi's coronation was never in doubt in the family-first DMK, why is there some seeming hurry for the same now? After all, Stalin still has two years (Tamil Nadu Assembly elections will be around April-May 2026) to complete his first full term as the Chief Minister.\n\nAgain, going by what is reported in the mainline media, the Chief Minister Stalin's health condition may be a reason behind this inevitability (Udhayanidhi's elevation) being likely pushed early.\n\nAdmittedly, seeing the limited clips of Stalin available in public domain in recent times, it is clear that the Chief Minister is not in the best of shapes.\n\nHis walk has become slow and laboured and speech also developed a worrying incoherent drawl in the last one year or so. His interactions (with others) also seem to suggest a disorientation.\n\nOf course, these are just tell-tale signs as seen on video snips. And they could be misleading, too. But from what we get to see, things aren't all that rosy.\n\nIn the event, an official word about the true status of Stalin's health would be of help. But that is unlikely. So, murky rumours and dark gossip get to have a field day.\n\nOn the other hand, it is equally pertinent to ask: how much information about a politico's health does the public have a right to know?\n\nMGR, Jaya, And The Shroud Of Secrecy Over Their Health\n\nWhen it comes to leaders' health, Tamil Nadu's track record in parting with legitimate info has always been dubious.\n\nIn the 1980s, when the then All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) chief minister M G Ramachandran's health deteriorated, the public was left guessing and, worse, a cabal of backroom boys of the party handled the state's official affairs.\n\nEven after he returned from the US after a successful operation, MGR's health did not sufficiently recover for him to handle the travails of the big job. But he was propped by his inner team and presented to the state as a working chief minister.\n\nMuch later in 2016, even more dubiously, Sasikala and company kept the world in dark over the then chief minister J Jayalalithaa's health for nearly six months as she battled for life in Chennai's Apollo Hospital that had been turned into a security fortress.\n\nNo one knows with any amount of certainty as to what transpired really. All manner of conspiracy theories have been flying around since then. It would go down in the state's history as a shady and sordid six months of secrecy.\n\nParallels With Biden\n\nBut since the US is also coincidentally grappling with speculation over President Joe Biden's health, the larger query of how much health information a politician should reveal to the public deserves discussion.\n\nHealth of an individual, admittedly, is a private matter. For a politician, elaborate disclosure on the issue can possibly be used as a political weapon by his opponents.\n\nBut when one is in the sphere of public service and elected office, one does have a moral obligation to be transparent. A leader needs to inform the public about how well he or she can actually execute the job they have been elected to.\n\nStruggling with mental and physical ailments is part of the human condition. We all go through with that in our daily routines and official jobs. But some ailments can be managed without affecting one's work, but some can't be.\n\nWhat is sure though is that a high-pressure and important job like the state Chief Minister's needs a person whose physical and mental faculties are at their best.\n\nThe book The Hidden Campaign - FDR's Health and the 1944 Election is illuminating on this subject. It is about Franklin D Roosevelt running for his fourth term as the US president (the only president to have so many stints) in 1944.\n\nHis failing health seemed to hamper his campaign. But a small circle of family members, politicians and advisers ensured that he was re-elected, but he passed away a year later, and it affected the country in many ways.\n\nIn the case of Biden now, there are multiple speculative theories on his health condition. It is a free-for-all for fear and gossip mongers there. Fortunately, things aren't that bad in Tamil Nadu.\n\nBut with some reports claiming that the Chief Minister will be shortly travelling to the US for some medical treatment, there has been some room for uneasiness.\n\nBefore that turns into one full-blown worrying controversy, it may be better for him to come out with a formal official statement. In this circumstance, that would be what the doctor ordered.", "source": {"uri": "swarajyamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swarajyamag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "k_balakumar@swarajyamag.com", "name": "K Balakumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udhayanidhi_Stalin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Udhayanidhi Stalin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Stalin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prithvi_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prithvi Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_wing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Youth wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._G._Ramachandran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

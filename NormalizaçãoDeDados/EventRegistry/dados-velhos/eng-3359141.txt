I was happy. When the manager does not want you, you have to go.\n\n\"I am open to being a year in Brazil without playing, even if Chelsea fine me for a year and don't pay me.\n\n\"I'll come back stronger. If I was in the wrong, I'd go back now and do as they say.\"\n\nIn Costa's absence, the Blues lost 3-2 to Burnley on Saturday's opening day of the Premier League season.\n\nCosta has two years remaining on the contract signed with Chelsea on his arrival from Atletico, but, after being granted an additional week of leave and missing the pre-season tour to Asia, Costa is still to return to London around two weeks after his expected arrival.\n\nThe striker, speaking at his family home in Lagarto, Brazil, said he has not reported for training as he does not want to train with the Blues' reserves, and is happy staying in Brazil and paying club fines until his future is resolved.\n\nHe added: \"They gave me a week extra off but since then it's fines all the way. They want me training with the reserves. I am not going to do that.\n\n\"I am not a criminal and I am not in the wrong here.

I was on the brink of renewing my contract and they put the brakes on it. I suspect the manager was behind it.\"\n\nCosta was critical of Conte, saying the former Juventus and Italy boss \"doesn't possess charisma\" and expressing anger over the Italian's communication.\n\nHe added: \"There are ways of going about it.

They want me training with the reserves. I am not going to do that.\n\n\"I am not a criminal and I am not in the wrong here. So, if they need to fine me, let them fine me.\"\n\nChelsea do not have a reserve team, only age-group sides, and Costa has been given no indication he would be expected to train with them, Press Association Sport understands.\n\nCosta joined Chelsea from Atletico in July 2014 and has twice won the Premier League title during his three years at Stamford Bridge.\n\nHe has scored 59 goals - 52 in the Premier League - across 120 appearances for the Blues.\n\nThe 28-year-old claims he was told he was not wanted by head coach Antonio Conte by text message in the summer and the frontman wishes to return to Atletico.\n\nThe Blues declined to respond to Costa's comments and Conte has recently been reluctant to discuss the player, describing the situation as belonging in \"the past\".\n\nChelsea have previously insisted the decision that Costa should leave this summer was made in January, with both the player and his agent, Jorge Mendes, aware.\n\n\"I am waiting for Chelsea to set me free,\" Costa said.\n\n\"I didn't want to leave. I was happy. When the manager does not want you, you have to go.\n\n\"I am open to being a year in Brazil without playing, even if Chelsea fine me for a year and don't pay me.\n\n\"I'll come back stronger. If I was in the wrong, I'd go back now and do as they say.\"\n\nIn Costa's absence, the Blues lost 3-2 to Burnley on Saturday, the full opening day of the Premier League season.\n\nCosta only wants to move to Atletico, who are under a transfer embargo and cannot register new players until January.\n\n\"My desire is to go to Atletico. I have rejected other offers,\" he added.\n\n\"If I'm off, I'm going to the club I want to go to, not the club that's paying the most.\"\n\nThe striker said he was happy at Stamford Bridge until Conte made it clear he had no future in the team.\n\nThe friction can be traced to January, when Costa missed the Premier League trip to Leicester after a rumoured behind-the-scenes row with Conte and his coaching staff following speculation over a mega-money move to China.\n\nConte publicly stated Costa's absence was due to a back injury, but the player has now admitted it was for disciplinary reasons.\n\n\"That was a punishment for the attitude I had shown and for not behaving in the best way,\" he added.\n\nCosta also says he was nearing a new contract with Chelsea at the time, but believes Conte put a halt to negotiations.\n\nCosta was critical of Conte, saying the former Juventus and Italy boss \"doesn't possess charisma\" and expressing anger over the Italian's communication.\n\nHe added: \"There are ways of going about it.

'The red card changed the game but anyway, you've come a long way and I have nothing to hide. Come on in.'\n\nDiego Costa invited Sportsmail into his family home for an exclusive interview on Saturday\n\nCosta was watching his Chelsea team being beaten at home in the Premier League by Burnley\n\nCosta spoke exclusively to Sportsmail's Adam Crafton about his future in football\n\nSo in we go, to be greeted with smiles and handshakes from Costa's parents, Jose de Jesus and Josileide, and a small entourage of family friends.\n\nHis father, known as Zeinha, is the man who named his son after Diego Maradona while Costa's elder brother is Jair, after Jairzinho, the Brazilian icon of the 1970 World Cup.\n\nPerching himself on a chair in the garden, Costa smiles ruefully: 'It's been a strange summer.' Strange is one word for it.\n\nAfter helping Chelsea to the Premier League title by scoring 20 goals in manager Antonio Conte's first season at the club, Costa finds himself 5,000 miles from Stamford Bridge on the opening weekend of the new campaign.\n\nCosta's summer began with a text message from Conte, informing him his Chelsea career was over. Costa has not been at Chelsea since the FA Cup final in May and, during a half-hour conversation, the striker delivers a blistering retort.\n\nHe accuses Chelsea of treating him 'like a criminal' and refuses to rule out legal action. He says he will always keep Conte's text message on his phone and claims the Chelsea manager 'lacks charisma'. Costa also accuses Conte of blocking his contract negotiations in January.\n\nCosta's summer began with a text from Antonio Conte, telling him his Chelsea career was over\n\nCosta says he has been fined several weeks' wages but is defying demands to return to train with the reserves. The Spain international insists he wants a transfer to Atletico Madrid resolved this month and that, meanwhile, he is ready to see out his Chelsea contract unpaid and train alone near his home in Brazil.\n\nJose Mourinho, Costa's former manager at Chelsea, once described Lagarto - the player's hometown - as so remote that it sits 'beyond the sunset'. Located 80 miles inland from the coastal city of Aracaju, the capital of the Brazilian state of Sergipe, it is a modest place of refuge.\n\nLagarto has just over 100,000 inhabitants and is known for its farms growing cassava and tobacco but Diego Costa is the biggest show in town.\n\nA life-size graffiti mural of Costa in Chelsea blue gleams on one streetside wall. Over the past month, images have emerged of Costa going for a Jet Ski ride with his dog, attending the circus and partying in an Atletico shirt.\n\nCosta's family home features plenty of trophies and awards from his playing career\n\nHis family have never moved house. 'Only renovated,' he grins. 'You don't forget where you came from.'\n\nThe mantelpiece bears mementos of life in England and Spain, including his trophy for making the PFA Team of the Year, man-of-the-match awards from games against Everton and Crystal Palace and the Zarra prize as the Spaniard who scored most goals in La Liga in 2014.\n\nAs the final moments of Chelsea's 3-2 defeat by Burnley play out, his father peeks round the door. Zeinha shakes his head. Costa says: 'They are two players down, to be fair, Dad.' Another friend pops by: 'Bring back Diego!' he laughs. Costa grimaces.\n\nAs Chelsea chase the game, Costa's intensity builds. David Luiz makes it 3-2 with two minutes left. Costa is off the settee and celebrating, dropping his phone.\n\n'The Premier League is the top. These moments, chasing a game, with seconds to spare. It's what we live for. You saw Arsenal against Leicester? Madness. Then Liverpool? 3-3, last minute! Rooney has scored for Everton!I wouldn't be human if I didn't miss those moments.'\n\n***\n\nThere are plenty of reminders of his time at Chelsea and in London, but Costa is now in Brazil\n\nThere are photos all over the Costa living room of Diego playing for Chelsea and in Spain\n\nFirst things first, Costa is not expecting an SOS plea from Conte to return. 'No,' he insists. 'You know that the manager doesn't want me.\n\n'I am waiting for Chelsea to set me free. I didn't want to leave. I was happy. When the manager does not want you, you have to go.\n\n'If you were to ask all my team-mates, they'd say the same. They send messages saying \"I miss you\" and that they love me.\n\n'I am always talking with the boys - particularly Cesc Fabregas, David Luiz and Willian. We have banter over WhatsApp.\n\n'They ask how I am. They really love me for the person I am. If they didn't, they wouldn't be saying they miss me and love me.'\n\nCosta is a hero in his home town, Lagarto, which sits 80 miles from the coast of Brazil\n\nHe is buying land to launch his own football school that will be called Balon de Oro\n\nLagarto has just over 100,000 inhabitants and is known for its cassava and tobacco farms\n\nSo Diego, where did it all go wrong? 'I cannot speak for other people, only for myself. I had a great season. I fought in every game until the last moment.'\n\nIt was not always a rose-tinted picture at Stamford Bridge. In January, Sportsmail revealed that Costa had been embroiled in a training-ground row with fitness coach Julio Tous.\n\nConte attributed Costa's absence from the next match at Leicester to a niggling back problem. 'No, no, no,' Costa insists. 'That was a punishment for the attitude I had shown and for not behaving in the best way.'\n\nThen rumours of a move to China surfaced. It was smoothed over but tensions simmered. Costa had been close to agreeing a new deal at the club.\n\n'In January, things happened with the coach. I was on the brink of renewing my contract and they put the brakes on it. I suspect the manager was behind it. He asked for that to happen.\n\n'His ideas are very fixed and clear. I have seen the sort of person he is. He has his own opinion and that will not change.\n\n'I respect him as a great coach. He has done a good job and I can see that, but as a person, no. He is not a coach who is very close with his players. He is very distant. He doesn't possess charisma.'\n\nCosta admits his former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho called this summer to say good luck\n\nMention of the word charisma brings us to Mourinho and Costa smiles warmly: 'Jose has called me, direct to my phone, just to check I am OK and to see how I am.\n\n'He wished me good luck. I never had any problems with Jose, we have a strong relationship. Everyone was very sad when things didn't work out in the end for him at Chelsea.'\n\nCosta takes out his mobile, responding to a friend. Here Costa is king, the boy made good but who never forgets his roots.\n\nHe is buying land to launch his own football school that will be called Balon de Oro, after the Ballon d'Or, and he is working closely with the local authorities to improve lives for young people.\n\nThe 28-year-old striker works every day in the gym with a personal trainer and has been spotted spending his evenings playing Buraco, a card game similar to rummy, with friends.\n\nCosta wants to return to Atletico Madrid, who he played for between 2010 and 2014\n\n'What is happening now with Chelsea is sad,' he says. 'The text message - I understand it when a coach wants a different player.\n\n'Alvaro Morata is a great player. He had a great season in Madrid and actually with the way this crazy transfer market is, I think they got a good price for a young and talented forward. He will triumph at Chelsea, but there are ways of going about it. You don't do it by text message. You should be honest and direct to someone's face.\n\n'I was with the Spain national team, alone in my room, when it came through. It was a shock to get it like that. I was showing it to my team-mates and they could not believe how he had done it.\n\n'I was angry at the time. Now I am more calm. I have not deleted the message. If people accuse me of lying, I can show them. It was clear, saying that he didn't count on me and wishing me the best for the future. Full stop.'\n\nCosta insists Conte did not raise the issue with him after the 2-1 FA Cup final defeat by Arsenal. 'No, no, no. There was no conversation or talks. Conte has his mentality. He thinks it's the best way of working.\n\n'He arrived from an Italian league where everyone is very serious and arrived in a dressing room where there are maybe more jokes.\n\n'The worst bit of all this, it is for the fans. They have always treated me so well, always, always. For this, I am sad. I hope they understand things happen in football. Conte is a great coach. He deserves to be where he is but it's his opinion. He has his reasons.'\n\n****\n\nCosta says he is still in close contact with his team mates at Chelsea, including David Luiz\n\nCosta says he gets WhatsApp messages from likes of Cesc Fabregas saying they miss him\n\nCosta has helped fire Chelsea to two Premier League titles in three years in England\n\nCosta may offer his gratitude to supporters but matters have threatened to turn nasty. His lawyer, Ricardo Cardoso, has warned that Costa will use 'all legal mechanisms' to force a transfer and alleged Conte's conduct amounted to 'discriminatory behaviour'.\n\nCosta says legal proceedings are yet to begin, explaining: 'At the moment, no. I want people to do things the right way.\n\n'Why won't they let me go if they don't want me? I have to do what I have to do. I have to think of myself. I've been a good boy here and tried to do the right thing.\n\n'My desire is to go to Atletico (where he played from 2010-14). I've spoken to Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia. I said, \"If the manager doesn't want me, I want to go to Atletico Madrid\".\n\n'I have rejected other offers. They want to sell me to China or other teams. The language is better for me in Spain. If I'm off, I'm going to the club I want to go to -- not the club that's paying the most.\n\n'Diego Simeone (Atletico manager) wants me. It is very clear. I have always had a bond with him. The fans and people love me there. They respect me.'\n\nCosta accuses Conte of lacking charisma, and of being cold and distant with his players\n\nChelsea, he alleges, have reduced him to the status of a 'criminal' - 'They want me to be there training with the reserves. I wouldn't be allowed access to the first-team dressing room and I would have no contact at all with the guys. I'm not a criminal! I don't think it is fair after all I have done to be treated like that.'\n\nChelsea have asked Costa back for training and their stance remains that he is still their player and they expect him to return.\n\nCosta's defiance has already cost him. 'They gave me a week extra off but since then it's fines all the way. They want me training with the reserves. I am not going to do that. I am not a criminal and I am not in the wrong here. So, if they need to fine me, let them fine me.\n\n'I take the hit every week but I'm not driven by money. The important thing is to be happy with how I live. I'm here with my parents and people who respect me.'\n\nWould Costa ever return or would he consider a move to another English club? 'If I have to I will stay in Brazil,' he says.\n\nCosta says he will never delete Conte's text and feels he has been treated like a 'criminal'\n\n'I am open to being a year in Brazil without playing, even if Chelsea fine me for a year and don't pay me. I'll come back stronger. If I was in the wrong, I'd go back now and do as they say.\n\n'At the start of summer, they gave me an extra week of holiday. Then a week later they called to see where I was but by then the team was in Asia on tour, so I could go back and not have any contact with the boys.\n\n'That seems a very bad and ugly life. It doesn't respect what I have done for the club. I am here with people who love me. I want the fans to know I still care deeply about them but I'm not going back to be separated like that.\n\n'I want the deal with Atletico resolved this month. My idea would be to go to Madrid, train there, get in the best physical shape and be ready to fire ahead of the World Cup.'", "id": "8972762", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-13", "title": "DIEGO

The 28-year-old is happy staying in Brazil and paying club fines until his future is resolved.\n\nStandard Sport understands that Chelsea want Costa to honour the terms of his contract and return to training in order to get himself match fit and available for selection for Antonio Conte's Premier League champions.\n\nWhile Chelsea are willing to let the Spain international go if the club agrees a transfer fee with Atletico, the Blues expect Costa to act in a professional manner as he seeks a Stamford Bridge exit. Chelsea want \u00a350m for the forward, but Atletico have only offered \u00a326m so far.\n\nThe move is also further complicated by the fact that Atletico cannot register new players until January due to a Fifa transfer ban.\n\nCosta's potential return to Chelsea does not represent a U-turn by Conte regarding the striker's future. It has been reported Chelsea have fined him two weeks' wages, but the club are refusing to confirm the size of fine.\n\nHe is paid \u00a3150,000-a-week and has been AWOL for four weeks so far.\n\nCosta told the Daily Mail: \"I am waiting for Chelsea to set me free.

The Blues declined to respond to Costa's comments and Conte has recently been reluctant to discuss Costa, describing the situation as \"the past\".\n\nChelsea have previously insisted the decision for Costa to leave this summer was made in January, with both the player and his agent, Jorge Mendes, aware. \"I am waiting for Chelsea to set me free,\" the player said. \"I didn't want to leave. I was happy. When the manager does not want you, you have to go.\n\n\"I am open to being a year in Brazil without playing, even if Chelsea fine me for a year and don't pay me.

They want me training with the reserves. I am not going to do that.\n\n\"I am not a criminal and I am not in the wrong here.

I was on the brink of renewing my contract and they put the brakes on it. I suspect the manager was behind it. He asked for that to happen.\"\n\nAlthough Conte seems to be adored universally, Costa says that's far from the case with Chelsea's squad\n\n\"His ideas are very fixed and clear. I have seen the sort of person he is. He has his own opinion and that will not change. I respect him as a great coach. He has done a good job and I can see that, but as a person, no. He is not a coach who is very close with his players. He is very distant. He doesn't possess charisma.\"\n\nCosta is holding out for a move to Atletico Madrid, who are banned from signing new players until January 2018, but Chelsea want to sell him to the Chinese Super League. His lawyer is also talking about taking action against Conte's \"discriminatory behavior\"\n\n\"Why won't they let me go if they don't want me? I have to do what I have to do. I have to think of myself. I've been a good boy here and tried to do the right thing. My desire is to go to Atletico [Madrid]. I've spoken to Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia. I said, 'If the manager doesn't want me, I want to go to Atletico Madrid.' I have rejected other offers.\n\n\"They want to sell me to China or other teams. The language is better for me in Spain. If I'm off, I'm going to the club I want to go to -- not the club that's paying the most. Diego Simeone wants me. It is very clear. I have always had a bond with him. The fans and people love me there. They respect me.\"\n\nAs far as Costa is concerned he has no future at Chelsea, plus he also claims his teammates send him messages of support\n\n\"I am waiting for Chelsea to set me free. I didn't want to leave. I was happy. When the manager does not want you, you have to go. If you were to ask all my team-mates, they'd say the same. They send messages saying 'I miss you' and that they love me. I am always talking with the boys -- particularly Cesc Fabregas, David Luiz and Willian. We have banter over WhatsApp. They ask how I am. They really love me for the person I am. If they didn't, they wouldn't be saying they miss me and love me.\"\n\nIf a move to Atletico doesn't materialize, Costa is fine with staying in Brazil for a year\n\n\"If I have to I will stay in Brazil. I am open to being a year in Brazil without playing, even if Chelsea fine me for a year and don't pay me. I'll come back stronger. If I was in the wrong, I'd go back now and do as they say. At the start of summer, they gave me an extra week of holiday. Then a week later they called to see where I was but by then the team was in Asia on tour, so I could go back and not have any contact with the boys.\n\n\"That seems a very bad and ugly life. It doesn't respect what I have done for the club. I am here with people who love me. I want the fans to know I still care deeply about them but I'm not going back to be separated like that. I want the deal with Atletico resolved this month. My idea would be to go to Madrid, train there, get in the best physical shape and be ready to fire ahead of the World Cup.\"\n\nCosta will continue to be fined by Chelsea for staying in Brazil and training there on his own instead of with Chelsea's reserves, but that's what he intends to do unless the situation changes\n\n\"They want me to be there training with the reserves. I wouldn't be allowed access to the first-team dressing room and I would have no contact at all with the guys. I'm not a criminal.

The red card changed the game but anyway, you've come a long way and I have nothing to hide. Come on in.\"\n\nSo in we go, to be greeted with smiles and handshakes from Costa's parents, Jose de Jesus and Josileide, and a small entourage of family friends.\n\nHis father, known as Zeinha, is the man who named his son after Diego Maradona while Costa's elder brother is Jair, after Jairzinho, the Brazilian icon of the 1970 World Cup. Perching himself on a chair in the garden, Costa smiles ruefully: \"It's been a strange summer.\" Strange is one word for it.\n\nAfter helping Chelsea to the English Premier League title by scoring 20 goals in manager Antonio Conte's first season at the club, Costa finds himself 5 000 miles from Stamford Bridge on the opening weekend of the new campaign.\n\nCosta's summer began with a text message from Conte, informing him his Chelsea career was over.\n\nCosta has not been at Chelsea since the FA Cup final in May and, during a half-hour conversation, the striker delivers a blistering retort.\n\nHe accuses Chelsea of treating him \"like a criminal\" and refuses to rule out legal action.\n\nHe says he will always keep Conte's text message on his phone and claims the Chelsea manager \"lacks charisma\". Costa also accuses Conte of blocking his contract negotiations in January.\n\nCosta says he has been fined several weeks' wages but is defying demands to return to train with the reserves. The Spain international insists he wants a transfer to Atletico Madrid resolved this month and that, meanwhile, he is ready to see out his Chelsea contract unpaid and train alone near his home in Brazil.\n\nJose Mourinho, Costa's former manager at Chelsea, once described Lagarto - the player's hometown - as so remote that it sits \"beyond the sunset\".\n\nLocated 80 miles inland from the coastal city of Aracaju, the capital of the Brazilian state of Sergipe, it is a modest place of refuge. Lagarto has just over 100 000 inhabitants and is known for its farms growing cassava (a root vegetable) and tobacco but Diego Costa is the biggest show in town.\n\nA life-size graffiti mural of Costa in Chelsea blue gleams on one streetside wall. Over the past month, images have emerged of Costa going for a Jet Ski ride with his dog, attending the circus and partying in an Atletico shirt.\n\nHis family have never moved house. \"Only renovated,\" he grins. \"You don't forget where you came from.\"\n\nThe mantelpiece bears mementoes of life in England and Spain, including his trophy for making the PFA Team of the Year, man-of-the-match awards from games against Everton and Crystal Palace and the Zarra prize as the Spaniard who scored most goals in the Spanish La Liga in 2014.\n\nAs the final moments of Chelsea's 3-2 defeat by Burnley play out, his father peeks round the door. Zeinha shakes his head. Costa says: \"They are two players down, to be fair, Dad.\" Another friend pops by: \"Bring back Diego!\" he laughs. Costa grimaces.\n\nAs Chelsea chase the game, Costa's intensity builds. David Luiz makes it 3-2 with two minutes left. Costa is off the settee and celebrating, dropping his phone.\n\n\"The Premier League is the top. These moments, chasing a game, with seconds to spare. It's what we live for. You saw Arsenal against Leicester? Madness. Then Liverpool? 3-3, last minute! Rooney has scored for Everton! I wouldn't be human if I didn't miss those moments.\"\n\nFirst things first, Costa is not expecting an SOS plea from Conte to return. \"No,\" he insists. \"You know that the manager doesn't want me.\n\n\"I am waiting for Chelsea to set me free. I didn't want to leave. I was happy. When the manager does not want you, you have to go.\n\n\"If you were to ask all my team-mates, they'd say the same. They send messages saying 'I miss you' and that they love me.\n\n\"I am always talking with the boys - particularly Cesc Fabregas, David Luiz and Willian. We have banter over WhatsApp. They ask how I am. They really love me for the person I am. If they didn't, they wouldn't be saying they miss me and love me.\"\n\nSo Diego, where did it all go wrong?\n\n\"I cannot speak for other people, only for myself. I had a great season. I fought in every game until the last moment.\"\n\nIt was not always a rose-tinted picture at Stamford Bridge. In January, Sportsmail revealed that Costa had been embroiled in a training-ground row with fitness coach Julio Tous. Conte attributed Costa's absence from the next match at Leicester to a niggling back problem. \"No, no, no,\" Costa insists. \"That was a punishment for the attitude I had shown and for not behaving in the best way.\" Then rumours of a move to China surfaced. It was smoothed over but tensions simmered. Costa had been close to agreeing a new deal at the club.\n\n\"In January, things happened with the coach. I was on the brink of renewing my contract and they put the brakes on it. I suspect the manager was behind it. He asked for that to happen.\n\n\"His ideas are very fixed and clear. I have seen the sort of person he is. He has his own opinion and that will not change.\n\n\"I respect him as a great coach. He has done a good job and I can see that, but as a person, no. He is not a coach who is very close with his players. He is very distant. He doesn't possess charisma.\"\n\nMention of the word charisma brings us to Mourinho and Costa smiles warmly: \"Jose has called me, direct to my phone, just to check I am OK and to see how I am.\n\n\"He wished me good luck. I never had any problems with Jose, we have a strong relationship. Everyone was very sad when things didn't work out in the end for him at Chelsea.\"\n\nCosta takes out his mobile, responding to a friend. Here Costa is king, the boy made good but who never forgets his roots. He is buying land to launch his own football school that will be called Balon de Oro, after the Ballon d'Or, and he is working closely with the local authorities to improve lives for young people.\n\nThe 28-year-old striker works every day in the gym with a personal trainer and has been spotted spending his evenings playing Buraco, a card game similar to rummy, with friends.\n\n\"What is happening now with Chelsea is sad,\" he says.\n\n\"The text message - I understand it when a coach wants a different player.\n\n\"Alvaro Morata is a great player. He had a great season in Madrid and actually with the way this crazy transfer market is, I think they got a good price for a young and talented forward. He will triumph at Chelsea, but there are ways of going about it. You don't do it by text message. You should be honest and direct to someone's face.\n\n\"I was with the Spain national team, alone in my room, when it came through. It was a shock to get it like that. I was showing it to my team-mates and they could not believe how he had done it.\n\n\"I was angry at the time. Now I am more calm. I have not deleted the message. If people accuse me of lying, I can show them. It was clear, saying that he didn't count on me and wishing me the best for the future. Full stop.\"\n\nCosta insists Conte did not raise the issue with him after the 2-1 FA Cup final defeat by Arsenal. \"No, no, no. There was no conversation or talks. Conte has his mentality. He thinks it's the best way of working.\n\n\"He arrived from an Italian league where everyone is very serious and arrived in a dressing room where there are maybe more jokes.\n\n\"The worst bit of all this, it is for the fans. They have always treated me so well - always, always. For this, I am sad. I hope they understand things happen in football.\n\n\"Conte is a great coach. He deserves to be where he is but it's his opinion. He has his reasons.\" Costa may offer his gratitude to Chelsea supporters but matters have threatened to turn nasty.\n\nHis lawyer, Ricardo Cardoso, has warned that Costa will use \"all legal mechanisms\" to force a transfer and alleged Conte's conduct amounted to 'discriminatory behaviour'.\n\nCosta says legal proceedings are yet to begin, explaining: \"At the moment, no. I want people to do things the right way.\n\n\"Why won't they let me go if they don't want me? I have to do what I have to do. I have to think of myself. I've been a good boy here and tried to do the right thing.\n\n\"My desire is to go to Atletico (where he played from 2010-14). I've spoken to Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia. I said, 'If the manager doesn't want me, I want to go to Atletico Madrid'.\n\n\"I have rejected other offers. They want to sell me to China or other teams. The language is better for me in Spain. If I'm off, I'm going to the club I want to go to - not the club that's paying the most.\n\n\"Diego Simeone (Atletico manager) wants me. It is very clear. I have always had a bond with him. The fans and people love me there. They respect me.\"\n\nChelsea, he alleges, have reduced him to the status of a \"criminal\".\n\n\"They want me to be there training with the reserves. I wouldn't be allowed access to the first-team dressing room and I would have no contact at all with the guys.\n\n\"I'm not a criminal! I don't think it is fair after all I have done to be treated like that.\"\n\nCosta's defiance has already cost him. \"They gave me a week extra off but since then it's fines all the way. They want me training with the reserves. I am not going to do that. I am not a criminal and I am not in the wrong here. So, if they need to fine me, let them fine me.\n\n\"I take the hit every week but I'm not driven by money. The important thing is to be happy with how I live. I'm here with my parents and people who respect me.\"\n\nWould Costa ever return or would he consider a move to another English club? \"If I have to I will stay in Brazil,\" he says.\n\n\"I am open to being a year in Brazil without playing, even if Chelsea fine me for a year and don't pay me. I'll come back stronger. If I was in the wrong, I'd go back now and do as they say.\n\n\"At the start of summer, they gave me an extra week of holiday. Then a week later they called to see where I was but by then the team was in Asia on tour, so I could go back and not have any contact with the boys. 'That seems a very bad and ugly life. It doesn't respect what I have done for the club. I am here with people who love me. I want the fans to know I still care deeply about them but I'm not going back to be separated like that.\n\n\"I want the deal with Atletico resolved this month. My idea would be to go to Madrid, train there, get in the best physical shape and be ready to fire ahead of the World Cup.\" - Mailonline.", "id": "9174789", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14",

I was on the brink of renewing my contract and they put the brakes on it. I suspect the manager was behind it. He asked for that to happen.\"\n\nAlthough Conte seems to be adored universally, Costa says that's far from the case with Chelsea's squad\n\n\"His ideas are very fixed and clear. I have seen the sort of person he is. He has his own opinion and that will not change. I respect him as a great coach. He has done a good job and I can see that, but as a person, no. He is not a coach who is very close with his players. He is very distant. He doesn't possess charisma.\"\n\nCosta is holding out for a move to Atletico Madrid, who are banned from signing new players until January 2018, but Chelsea want to sell him to the Chinese Super League. His lawyer is also talking about taking action against Conte's \"discriminatory behavior\"\n\n\"Why won't they let me go if they don't want me? I have to do what I have to do. I have to think of myself. I've been a good boy here and tried to do the right thing. My desire is to go to Atletico [Madrid]. I've spoken to Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia. I said, 'If the manager doesn't want me, I want to go to Atletico Madrid.' I have rejected other offers.\n\n\"They want to sell me to China or other teams. The language is better for me in Spain. If I'm off, I'm going to the club I want to go to -- not the club that's paying the most. Diego Simeone wants me. It is very clear. I have always had a bond with him. The fans and people love me there. They respect me.\"\n\nAs far as Costa is concerned he has no future at Chelsea, plus he also claims his teammates send him messages of support\n\n\"I am waiting for Chelsea to set me free. I didn't want to leave. I was happy. When the manager does not want you, you have to go. If you were to ask all my team-mates, they'd say the same. They send messages saying 'I miss you' and that they love me. I am always talking with the boys -- particularly Cesc Fabregas, David Luiz and Willian. We have banter over WhatsApp. They ask how I am. They really love me for the person I am. If they didn't, they wouldn't be saying they miss me and love me.\"\n\nIf a move to Atletico doesn't materialize, Costa is fine with staying in Brazil for a year\n\n\"If I have to I will stay in Brazil. I am open to being a year in Brazil without playing, even if Chelsea fine me for a year and don't pay me. I'll come back stronger. If I was in the wrong, I'd go back now and do as they say. At the start of summer, they gave me an extra week of holiday. Then a week later they called to see where I was but by then the team was in Asia on tour, so I could go back and not have any contact with the boys.\n\n\"That seems a very bad and ugly life. It doesn't respect what I have done for the club. I am here with people who love me. I want the fans to know I still care deeply about them but I'm not going back to be separated like that. I want the deal with Atletico resolved this month. My idea would be to go to Madrid, train there, get in the best physical shape and be ready to fire ahead of the World Cup.\"\n\nCosta will continue to be fined by Chelsea for staying in Brazil and training there on his own instead of with Chelsea's reserves, but that's what he intends to do unless the situation changes\n\n\"They want me to be there training with the reserves. I wouldn't be allowed access to the first-team dressing room and I would have no contact at all with the guys. I'm not a criminal. I don't think it is fair after all I have done to be treated like that. They gave me a week extra off but since then it's fines all the way. They want me training with the reserves. I am not going to do that. I am not a criminal and I am not in the wrong here. So, if they need to fine me, let them fine me. I take the hit every week but I'm not driven by money.

Here Press Association Sport asks some of the most pressing questions about the situation.\n\nWhen did this all start?\n\nWhat a win!!! Great team work and great atmosphere from our fans! Thank you all! #CapitalOneCupFinal pic.twitter.com/8lSh2oFm2j -- Diego Costa (@diegocosta)\n\nMarch 1, 2015\n\nCosta signed for Chelsea from Atletico Madrid for \u00a332million on a five-year contract in July 2014, but there have been continual reports of a move back to the Spanish capital ever since. Hamstring problems plagued his first season but the striker still scored 20 goals in Chelsea's 2014-15 title-winning campaign. There were also on-field disciplinary issues accompanied by retrospective suspensions which led Costa to consider leaving England. Some Chelsea supporters also blamed him for Jose Mourinho's departure in December 2015. He reestablished their faith and scored 20 goals in a second Premier League title success last season.\n\nWhat about his relationship with Antonio Conte?\n\nJose Mourinho signed Costa (Adam Davy/PA)\n\nCosta was integral to Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, leading the forward line with a snarl as arch-antagonist and chief goalscorer. His importance was similar to Conte's Chelsea side last season, with some suggesting the Blues would not have won the title if they had let Costa leave in January. That was when the major fissures occurred as Costa was left out of the team for the win at Leicester following reports of a behind-the-scenes row over a mega-money move to China. Publicly Conte insisted it was because of a back injury.\n\nIf he was so important, why is he surplus to requirements at Chelsea?\n\nCosta kissed the Premier League trophy (Nick Potts/Empics)\n\nConte may have decided Costa was not worth the trouble. The celebrations after the title-clinching win at West Brom in May included Costa, perhaps jokingly, brandishing a fire extinguisher while Conte spoke to a group of journalists. It was a tiny snippet of what it might be like to manage Costa on a daily basis. Plus, if he has agitated for a move, the striker's loyalty may be in question. Costa is also 29 in October, so Conte may want a younger man to lead his team. He has now got Alvaro Morata.\n\nDid Conte make the decision to get rid of Costa?\n\nDiego Costa and Antonio Conte\n\nYes - and this is where there is some dispute. Chelsea and Conte say Costa and his agent, Jorge Mendes, knew in January that the striker would be leaving this summer. Costa claims he was informed by text message in June and has engaged his lawyers. He was expected to return to London in the last two weeks, but remains in exile in Brazil saying Chelsea are fining him for not returning to the club. He is under contract for two more years, but the fact the row has become public - and Costa's determination to rejoin Atletico, rather than go elsewhere - significantly reduces his value.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nToda honra e toda gl\u00f3ria seja dada a Deus! Parab\u00e9ns rapaziada!!!!! Come on Chelsea!!!\u1f4aa\u1f3fd\u1f499 pic.twitter.com/uLtvPjrLAs -- Diego Costa (@diegocosta)\n\nMay 12, 2017\n\nThere are a number of possible scenarios. Chelsea could agree a deal for Costa to join Atletico, who cannot register new players until January due to a transfer embargo, so they may loan him out elsewhere. With no deal with Atletico agreed, Costa could also remain in Brazil, effectively on strike while the lawyers continue to negotiate. Alternatively, Costa may return to London, training with the Chelsea reserves or on his own, winding down his contract and waiting for a transfer to Atletico. The most unlikely scenario would see a reconciliation with Conte and Chelsea, which would allow for Costa's return.", "id": "9073862", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Q&A: Why has Diego Costa\u00b4s relationship with Chelsea turned so sour?", "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2017/08/14/12/wire-1133979-1502711409-704_636x382.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 342, "date": "2015-03-01", "amb": false, "textEnd": 355}, {"textStart": 3096, "date": "2017-05-12", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3108}, {"textStart": 446, "date": "2014-07-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 455}, {"textStart": 876, "date": "2015-12-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 889}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-14", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "30", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}, "id": "304433", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}, "id": "304434", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "West Bromwich Albion F.C."}, "id": "307096", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Antonio Conte"}, "id": "311374", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Conte"}, {"label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}, "id": "312748", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer (association football)"}, "id": "313860", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(association_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Diego Costa"}, "id": "313877", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Costa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jorge Mendes"}, "id": "349920", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Mendes"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dada"}, "id": "352964", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada"}, {"label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}, "id": "357896", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata"}, {"label": {"eng": "Retrospective"}, "id": "381300", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"}, {"label": {"eng": "Back injury"}, "id": "402120", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_injury"}], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "12:18:00"}

Here Press Association Sport asks some of the most pressing questions about the situation.\n\nWhen did this all start?\n\nCosta signed for Chelsea from Atletico Madrid for \u00a332million on a five-year contract in July 2014, but there have been continual reports of a move back to the Spanish capital ever since. Hamstring problems plagued his first season but the striker still scored 20 goals in Chelsea's 2014-15 title-winning campaign. There were also on-field disciplinary issues accompanied by retrospective suspensions which led Costa to consider leaving England. Some Chelsea supporters also blamed him for Jose Mourinho's departure in December 2015. He reestablished their faith and scored 20 goals in a second Premier League title success last season.\n\nWhat about his relationship with Antonio Conte?\n\nCosta was integral to Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, leading the forward line with a snarl as arch-antagonist and chief goalscorer. His importance was similar to Conte's Chelsea side last season, with some suggesting the Blues would not have won the title if they had let Costa leave in January. That was when the major fissures occurred as Costa was left out of the team for the win at Leicester following reports of a behind-the-scenes row over a mega-money move to China. Publicly Conte insisted it was because of a back injury.\n\nIf he was so important, why is he surplus to requirements at Chelsea?\n\nConte may have decided Costa was not worth the trouble. The celebrations after the title-clinching win at West Brom in May included Costa, perhaps jokingly, brandishing a fire extinguisher while Conte spoke to a group of journalists. It was a tiny snippet of what it might be like to manage Costa on a daily basis. Plus, if he has agitated for a move, the striker's loyalty may be in question. Costa is also 29 in October, so Conte may want a younger man to lead his team. He has now got Alvaro Morata.\n\nDid Conte make the decision to get rid of Costa?\n\nYes - and this is where there is some dispute. Chelsea and Conte say Costa and his agent, Jorge Mendes, knew in January that the striker would be leaving this summer. Costa claims he was informed by text message in June and has engaged his lawyers. He was expected to return to London in the last two weeks, but remains in exile in Brazil saying Chelsea are fining him for not returning to the club. He is under contract for two more years, but the fact the row has become public - and Costa's determination to rejoin Atletico, rather than go elsewhere - significantly reduces his value.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThere are a number of possible scenarios. Chelsea could agree a deal for Costa to join Atletico, who cannot register new players until January due to a transfer embargo, so they may loan him out elsewhere. With no deal with Atletico agreed, Costa could also remain in Brazil, effectively on strike while the lawyers continue to negotiate. Alternatively, Costa may return to London, training with the Chelsea reserves or on his own, winding down his contract and waiting for a transfer to Atletico. The most unlikely scenario would see a reconciliation with Conte and Chelsea, which would allow for Costa's return.", "id": "9063453", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Why has Diego Costa's relationship with Chelsea turned so sour?", "image": "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/article36029911.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/PANews%20BT_P-ade775f8-f578-42b4-a9cb-9c172607a991_I1.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 436, "date": "2014-07-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 445}, {"textStart": 866, "date": "2015-12-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 879}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-14", "concepts": [], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "11:19:00"}

This bitter feud was well past the point of no return a long time ago, but that revelation of lawyers getting involved kicked it up a notch.\n\nWell, get ready because it's about to ramp up even further as Costa went completely scorched Earth on Conte in an extremely revealing interview for the Daily Mail.\n\nCosta is back in his hometown of Brazil, still trying to secure his move back to Atletico Madrid. Chelsea opened the season in a total disaster, falling behind 3-0 by halftime at home to lowly Burnley, and eventually losing 3-2 as they played the final minutes with just nine men.\n\nThe Mail tracked down Diego Costa and here some of the more interesting quotes and meaningful takeaways from their revealing and scathing interview.\n\n\"If I have to I will stay in Brazil. I am open to being a year in Brazil without playing, even if Chelsea fine me for a year and don't pay me. I'll come back stronger. If I was in the wrong, I'd go back now and do as they say. At the start of summer, they gave me an extra week of holiday. Then a week later they called to see where I was but by then the team was in Asia on tour, so I could go back and not have any contact with the boys.\n\n\"That seems a very bad and ugly life. It doesn't respect what I have done for the club. I am here with people who love me. I want the fans to know I still care deeply about them but I'm not going back to be separated like that. I want the deal with Atletico resolved this month. My idea would be to go to Madrid, train there, get in the best physical shape and be ready to fire ahead of the World Cup.\"\n\n2. Costa has his heart and mind set on Atletico, but Chelsea want to sell him to the Chinese Super League.\n\n\"Why won't they let me go if they don't want me? I have to do what I have to do. I have to think of myself. I've been a good boy here and tried to do the right thing. My desire is to go to Atletico [Madrid]. I've spoken to Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia. I said, 'If the manager doesn't want me, I want to go to Atletico Madrid.' I have rejected other offers.\n\n\"They want to sell me to China or other teams. The language is better for me in Spain. If I'm off, I'm going to the club I want to go to -- not the club that's paying the most. Diego Simeone wants me. It is very clear. I have always had a bond with him. The fans and people love me there. They respect me.\"\n\n3. Costa said a contract extension was in the works at Chelsea, but Conte squashed that. He also said that Conte isn't as well liked as outsiders might think he is.\n\n\"In January, things happened with the coach. I was on the brink of renewing my contract and they put the brakes on it. I suspect the manager was behind it. He asked for that to happen.\"\n\n\"His ideas are very fixed and clear. I have seen the sort of person he is. He has his own opinion and that will not change. I respect him as a great coach. He has done a good job and I can see that, but as a person, no. He is not a coach who is very close with his players. He is very distant.

The Spain international scored 20 goals last season to fire the Blues to the title but a falling out with the Italian has led to him becoming surplus to requirements in west London.\n\nThe 28-year-old has declared his intent to return to Atletico for a third spell with the club and has urged the Premier League champions to \"set him free\" after Conte informed Costa by text message that he was no longer wanted. Costa has longed for a return to Atletico where he has scored 64 goals in 134 appearances across two spells, guiding the club to the La Liga title and the Champions League final in his last season in 2014.\n\nAtletico, who cannot register Costa until January 2018 due to a transfer embargo imposed by Fifa, have already put together a detailed fitness plan to bring the striker up to speed after he was not involved in Chelsea's pre-season plans, such is their confidence that a deal will be agreed. The club are willing to pay in excess of \u00a340m to bring him back to his homeland, according to The Independent, and Terry Gibson feels the move is \"inevitable\".\n\n\"I can't believe there is not a deal to be done now, they have a transfer ban until January, but it suits Atletico Madrid and Chelsea and it suits Diego Costa,\" the former Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United striker told Sky Sports.\n\n\"But it is not great for Conte to have Costa knocking around in Brazil doing pretty much what he likes, and Chelsea still paying his wages I presume, unless they are fining him on a daily basis for not turning up to training.\n\n\"And of course, with the way Chelsea started on the weekend, and if results continue to go against them, the pressure will be on the manager that he made the wrong decision.\"\n\nGibson, who has previously worked as a scout in Spain for the likes of Manchester City, believes the manner in which Conte allegedly informed Costa that he was no longer wanted has seen his value plummet -

revealed that he has been fined by Chelsea for failing to return to training after being given an extra week off at the start of pre-season, following Antonio Conte's text message confirming he had no future at Stamford Bridge.\n\nIn an unsanctioned interview, Costa claimed he was prepared to spend an entire year in Brazil without being paid by Chelsea unless the club let him return to Atletico.\n\nBut Chelsea have reiterated to the 28-year-old that they expect him to return to England and fulfil the terms of his contract by training and doing everything he can to make himself fit and available for selection.\n\nNegotiations have taken place between Chelsea and Atletico over Costa's desired return to Spain, but the Premier League champions insist his contract must be adhered to until any such time as a transfer is agreed.\n\nChelsea reject claims that Costa was told he would have to train with the reserves if he returns to the club, although it remains highly improbable that he would play for head coach Conte again.\n\nConte this summer revealed that he first told Costa in January that he could leave at the end of last season, following a training ground row over interest from China.\n\nThat was followed by a text message sent in June, which reiterated that Costa was not part of Conte's plans for this season.\n\nCosta's lawyer Ricardo Cardoso has threatened legal action over Chelsea's handling of the player and threatened to use \"all possible legal mechanisms\" to force his return to Atletico.\n\nAtletico have seen a bid in the region of \u00a326million for Costa rejected by Chelsea, who are determined not to allow last season's top scorer to leave for a bargain price.\n\nThe Blues believe that with two years remaining on his contract, Costa is worth around \u00a340m, but it is not just the size of the transfer fee that has been a sticking point between Chelsea and Atletico.\n\nUnder their transfer embargo, Atletico cannot register new players until January and the Spanish club would prefer not to pay Costa's full \u00a3150,000-a-week wages while he cannot play.\n\nBut Chelsea are not interested in a deal that would see them subsidise any part of Costa's salary until the New Year and want him off the wage bill if he leaves.\n\nConte has started the season short of first-team players, with Michy Batshuayi having to start the defeat to Burnley as Chelsea's lone striker while summer signing Alvaro Morata works towards full fitness.\n\nMorata came off the bench to score against Burnley, but that has not altered Chelsea's stance that

The 28-year-old striker has since decided he would rather return to Atletico Madrid, but the clubs are not close to an agreement.\n\nTalks have stalled and Costa's lawyers want him released on a free transfer because his contract has been breached by Conte's message. For Chelsea, who value the Spain international at more than \u00a360million, losing him for nothing in a legal wrangle is a staggering prospect.\n\nCosta was given permission to report a week late for pre-season training as the club negotiated with Atletico. He was then omitted from a tour of China and Singapore, but hopes of a swift resolution soon disappeared.\n\nCosta is in his home town of Lagarto in Brazil and, in an exclusive Sportsmail interview, published on Sunday, he claimed Chelsea were treating him like a criminal. He vowed to continue training alone in South America rather than report back to work with the reserves in Surrey with no prospect of playing. 'That seems a very bad and ugly life,' said Costa. 'It doesn't respect what I have done for the club.'\n\nCosta has been training alone in Brazil and claimed Chelsea are treating him like a criminal\n\nHe vowed to stay in South America rather work with the reserves with no prospect of playing\n\nChelsea, however, are not prepared to let Costa languish on the other side of the Atlantic when he has two years left on a \u00a3180,000-a-week contract and they are short of players.\n\nThe case of Carlos Tevez and an Italian manager at Manchester City has been mentioned at Stamford Bridge. Tevez was exiled by Roberto Mancini after refusing to come on as a substitute in a Champions League match against Bayern Munich in September 2011.\n\nMancini, furious with the lack of respect shown to his leadership, was adamant that the Argentine had to go, but after a cooling-off period there was an apology and a return to City.\n\nTevez was soon back in the team and the pair survived another season together before both departing in 2013. The idea of having Costa back in Chelsea blue will have huge appeal to fans and some players at Stamford Bridge as he is a popular figure in the dressing room.\n\nCarlos Tevez's exile and return under Roberto Mancini has been mentioned at Stamford Bridge\n\nCosta has been linked with a return to Atletico Madrid to play under manager Diego Simeone\n\nAttempts to coax him back, however, are laced with belated good sense and legal posturing. Chelsea will be keen to make clear Costa has not been denied the chance to do his job as a footballer and there is always a route back into the team. They will also be trying to stir Atletico.\n\nThe transfer window closes two weeks on Thursday but the Spanish club are under no time pressure because they are banned by FIFA from registering any new players until the end of the year.\n\nAtletico, like Costa, are content to play a waiting game but there is logic to ensuring a move is completed before January. At least he could train with Diego Simeone and future team-mates and be closer to Spain manager Julen Lopetegui, who he must impress if he is to play at the World Cup next summer.\n\nExactly what Conte, already bristling at not getting everything his way, will make of a returning Costa is another matter.\n\nThe return of Costa will go down well with some players as he is a popular squad member\n\nThus far, he has refused to discuss the issue in public, other than to say his decision was made in January and that Costa has been aware of the position since then.\n\nWhen Conte texted Costa in June, he was in a position of tremendous personal strength after a magnificent debut season in the Premier League. He had transformed the team, won the title and made it to the FA Cup final.\n\nA new four-year contract was on the table and there was the promise of a major recruitment drive to build a squad capable of challenging in the Champions League. Two months on and Conte's status has been radically altered. Recruitment did not go to plan, top targets escaped and the four-year deal became a two-year deal as tensions increased.\n\nForm in pre-season was poor and the champions started the Premier League campaign with a 3-2 home defeat by Burnley.\n\nConte's side suffered a disappointing start to the league season, losing 3-2 at home to Burnley\n\nChelsea finished the game with nine men, adding to a feeling of disarray with echoes of 2015 when the title defence went awry under Jose Mourinho. Last month, Conte said he feared a repeat of 'the Mourinho season' and could be sacked.\n\nHis reservations about the strength of his squad were compounded by the sale of Nemanja Matic to Manchester United.\n\nWith Roman Abramovich's fondness for change and Conte's propensity to storm off in a huff, focus will sharpen on the manager's position if harmony cannot be restored. He is the book- makers' favourite to be the next manager to leave.\n\nHis contract runs until 2019 -- the same as Costa's -- and while no-one expects the striker to outlast Conte, anything can happen at Stamford Bridge.", "id": "9166262", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Could Diego Costa last longer at Chelsea than boss Antonio Conte?", "image":

He's earning a fortune at Chelsea. Can Atletico Madrid even afford him?\"\n\nCosta, who last played for Chelsea in the FA Cup final in May, joined the Blues from Atletico Madrid in 2014 and has won two Premier League titles and the League Cup with the London club.\n\nIn January, he was left out of the side for an away match at Leicester after he was involved in a dispute with a fitness coach.\n\nIt followed reports of an offer from China that would have been worth \u00a330m a year in salary.\n\n\"Why won't they let me go if they don't want me?\" he told the Daily Mail on Monday.\n\n\"In January, things happened with the coach. I was on the brink of renewing my contract and they put the brakes on it. I suspect the manager was behind it. He asked for that to happen.\n\n\"His ideas are very fixed and clear. I have seen the sort of person he is. He has his own opinion and that will not change.\"\n\n\"Antonio Conte has told me by message that I do not follow at Chelsea and that's it. Conte said he did not count on me for next season,\" said Costa in June.\n\nThat came after the Italian manager had sent a text to his players wishing them a good holiday and telling them to stay fit and Costa replied in a jokey way.\n\nBut Wright says he cannot understand why Chelsea would want to get rid of a forward who scored 20 goals in 35 Premier League games to help the Blues win the Premier League last season.\n\n\"Something has happened,\" added Wright, who played 33 times for England.\n\n\"For them to want to get rid of that kind of player, I can't understand how that's come about. I can't understand why you would get rid of definitely 20 goals? It doesn't make sense to me.\"\n\nFollowing the text message exchange with Conte, Costa said \"I love to live in Madrid\", despite Atletico being banned from signing players until the January transfer window.\n\n\"Why does it seem he is holding all the cards? He genuinely wants to go, but only wants to go to Atletico Madrid,\" added Wright.\n\n\"If Chelsea want to get rid of him and get bids for a player they don't want, they're not going to take them?\n\n\"I would like to see the text. Show us the text. Then I don't blame him, because I would have the hump over that.\"\n\nCosta said: \"I have not deleted the message. If people accuse me of lying, I can show them. It was clear, saying that he didn't count on me and wishing me the best for the future. Full stop.\"\n\nFormer Chelsea and Republic of Ireland midfielder Andy Townsend says Conte telling Costa he is not wanted at the club is like Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham telling their star forwards not to return.\n\n\"Something else is going on,\" he said. \"There's no logic from Chelsea's point of view to get rid of him.\n\n\"You don't send him a text and say 'off you pop, we don't want you to come back'. They don't do that. They don't just turn round with one of their main components and say 'go and find a new club'.\n\n\"It's like Jose Mourinho saying to Zlatan Ibrahimovic before he was injured, Arsene Wenger saying to Alexis Sanchez, Tottenham saying to Harry Kane 'don't come back'.

He didn't train in the week because he wasn't fit.\"\n\n:: January 16\n\nCosta trains on his own for a second successive day after missing the Leicester match, while his first-team colleagues enjoyed two days off.\n\n:: January 17\n\nThe owner of Tianjin Quanjian, who had been linked with a mega-money offer for Costa, says new rules in the Chinese Super League have altered their recruitment plans. But speculation gathers of a return to Atletico Madrid.\n\n:: January 20\n\nConte says Costa is available to play against Hull. The Italian adds: \"I think the player wants to stay at Chelsea. He's very happy to play with us. This idea (to move) is far from his mind. I'm sure about his commitment, his behaviours, his will to fight with this team, to try together to fight to the end to try to win the title.\"\n\n:: January 22\n\nCosta is restored to Chelsea's starting line-up at the first opportunity and scores his 52nd goal on his 100th Chelsea appearance in a 2-0 win over Hull. Conte says: \"I hope with this game to finish the speculation about him, about Chelsea, about me and him. We showed we are a team with great unity.\"\n\n:: January 31\n\nCosta has a penalty saved in a 1-1 Premier League draw at rivals Liverpool, on transfer deadline day.\n\n:: February 3\n\nWith the Chinese Super League transfer window still open and thoughts in Europe turning to the summer, speculation continues to swirl around Costa. Conte says: \"Every week I hear a lot of news, a lot of speculation about Diego. I think now the most important thing is to be focused on this championship.\"\n\n:: February 17\n\nConte says the future of all his players, including Costa, will be discussed at the end of the season as the focus should not waver from winning the Premier League title.\n\n:: May 8\n\nCosta scores his 20th goal of the Premier League season in a 3-0 win over Middlesbrough which takes the Blues within reach of the Premier League title.\n\n:: May 27\n\nChelsea lose the FA Cup final 2-1 to Arsenal. Costa scores his 59th goal for the Blues on his 120th appearance.\n\n:: May 28\n\nCosta insists he does not wish to move to China and only wants to move to Atletico if he leaves Chelsea. \"I have no intention of leaving, I'm very happy here, I have two years on my contract, but if the club want to sell me there is one club I would go to,\" Costa says.\n\n:: June 8\n\nCosta says Conte sent him a text message to tell the striker he is not in his plans next season.\n\n:: July 21\n\nOn Chelsea's pre-season tour to Asia, without Costa, Conte says the decision to cut the striker from his squad was made in January. The player and his agent, Jorge Mendes, were aware. \"The situation is closed,\" Conte adds.\n\n:: August 4\n\nA lawyer stating he represents Costa threatens legal action after the striker was told he was free to leave. Chelsea describe claims Conte is forcing out Costa as \"just nonsense\".\n\n:: August 11\n\nChelsea and Conte are tight-lipped on Costa as it emerges legal proceedings are taking place behind the scenes.\n\n:: August 14\n\nCosta criticises Chelsea's treatment of him this summer in an interview with The Daily Mail. He says he is \"not a criminal\" and is prepared to remain in exile in Brazil for a year.", "id": "9057611", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Timeline of events leading up to Diego Costa's Chelsea exile", "image": "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/article36029789.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/PANews%20BT_P-682fc4ab-fe0e-430a-8069-f1870ec408c1_I1.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-14", "concepts": [], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 220, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}], "time": "10:47:00"}

Chelsea's unwanted want-away striker is believed to have gone AWOL in his homeland.\n\nThe Sun reported on Friday that legal proceedings against Chelsea have been instigated by Costa's legal team. They believe Chelsea are blocking the Spanish/Brazilian's move back to his beloved Atletico Madrid.\n\nCosta hinted at a desire to move to China during last January's transfer window. It was something that didn't go down well in London with Antonio Conte.\n\nConte has since claimed that Costa and his agent were told that the striker would not be part of his plans for the season that has just begun. Whether a text was sent in the summer outlining this we don't know. Costa burnt his bridges though and subsequently decided against a move to Asia.\n\nFast forward and The Sun report that Chelsea are expressing a concern that Costa, who has not returned from Brazil, will be too fat to be sold. The Daily Star Chelsea consider Costa as AWOL and say he should have been back at the club two weeks ago, pending a transfer. They say he faces a two week wage fine, believed to be in the region of \u00a3300,000. Images appeared last week of Costa acting the clown in some sort of stage performance.\n\nCosta and his team are now apparently, according to The Mirror, seeking a loyalty bonus. You couldn't make it up.\n\nWhen asked about Costa at Friday's pre-match press conference, Conte simply said there was \"no news\" when asked about him and he \"didn't know\" when Costa would be back in London. Chelsea's press spokesman said there was \"nothing to report\".

But they wouldn't pay a fortune. Atletico is a team growing every year, but they can't pay an extraordinary amount.\n\nAsked if it would now be impossible to return to Chelsea, Costa revealed just how deep the schism has come to run:\n\nI'll be honest, I have my agent and none of that [negativity from inside the club] has reached me. People at the club called me before to give me extra holidays to not have contact with the manager.\n\nI was always meant to turn up with the group, but they were already saying that I'm going to have to come back and train with the reserves. I said that this was a lack of respect. We won the league and I haven't done anything so serious to deserve being treated in that way.\n\n[The relationship between me and Conte] won't be the same as before, and we don't know if the fight for the position will be fair.\n\nBecause of me having exposed the [text] message I understand that he'll be annoyed, so if I go back I have to see if things would be clean, just and correct.\n\nThat's how I like things. If I go back now I don't think it will be a fair situation. It won't be an honest fight for a place [in the team].\n\nWhat a dreadful hash Chelsea have made of cutting their first-choice striker adrift.\n\nOf course, we're only hearing Costa's 'butter wouldn't melt' version of events and we can't imagine he's entirely blameless, but still - you feel this is only going to get messier before the whole sorry palaver is resolved.", "id": "9895432", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Chelsea: Diego Costa Once Again Reiterates He Would Really, Really, Really Like To Return To Atletico Madrid If It's At All Possible, Thank You | Who Ate all the Pies", "image": "http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/costa-chelsea-atletico.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "30", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}, "id": "304434", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Antonio Conte"}, "id": "311374", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Conte"}, {"label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}, "id": "312748", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Diego Costa"}, "id": "313877", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Costa"}, {"label": {"eng": "ESPN Brasil"}, "id": "479112", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN_Brasil"}], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "12:05:00"}

He's earning a fortune at Chelsea. Can Atletico Madrid even afford him?\"\n\nCosta, who last played for Chelsea in the FA Cup final in May, joined the Blues from Atletico Madrid in 2014 and has won two Premier League titles and the League Cup with the London club.\n\nIn January, he was left out of the side for an away match at Leicester after he was involved in a dispute with a fitness coach.\n\nIt followed reports of an offer from China that would have been worth \u00a330m a year in salary.\n\n\"Why won't they let me go if they don't want me?\" he told the Daily Mail on Monday.\n\n\"In January, things happened with the coach. I was on the brink of renewing my contract and they put the brakes on it. I suspect the manager was behind it. He asked for that to happen.\n\n\"His ideas are very fixed and clear. I have seen the sort of person he is. He has his own opinion and that will not change.\"\n\n\"Antonio Conte has told me by message that I do not follow at Chelsea and that's it. Conte said he did not count on me for next season,\" said Costa in June.\n\nThat came after the Italian manager had sent a text to his players wishing them a good holiday and telling them to stay fit and Costa replied in a jokey way.\n\nBut Wright says he cannot understand why Chelsea would want to get rid of a forward who scored 20 goals in 35 Premier League games to help the Blues win the Premier League last season.\n\n\"Something has happened,\" added Wright, who played 33 times for England.\n\n\"For them to want to get rid of that kind of player, I can't understand how that's come about. I can't understand why you would get rid of definitely 20 goals? It doesn't make sense to me.\"\n\nFollowing the text message exchange with Conte, Costa said \"I love to live in Madrid\", despite Atletico being banned from signing players until the January transfer window.\n\n\"Why does it seem he is holding all the cards? He genuinely wants to go, but only wants to go to Atletico Madrid,\" added Wright.\n\n\"If Chelsea want to get rid of him and get bids for a player they don't want, they're not going to take them?\n\n\"I would like to see the text. Show us the text. Then I don't blame him, because I would have the hump over that.\"\n\nCosta said: \"I have not deleted the message. If people accuse me of lying, I can show them. It was clear, saying that he didn't count on me and wishing me the best for the future. Full stop.\"\n\nFormer Chelsea and Republic of Ireland midfielder Andy Townsend says Conte telling Costa he is not wanted at the club is like Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham telling their star forwards not to return.\n\n\"Something else is going on,\" he said. \"There's no logic from Chelsea's point of view to get rid of him.\n\n\"You don't send him a text and say 'off you pop, we don't want you to come back'. They don't do that. They don't just turn round with one of their main components and say 'go and find a new club'.\n\n\"It's like Jose Mourinho saying to Zlatan Ibrahimovic before he was injured, Arsene Wenger saying to Alexis Sanchez, Tottenham saying to Harry Kane 'don't come back'. It's the hardest thing to do, score goals, and you cannot afford to be that flippant with players like that.\"", "id": "9149219", "details": {"liCnt": 22}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Diego Costa:

While Antonio Conte is at Chelsea, Costa feels he cannot possibly return.\n\nDuring Sportsmail's interview, Costa described the Italian coach as 'distant', 'lacking charisma' and also implied that the Chelsea boss relies heavily on his backroom team for his man-management.\n\nDiego Costa invited Sportsmail into his family home back in Brazil for an exclusive interview\n\nThe Chelsea star spoke exclusively to Sportsmail's Adam Crafton about his future in the game\n\nCosta cares passionately about the club. He kicked every ball in his living room as Chelsea chased the game against Burnley. He continues to talk to his team-mates most days. However, a reconciliatory approach would be required from two hot-headed characters. Conte will not concede ground and Costa is not prepared to give an inch.\n\nAsked if he would answer an SOS call, Costa replied: 'You know the manager does not want me.'\n\nIt is clear that the 28-year-old cannot return to the London club while Antonio Conte is there\n\nEighty miles from the coast of Brazil, Costa is commemorated in his home town of Lagarto\n\nThe Chelsea star watched his side's home 3-2 defeat by Burnley during the opening weekend\n\nConte declared that Costa is 'in the past' after the 3-2 loss. So it would seem there is no way back. It is also true that Costa has a unique bond with Atletico Madrid. There are more photos of life in Spain than in London at his parents' home. Should Chelsea fail to agree a fee with Atletico, then Costa's credibility will be in doubt ahead of the World Cup.\n\nHe is likely to be left out of Spain's squad next month. Chelsea have a degree of strength. Yet Costa was not wrong when he highlighted his popularity.\n\nIndeed, Sportsmail understands Chelsea's players are bemused by the club's transfer market activity, with the key players cut adrift and the squad short of numbers.\n\nWHAT COSTA TOLD SPORTSMAIL...\n\n'The Premier League is the top. Chasing a game, with seconds to spare. I wouldn't be human if I didn't miss those moments.'\n\n'I am waiting for Chelsea to set me free. I didn't want to leave. I was happy. When the manager does not want you, you have to go.'\n\n'If you were to ask all my teammates, they'd say the same. They send messages saying 'I miss you' and that they love me.'\n\n'I am always talking with the boys -- particularly Cesc Fabregas, David Luiz and Willian.'\n\n'In January, things happened with the coach. I was on the brink of renewing my contract and they put the brakes on it. I suspect the manager was behind it.'\n\n'I respect him as a great coach. He has done a good job and I can see that, but as a person, no. He is not a coach who is very close with his players. He is very distant. He doesn't possess charisma.'\n\n'What is happening now with Chelsea is sad. The text message -- I understand it when a coach wants a different player. Alvaro Morata is a great player. He will triumph at Chelsea, but there are ways of going about it. You don't do it by text message. You should be honest and direct to someone's face.'\n\n'I have not deleted the message. If people accuse me of lying, I can show them.'\n\n'The worst bit of all this, it is for the fans. They have always treated me so well.'\n\n'They want me to be there training with the reserves.

Now, in the space of one summer, everything is going wrong for him.\n\nIt was interesting reading Sportsmail's interview on Wednesday with Dave Bassett, who said he should have visited Pierre van Hooijdonk when the Nottingham Forest forward went on strike in 1998. Why has no one at Chelsea flown out to Brazil to see Diego Costa?\n\nI find it a real shame that one of the best front players in the Premier League may have to leave.\n\nChelsea looked rudderless against Burnley without Costa, Pedro, Hazard and Matic -- who has somehow been allowed to leave and strengthen a rival team. Whatever happens, the Costa issue must be resolved quickly. Chelsea players are starting to sympathise with him -- they may well be worrying that they could be placed in a similar situation.\n\nConte needs to have a good look at himself and take charge of the situation.\n\nAtletico Madrid may reimburse Costa for his fines if a deal can be completed before the end of the summer window.\n\nChelsea have this week issued new demands for him to return but Costa publicly defied the club once more on Thursday.\n\nAfter holding a meeting with the Football Association of Sergipe, a state in north-east Brazil, Costa said: 'My destination is already made. I must return to Atletico Madrid.\n\n'There is an impasse as Chelsea do not want to release me.

should not be tied to a transfer market which has spiraled out of control.\n\n\"Fifpro is not in a position to comment on the specifics of the situation of either Diego Costa.\n\n\"However, we are aware of repeated instances of the financial interests of clubs interfering with the short career of players.\n\n\"Indeed, Fifpro's recent global survey of professional players found that 29 per cent

I was on the brink of renewing my contract and they put the brakes on it. I suspect the manager was behind it. He asked for that to happen.\n\n\"His ideas are very fixed and clear. I have seen the sort of person he is. He has his own opinion and that will not change. I respect him as a great coach. He has done a good job and I can see that, but as a person, no. He is not a coach who is very close with his players. He is very distant. He doesn't possess charisma.\"\n\n...\n\n\"I am waiting for Chelsea to set me free. I didn't want to leave. I was happy. When the manager does not want you, you have to go. If you were to ask all my team-mates, they'd say the same. They send messages saying \"I miss you\" and that they love me.\n\n\"I am always talking with the boys -- particularly Cesc Fabregas, David Luiz and Willian. We have banter over WhatsApp. They ask how I am. They really love me for the person I am. If they didn't, they wouldn't be saying they miss me and love me.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Why won't they let me go if they don't want me? I have to do what I have to do. I have to think of myself. I've been a good boy here and tried to do the right thing.\n\n\"My desire is to go to Atletico [Madrid]. I've spoken to Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia. I said, 'If the manager doesn't want me, I want to go to Atletico Madrid.' I have rejected other offers. They want to sell me to China or other teams. The language is better for me in Spain. If I'm off, I'm going to the club I want to go to -- not the club that's paying the most.\n\n\"Diego Simeone wants me. It is very clear. I have always had a bond with him. The fans and people love me there. They respect me.\"\n\n...\n\n\"They want me to be there training with the reserves. I wouldn't be allowed access to the first-team dressing room and I would have no contact at all with the guys. I'm not a criminal. I don't think it is fair after all I have done to be treated like that.\n\n\"They gave me a week extra off but since then it's fines all the way. They want me training with the reserves. I am not going to do that. I am not a criminal and I am not in the wrong here. So, if they need to fine me, let them fine me. I take the hit every week but I'm not driven by money. The important thing is to be happy with how I live.\"\n\n18 days remain in the summer transfer window in Spain.

The Costa problem does not help and there needs to be a solution ASAP because Chelsea need to move on.\"\n\nTony Cottee was also in the studio for Premier League Daily and the former England striker questioned Conte's handling of the Costa situation, adding Chelsea must replace the Brazil-born Spain international with someone who wants to play for the club.\n\n\"All these issues with Costa. He's sunbathing in Brazil. It's crazy,\" Cottee said.\n\n\"I think the mistake was the so-called text that he [Conte] has apparently sent to him. I think that is where the issue is. I know if I was Diego Costa and I received a text from my manager I would not be very happy about it.\n\n\"What's wrong with calling the player in and sitting down man-to-man and thrashing it out. If you want the player to move on, tell him to his face. It's obviously upset Costa, and Costa is now doing what he is doing, which is the normal process for players that are unhappy - they disappear and everything else.\n\n\"He's their best striker and he's on holiday in Brazil. Like Jimmy says, if he is not going to play just get rid of him. Sell him, get rid of him and move on.\n\n\"The bottom line is if you have an unhappy player at your football club you have to move them on. Do whatever you have got to do to move him on and get the money in and spend it on a player that wants to play.\"\n\nCosta has his heart set on a return to Atletico Madrid and Sky Sports' Spanish football expert Guillem Balague says the current situation suits the Spanish club perfectly.\n\n\"It feels quite clear that he's got one plan. That plan is to go to Atletico Madrid,\" Balague said.\n\n\"Atletico have told him for a while to sit tight and that the longer you sit the cheaper you will be but I'm not sure that's something Chelsea will want to deal with.\n\n\"They say there's a price for him and Atletico are saying sit tight. He won't be able to play for Atletico until January because of the transfer ban so it's just a matter of it being a chess game.\"\n\nAlso See: Azpilicueta: We need top players 'Conte causing unnecessary problems' What next for Diego Costa?

Of course he's not.\n\nCosta threatens Chelsea strike\n\nDiego Costa has launched a scathing attack on Antonio Conte and Chelsea from his home town in Brazil.\n\n\"I think the player has done this wrong. Forget the text, so what if he was hurt by it? He should have come back, he should get himself ready to go but he should make it absolutely clear to Conte that he doesn't want to stay and play for him.\n\n\"If he said that, I'm sure things would start moving a bit quicker. All of this bravado from the other side of the world isn't getting him anywhere quick. Do your work, do your training, pick your wages up, appear to be a good pro on the face of it and be ready for selection but you can make it loud and clear in other ways that your time is done.\n\n\"The communication here has got so lost along the line. To be champions one minute and when there is a dearth of fantastic No 9's around the world, he is one of them. As an asset, Chelsea are losing millions on this guy. It defies any logic really.\"\n\nHis sentiments were echoed by former striker Wright, who says Costa has shown 'terrible professionalism' by choosing to stay in Brazil and should go about the situation in a different way.\n\n\"He should be back at Chelsea training. It says in his contract that you have to be there fit and ready if selected whatever happens,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know if somewhere along the line, that's gone out of the window with players because as soon as they don't want to be there, they go on strike. He's still in Brazil and the season has started and he's not fit. He should have reported back for pre-season and it is terrible professionalism.\n\nTottenham vs Chelsea\n\nAugust 20, 2017, 3:30pm\n\nLive on\n\nGet Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass\n\n\"I think that the vibe I get off of it is that Conte is delighted that he's not in and around the place. Costa should have read the situation properly and thought 'if I'm around, it's going to irk him even more'. I feel like that's the scenario Costa should have gone down.\n\n\"I get the impression from Conte that if Costa's around [the club] and he's in [Conte's] face, that's going to be a problem and that's what Costa should be doing. Him and his agents have read it wrong.\"\n\nWatch The Debate every week night from 10pm on Sky Sports Premier League.\n\nAlso See: Costa threatens Chelsea strike Costa 'expected back at Chelsea' 'Inevitable Costa will join Atleti' Transfer Centre", "id": "9370217", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Diego Costa should be back at Chelsea, according to Andy Townsend and Ian Wright", "image": "http://e2.365dm.com/17/03/150x150/skysports-diego-costa-chelsea-football-premier-league_3914052.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2923, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2938}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "30", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}, "id": "304434", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "id": "305737", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}, "id": "306192", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}, "id": "306207", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}, "id": "307492", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail"}, {"label": {"eng": "Antonio Conte"}, "id": "311374", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Conte"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}, "id": "313349", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports"}, {"label": {"eng": "Diego Costa"}, "id": "313877", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Costa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ian Wright"}, "id": "362609", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Wright"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil"}, "id": "443583", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_the_Portuguese_Court_to_Brazil"}, {"label": {"eng": "Andy Townsend"}, "id": "633061", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Townsend"}], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "22:45:00"}

I can't see that now as it will take him a month to get fit from doing his own training back home, as he is based in Brazil at the moment and has not had a pre-season.\n\n\"I can't see an ideal club where he would go out on loan which would serve the purpose, so it may well be that, just as with Arda Turan and Aleix Vidal did, they have to sit and be patient, miss the least important part of the season from now till January.\n\n\"Atletico should get through the qualifying stages and cope in the Champions League, they should still be challenging in La Liga come the January transfer window and then it maybe is beneficial to have a player like Costa back.\n\nGirona vs A Madrid\n\nAugust 19, 2017, 7:40pm\n\nLive on\n\nGet Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass\n\n\"I can imagine the training sessions he will be put through if he signs for Atletico in November or December to make sure he is ready for January.\n\n\"So a hungry Diego Costa in January could cause havoc in La Liga.\"\n\nAlso See: Costa 'expected back to Chelsea' Carra calls for Chelsea calm Chelsea hit Costa with fine Problems facing Chelsea", "id": "9324447", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Diego Costa rejoining Atletico Madrid is inevitable, says Terry Gibson", "image": "http://e0.365dm.com/17/06/150x150/skysports-diego-costa-chelsea_3976578.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1723, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1738}, {"textStart": 3218, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3233}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "30", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Comunidad de Madrid"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "149322", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "label": {"eng": "Comunidad de Madrid"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}, "id": "304434", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}, "id": "304606", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "La Liga"}, "id": "305674", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga"}, {"label": {"eng": "Loan (sports)"}, "id": "306188", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan_(sports)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}, "id": "306207", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "id": "307959", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window"}, {"label": {"eng": "Antonio Conte"}, "id": "311374", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Conte"}, {"label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}, "id": "312748", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}, "id": "313349", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer (association football)"}, "id": "313860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(association_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Diego Costa"}, "id": "313877", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Costa"}, {"label": {"eng": "Diego Simeone"}, "id": "320656", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Simeone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Arda Turan"}, "id": "338124", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda_Turan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Football in Spain"}, "id": "340069", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Spain"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terry Gibson"}, "id": "762529", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Gibson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aleix Vidal"}, "id": "1095536", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleix_Vidal"}], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "17:08:00"}

search for another club, reports Efe.\n\n\"My destination is already made,\" Costa said in a statement. \"I must return to Atletico Madrid.\"\n\n\"It turns out that there is the impasse that Chelsea does not want to release me,\" Costa added. \"But I believe that this situation will be resolved now on my return to Spain.\"\n\nThe Brazilian-born forward has been in Brazil since last season ended, but the English Premier League's defending champions have expressed their wish to have him join their current training sessions.\n\nCosta's attorney, Ricardo Cardoso, confirmed last week his client's intention to present a transfer request to the Blues.\n\nCardoso did not rule out taking legal action against Chelsea to ensure his departure from Stamford Bridge.\n\nChelsea, who paid 32 million pounds ($41.2 million) to sign Costa in 2014 from Atletico, seeks a 50-million pound (around $64 million) bid to let him leave, which is 26 million pounds ($33 million) more than what the La Liga side is offering.\n\nIf a deal were to be finally reached, Costa would not be able to play with Atletico during the first half of the season due to FIFA's ban that prevents the Spanish club from registering new players until January 2018, so he would presumably be transferred on loan to another club in the interim.\n\n--IANS\n\ntri/dg\n\nSEARCH", "id": "9708248", "details": {}, "date":

Overnight the next episode has been released. The Brazilian born Spanish international has given an exclusive interview to The Daily Mail. Adam Crafton from the Mail arrived at Costa's family home during the game against Burnley on Saturday. Crafton had arrived unannounced but Costa let him in.\n\n\"It's going well for Chelsea, isn't it? The red card changed the game but anyway, you've come a long way and I have nothing to hide. Come on in.\"\n\nCosta has a lot to say. In the article he speaks about everything that has gone on. He accuses Chelsea as treating him like a criminal and of Conte, who he says lacks charisma, blocking his contract negotiations in January. He claims he has been fined several weeks wages but is refusing to train with the reserves. His preferred option being a move to Atletico Madrid, failing that he is happy to run out his contract unpaid in Brazil.\n\nAs the Chelsea game reaches it's climax and David Luiz scores, Costa is off the sofa celebrating.\n\n\"I wouldn't be human if I didn't miss those moments.\"\n\nCosta is not expecting a call from Conte.\n\n\"You know that the manager doesn't want me.I am waiting for Chelsea to set me free. I didn't want to leave. I was happy. When the manager does not want you, you have to go.\n\nCosta claims the players keep in touch with him, in particular, Cesc Fabregas, Willian and David Luiz. The striker has also received a message of support from former manager Jose Mourinho. Costa's malice appears to be toward the current manager only.\n\nWhen talk of Antonio Conte's text message surfaces he says,\n\n\"I was with the Spain national team, alone in my room, when it came through. It was a shock to get it like that. I was showing it to my team-mates and they could not believe how he had done it. I was angry at the time. Now I am more calm. I have not deleted the message. If people accuse me of lying, I can show them. It was clear, saying that he didn't count on me and wishing me the best for the future.

say when he would be returning to Spain, but his preferred move is complicated by Atletico's transfer embargo, which forbids them from registering new players until January.\n\nThe statement from the Sergipe FA is the first sign that Costa is prepared to use official channels to negotiate his departure from Stamford Bridge.\n\nPress Association Sport understands Costa has not yet contacted FIFA, football's world governing body, over his concerns.\n\nAnd FIFPro, the global players' union, is yet to by contacted by Costa.\n\nBut FIFPro has general concerns about the trade of players through transfers.\n\nA FIFPro statement said: \"We strongly believe that players at every level of the football pyramid should have the same right as workers in other industries to follow the career path of their choice.\n\n\"A footballer's career should not be tied to a transfer market which has spiraled out of control.\n\n\"FIFPro is not in a position to comment on the specifics of the situation of either Diego Costa.\n\n\"However, we are aware of repeated instances of the financial interests of clubs interfering with the short career of players.\n\n\"Indeed, FIFPro's recent global survey of professional players found that 29 per cent of those traded for a transfer fee to their current club were unhappy with the move.\"", "id": "9663692", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "'My

My idea would be to go to Madrid, train there, get in the best physical shape and be ready to fire ahead of the World Cup.\"\n\nThe situation is complicated by the fact that Atletico are currently banned from signing players in this window although a loan deal would be possible.\n\nCosta's relationship with Conte appears to have broken down although the Brazilian accepts the Italian \"is a good coach\".\n\nLast week Conte said there was \"no news\" on the Costa situation but earlier this summer said the \"situation is closed.\" (Reporting by Neil Robinson; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)", "id": "9044865", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Chelsea treating me like a criminal, says Costa", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 0, "date": "2017-08-14", "amb": false, "textEnd": 6}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-14", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "30", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "109", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Comunidad de Madrid"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "149322", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "label": {"eng": "Comunidad de Madrid"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "id": "302588", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}, "id": "304434", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Loan (sports)"}, "id": "306188", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan_(sports)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}, "id": "307492", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "id": "307959", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window"}, {"label": {"eng": "Antonio Conte"}, "id": "311374", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Conte"}, {"label": {"eng": "Burnley F.C."}, "id": "311434", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}, "id": "312748", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}, "id": "313161", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association"}, {"label": {"eng": "Diego Costa"}, "id": "313877", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Costa"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 256, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 728, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems"}], "time": "09:35:00"}

No, it was Antonio Conte's Chelsea side eating shit in hilarious and futile fashion to fucking Burnley, the team who scored the fewest goals of any top-flight team that escaped relegation last year. After dumbass Gary Cahill picked up a red card just 14 minutes in, Burnley turned on the jets and bagged three goals within halftime. Chelsea ended up scoring twice, losing Cesc Fabregas in the 81st minute, and eventually falling to the Clarets, 3-2. It owned so hard.\n\nNotably absent from the party was disgruntled Brazilian/Spanish striker Diego Costa. When he's on, Costa is a terrifying maniac of a striker, capable of wrecking defenses with thunderous runs and strong finishes. He scored 20 goals last season and was the top forward in the league for a good chunk of time,\n\nHowever, he's also a notoriously difficult personality who loves to fight and even as Chelsea were cruising to a league title last season, Costa was already butting heads with manager Antonio Conte. He got into a \"row\" with a fitness coach, then was dropped from the lineup before a marquee matchup with Leicester and reportedly told to take his ass to China. Costa got \"excused\" from preseason training while Chelsea spent the summer making eyes at every available striker in the world before finally signing young Spanish star \u00c1lvaro Morata for \u00a358 million.\n\nWhich brings us to this weekend, which Costa apparently spent watching Chelsea play while relaxing at his home in northeastern Brazil until a reporter from the Daily Mail just sort of showed up and got to watch it all unfold with him. Adam Crafton says he arrived at Costa's house in Lagarto right after Burnley scored their third goal, and got to hang with the Costa family. The results were delightful.\n\n'It's going well for Chelsea, isn't it?' he grimaces. 'The red card changed the game but anyway, you've come a long way and I have nothing to hide. Come on in.'\n\nCosta, who hasn't been with Chelsea since May, is all set to leave the club however he can, and he's been training by himself in Brazil while waiting for a transfer (ideally to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid). Costa would rather take the bath that comes with skipping out on his contract than train in London. He is no fan of Antonio Conte and didn't say he'd rule out legal action against the club, while also excoriating the manager.\n\nCosta's summer began with a text message from Conte, informing him his Chelsea career was over. Costa has not been at Chelsea since the FA Cup final in May and, during a half-hour conversation, the striker delivers a blistering retort.\n\nHe accuses Chelsea of treating him 'like a criminal' and refuses to rule out legal action. He says he will always keep Conte's text message on his phone and claims the Chelsea manager 'lacks charisma'. Costa also accuses Conte of blocking his contract negotiations in January.\n\nCosta said he respected Conte's soccer mind but basically called him a moron, a dick, and a coward.\n\n'What is happening now with Chelsea is sad,' he says. 'The text message -- I understand it when a coach wants a different player.\n\n'Alvaro Morata is a great player. He had a great season in Madrid and actually with the way this crazy transfer market is, I think they got a good price for a young and talented forward. He will triumph at Chelsea, but there are ways of going about it. You don't do it by text message. You should be honest and direct to someone's face.\n\n'I was with the Spain national team, alone in my room, when it came through. It was a shock to get it like that. I was showing it to my team-mates and they could not believe how he had done it.\n\n'I was angry at the time. Now I am more calm. I have not deleted the message. If people accuse me of lying, I can show them. It was clear, saying that he didn't count on me and wishing me the best for the future. Full stop.'\n\nBut it wasn't all shit talking and chest-puffing from Costa. He misses his buddies! They love him!\n\n'If you were to ask all my team-mates, they'd say the same. They send messages saying \"I miss you\" and that they love me.\n\n'I am always talking with the boys -- particularly Cesc Fabregas, David Luiz and Willian.

I was on the brink of renewing my contract and they put the brakes on it. I suspect the manager was behind it. He asked for that to happen.\n\n\"His ideas are very fixed and clear. I have seen the sort of person he is. He has his own opinion and that will not change. I respect him as a great coach. He has done a good job and I can see that, but as a person, no. He is not a coach who is very close with his players. He is very distant. He doesn't possess charisma.\"\n\n...\n\n\"I am waiting for Chelsea to set me free. I didn't want to leave. I was happy. When the manager does not want you, you have to go. If you were to ask all my team-mates, they'd say the same. They send messages saying \"I miss you\" and that they love me.\n\n\"I am always talking with the boys -- particularly Cesc Fabregas, David Luiz and Willian. We have banter over WhatsApp. They ask how I am. They really love me for the person I am. If they didn't, they wouldn't be saying they miss me and love me.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Why won't they let me go if they don't want me? I have to do what I have to do. I have to think of myself. I've been a good boy here and tried to do the right thing.\n\n\"My desire is to go to Atletico [Madrid]. I've spoken to Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia. I said, 'If the manager doesn't want me, I want to go to Atletico Madrid.' I have rejected other offers. They want to sell me to China or other teams. The language is better for me in Spain.

The fans and people love me there. They respect me.\"\n\n...\n\n\"They want me to be there training with the reserves. I wouldn't be allowed access to the first-team dressing room and I would have no contact at all with the guys. I'm not a criminal. I don't think it is fair after all I have done to be treated like that.\n\n\"They gave me a week extra off but since then it's fines all the way. They want me training with the reserves. I am not going to do that. I am not a criminal and I am not in the wrong here. So, if they need to fine me, let them fine me. I take the hit every week but I'm not driven by money.

The 28-year-old striker has since decided he would rather return to Atletico Madrid, but the clubs are not close to an agreement.\n\nTalks have stalled and Costa's lawyers want him released on a free transfer because his contract has been breached by Conte's message.

He was then omitted from a tour of China and Singapore, but hopes of a swift resolution soon disappeared.\n\nCosta is in his home town of Lagarto in Brazil and, in an exclusive Sportsmail interview, published on Sunday, he claimed Chelsea were treating him like a criminal. He vowed to continue training alone in South America rather than report back to work with the reserves in Surrey with no prospect of playing. 'That seems a very bad and ugly life,' said Costa.

He asked for that to happen. His ideas are very fixed and clear. I have seen the sort of person he is. He has his own opinion and that will not change. I respect him as a great coach.

In an interview with the Daily Mail, Costa explained Chelsea have demanded he return to the club but will not allow him access to the first-team dressing room and would force him to train with their Under-23 side.\n\nThe striker has remained defiant, choosing to remain in his homeland despite fines racking up every week.

They don't have to put in a \u00a350m, \u00a340m or \u00a330m bid.

He has made his position clear.\n\nOver the next few weeks, he intends to force through a return to Atletico, to be reunited with boss Diego Simeone in their sparkly new stadium on the outskirts of the city.\n\nFor some reason, he never quite took to life in London.\n\nThe neighbours frequently complained to the club about his late night parties and his fondness for a traditional Brazilian BBQ went too far.\n\nEven learning the language seemed too much of a chore for a player who relied on a translator whenever he needed to speak to a Chelsea official.\n\nWhen he was scoring goals - 20 in the league during last season's title triumph - Chelsea indulged him, protected him, lauded him.\n\nThey overlooked his frequent transgressions, his party-loving lifestyle and explosive, combustible personality. Instead, Chelsea seem to enjoy having him around the place.\n\nAlong with David Luiz, he was always one of the first to put his name forward when the club had visits from charities or from disadvantaged kids.\n\nThat manner, his ability to put a smile on the face of children and his fun-loving personality impressed the Stamford Bridge hierarchy.\n\nThey warmed to his petulant, mischievous manner, not to mention his goals.\n\nAnd he is a loss to the Premier League, of sorts.\n\nThis stand-off has put Chelsea in a tricky position with the 40,000 fans who idolised him, worshipped him and took to loving him.\n\nThey sold him as one of their own - presenting him as blue through and through when he tangled with Premier League defenders.\n\nHis iconic status and his relationship with the fans, means the club are tip-toeing around the issue as they cannot afford to alienate the supporters. Chelsea are aware that the fans, whatever the rights and wrongs of this grisly episode, would take him back in a heartbeat.\n\nThis loveable rogue, 28, signed from Atletico by Jose Mourinho in July 2014, could easily set their pulses racing again.\n\nThey would flutter their eyelashes and think back to that majestic double one-two against Southampton last April before he beat Fraser Forster from close range.\n\nThey would laugh at the time when he lifted his armpits and gestured to Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross that he pen and inks.\n\nOr they would get giddy about the moment that he ambushed Antonio Conte's title-winning press conference at the Hawthorns by threatening to set off a fire extinguisher.\n\nBut Costa is an old flame now. His lawyers are relying on the text message Conte sent, without the authorisation of the Chelsea board, to get him out this hole.\n\nWhile he is in it, digging himself deeper and deeper, Chelsea have taken to fining him one week's wages for each week he does not show up at Cobham.\n\nCosta being Costa, he intends to fight it.\n\nWhen it comes to the crunch, the Blues, of course, have some ammo of their own. To start with, there are the four separate transfers requests Costa has made since Conte arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2016.\n\nAfter the first, during the club's pre-season tour to America that summer, Costa refused to train for three days.\n\nHe made a further attempt to get away before the season started, another in January when he wanted to move to China and now this.\n\nIt has disrupted Chelsea's preparations for the season - far more than anybody ever realised before last Saturday's chaotic 3-2 home defeat against Burnley.\n\nThey will be missing captain Gary Cahill and Cesc Fabregas against Tottenham at Wembley on Sunday after their red cards on the opening weekend.\n\nAnd Conte will also be without another player, a guy who could have made all the difference on a day like that.\n\nSadly, Costa will never be able to pull on that blue shirt again.", "id": "9792211", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Diego Costa's potential exit leaves sour taste for Chelsea fans who worshipped him at Stamford Bridge", "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/08/sport-preview-ashton1.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=620&h=413&crop=1", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3077, "date": "2014-07-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3086}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stadium"}, "id": "303933", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}, "id": "304433", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}, "id": "304434", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}, "id": "306192", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Hawthorns"}, "id": "307093", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hawthorns"}, {"label": {"eng": "Antonio Conte"}, "id": "311374", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Conte"}, {"label": {"eng": "Southampton F.C."}, "id": "311377", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}, "id": "312748", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer (association football)"}, "id": "313860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(association_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Diego Costa"}, "id": "313877", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Costa"}, {"label": {"eng": "David Luiz"}, "id": "318260", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Luiz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Diego Simeone"}, "id": "320656", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Simeone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stoke City F.C."}, "id": "322883", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_City_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Fraser Forster"}, "id": "460420", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_Forster"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryan Shawcross"}, "id": "511485", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Shawcross"}, {"label": {"eng": "Royal Hospital Chelsea"}, "id": "781620", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Hospital_Chelsea"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 220, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth"}], "time": "23:09:00"}

Sergipe is the region of Brazil where Costa is from.\n\nIn a statement released by Federacao Sergipana de Futebol and published by O Globo, Costa said: \"My destiny is already set. I must return to Atletico Madrid next season. There happens to be an impasse as Chelsea do not want to release me.\n\n\"But I believe this situation will be resolved upon my return to Spain.\"\n\nHe did not say when he would be returning to Spain, but his preferred move is complicated by Atletico's transfer embargo, which forbids them from registering new players until January.\n\nCosta has not yet contacted Fifa, football's world governing body, over his concerns. And FIFPro, the global players' union, is yet to by contacted by Costa.\n\nBut FIFPro has general concerns about the trade of players through transfers.\n\nA FIFPro statement said: \"We strongly believe that players at every level of the football pyramid should have the same right as workers in other industries to follow the career path of their choice.\n\n\"A footballer's career should not be tied to a transfer market which has spirraled out of control.\n\n\"FIFPro is not in a position to comment on the specifics of the situation of either Diego Costa.\n\n\"However, we are aware of repeated instances of the financial interests of clubs interfering with the short career of players.\n\nMeanwhile Tottenham look set to run out in front of a near Premier League record crowd for their first home match at Wembley against Chelsea on Sunday, but have not been able to put tickets on full general sale at the 90,000-seater national stadium.\n\nSpurs have relocated Wembley, where they played last season's home Champions League fixtures, while White Hart Lane is being redeveloped, a project which eventually see the north London club return to a new 61,559-capacity venue.\n\nBrent Council has allowed Tottenham to use Wembley's full seat allocation of 90,000 for every home match, but restrictions have been put in place on the Chelsea fixture following discussions with the stadium's Safety Advisory Group.\n\nAs such only those Spurs fans who were registered on the club's database before July 1 2017 are permitted to purchase seats during the restricted general sale window, a measure which aims to prevent any away supporters from gaining access to the designated home sections at Wembley.\n\nThe current record attendance for a Premier League match stands at 76,073 when Manchester United played Aston Villa at Old Trafford in January 2007.\n\nTicket sales for Spurs game against Chelsea have already passed the 70,000 mark, including an allocation of some 3,000 to away fans, with still three days left before the game which is set to be broadcast live on Sky Sports.\n\nGiven the segregation which is required to be in place around the stadium, as well as the restrictions on sales the club are permitted to make, it is unlikely, though, that Sunday's match will provide a bigger attendance than the 85,512 for a Champions League fixture against Bayer Leverkusen last season which was a record crowd for an English club.\n\nEach Spurs match at Wembley is considered by the stadium's Safety Advisory Group on an individual basis, with tickets for Burnley on August 27 currently available on general sale as should be those for visit of Swansea on September 16.", "id": "9800083", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Diego Costa still

It's understood the Italian tactician has grown fed up with Costa's antics.\n\nCosta is currently in Brazil, refusing to train with the club.\n\nBut according to Wright, this only plays into Conte's hands. The former Arsenal striker thinks that Costa could cause more problems for Conte if he returned - which is what he should do.\n\n'He should be back at Chelsea training. It says in his contract that you have to be there fit and ready if selected whatever happens,' the former England striker told Sky Sports.\n\n'I don't know if somewhere along the line, that's gone out of the window with players because as soon as they don't want to be there, they go on strike.

Costa should have read the situation properly and thought \"if I'm around, it's going to irk him even more\". I feel like that's the scenario Costa should have gone down.\n\n'I get the impression from Conte that if Costa's around [the club] and he's in [Conte's] face, that's going to be a problem and that's what Costa should be doing.

The 28-year-old still has two years to run on his Chelsea contract, and although manager Antonio Conte has informed the Spain striker he is not in his plans, the club fully expect Costa to return to training and make himself available for selection as a Chelsea player.\n\nCosta said last week he felt Chelsea had treated him \"like a criminal\" for ordering him to train away from Conte's first-team group and for fining him for failing to report to pre-season training. Chelsea have dismissed Costa's latest comments, as reported by the Brazilian newspaper O Globo. The club retain their stance that they expect him to return as a Chelsea player and adhere to his contract, of which has two years to run.\n\n\"My destination is already set,\" Costa said. \"I must return to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid next season. \"It turns out that there is the impasse that Chelsea does not want to release me. But I believe that this situation will be resolved now on my return to Spain.\"\n\nCosta signed a five-year contract after joining Chelsea from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid for \u00a332m three years ago, and the Spanish club are yet to come close to agreeing a fee to re-sign the striker, despite him agitating for a move away from Stamford Bridge. Costa has said he has rejected offers from Chinese clubs because he is determined to link up with Diego Simeone's side, although any possible transfer to Atl\u00e9tico is complicated by the clubs' transfer embargo, which forbids them from registering new players until January.\n\n\"If I'm off, I'm going to the club I want to go to - not the club that's paying the most,\" he said. \"I want the deal with Atl\u00e9tico resolved this month.

The fans and people love me there. They respect me. They see me as a person and a footballer.\"\n\nCosta, meanwhile, has already threatened to see out his contract if Chelsea do not agree to sanction his sale this summer.\n\n\"If I have to I will stay in Brazil,\" Costa said. \"I am open to being a year in Brazil without playing, even if Chelsea fine me for a year and don't pay me.

Chelsea have identified Barkley as a transfer target in order to boost their homegrown quota and are currently three players short of the Premier League's minimum homegrown requirements.

The German champions are ready to let Sanches depart a year after he joined the club, even if it is on loan. Chelsea have been interested in the 19 year-old but Sanches has reportedly snubbed the Blues in favour of AC Milan where he can expect more first team opportunities.\n\nGetty Images\n\n5/6 Fabinho 3/10\n\nManchester United hotly pursued a move for Monaco's defensive midfielder before turning their attention to Matic. Fabinho caught the eyes of Europe's elite when staring in Monaco's title winning side but the French club are determined to hold onto the Brazilian. In a statement Monaco's vice president made it very clear that Fabinho is an 'essential player' and will be staying. Chelsea have already prised away on of Monaco's central midfielders when they spent \u00a335million on Tiemoue Bakayoko which makes Fabinho an unlikely prospect.\n\nBongarts/Getty Images\n\n6/6 Eric Dier 3/10\n\nTottenham were reluctant to let Manchester United speak to Eric Dier who was reportedly open to a move away from Spurs.

The fiery Spain international is attracting interest from AC Milan and Atletico Madrid but is currently training alone, with a move away from the capital far from completion.\n\nChelsea are intent on selling Costa, who they value at \u00a344m (\u20ac48.6m, $57.3m) but Townsend thinks the club are seeing the forward's value decrease due to the needless stand-off.\n\nTownsend, who enjoyed a three-year stint at Chelsea between 1990 and 1993, says Costa should be trying to disrupt Conte's plans at the champions' training complex in Cobham instead of sulking 5,500 miles away in Brazil, where he is \"not a problem\" for the Italian.\n\n\"As a player, if he wanted to get under Conte's skin and get out of the club, he should have come back.

And I'd be knocking on the owner's door asking him to take the problem away. But sitting in Brazil, he's not a problem to Conte.\n\n\"If a move happens tomorrow, are you telling me he's in the best shape to turn up at a new club and start playing? Of course he's not. I think the player has done this wrong. Forget the text, so what if he was hurt by it?\n\n\"He should have come back, he should get himself ready to go but he should make it absolutely clear to Conte that he doesn't want to stay and play for him. If he said that, I'm sure things would start moving a bit quicker. All of this bravado from the other side of the world isn't getting him anywhere quick.\n\n\"Do your work, do your training, pick your wages up, appear to be a good pro on the face of it and be ready for selection but you can make it loud and clear in other ways that your time is done. The communication here has got so lost along the line. To be champions one minute and when there is a dearth of fantastic No 9's around the world, he is one of them.\n\n\"As an asset, Chelsea are losing millions on this guy. It defies any logic really.\"\n\nChelsea recently ordered Costa to return to training and make himself available to Conte, but the former Rayo Vallecano is unlikely to bow to his club's wishes and believes he has been treated like a \"criminal\" by the Blues, who are preparing to head to Wembley for their clash with Tottenham on Sunday (20 August).", "id": "9437452", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Diego Costa should return to Chelsea in order to accelerate exit, says Andy Townsend", "image": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1624209/diego-costa-antonio-conte.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 2899, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2908}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "30", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "109", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}, "id": "304434", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "id": "305737", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"}, {"label": {"eng": "A.C.

The first is straightforward, that he should return to the club. The second is that he should report for training, the third that he get match fit and the fourth, and most surprising, that he put himself into contention for first-team selection.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been in dispute with Chelsea's coach, Antonio Conte, since the turn of the year when the Brazilian-born Spain international was upbraided for a row with the fitness coach Julio Tous. After a disappointing second half to last season, Conte told the player he was surplus to requirements by text message, the contents of which Costa then made public.\n\nCosta is believed to have been absent without leave from Chelsea since the club flew to China for a pre-season tour in the middle of July. The club have refused to discuss the nature of any disciplinary proceedings against the player, but Costa claimed in his interview with the Daily Mail that he has had his wages docked since that time.\n\nThe ensuing stand-off led to Chelsea's most prized forward watching his club's opening defeat by Burnley on his parent's TV in the Brazilian city of Lagarto. Chelsea's intervention in the dispute has at least set out the club's stall but it looks unlikely to defuse the situation, at least in the short term.\n\nCosta now knows the conditions through which he can make peace with the club. But while there are precedents for such disputes ending with the player returning to the field, as Carlos Tevez did for Manchester City after absconding to Argentina in 2010, such an outcome would seem unlikely.\n\nPerhaps the best Costa can hope for is to engender some goodwill, helping him work towards his preferred resolution: a return to his former club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Atl\u00e9tico, however, have yet to meet Chelsea's valuation for the player. They remain an interested party watching on as a struggle for power between player and employee continues.\n\nCosta signed for Chelsea from Atl\u00e9tico in the summer of 2014 for \u00a332m.

Yes, says The Sun with the paper claiming that the sulky Spanish sharpshooter is \"set for a shock loan move to Everton\".\n\nCurrently bumming around in Brazil, Costa is no longer on speaking terms with Chelsea and was this week fined \u00a3300,000 for his failure to report back to training last month. While Atletico Madrid remain the most likely destination for Costa, the Sun says that Toffees boss Ronald Koeman is contemplating \"making a move for the temperamental forward\".\n\nKoeman had been unsuccessful in his attempts to lure Oliver Giroud from Arsenal and it appears he's now turned his attention to Costa, even if it's only until January, when he's expected to sign for Atletico after the lifting of their transfer ban.\n\n\"Of course you like to sign players for the future, but if you can get the best one that way, then why not?\" said Koeman, when asked about the Costa rumours. \"That's for six months, the season, two years. It's difficult because it needs to be a quality player, or a young player who can develop or improve.\"\n\nCosta falls into the former category and it's believed that he would be ready to return to England on the strict proviso he signs for Atletico as soon as the January transfer window opens.\n\nMeanwhile the Daily Star says that the Blues \"are ready to up their offer\" for Arsenal star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Their initial bid of \u00a325m was rejected by the Gunners and so the Star claims that Chelsea boss Antonio Conte is \"now ready to shell out \u00a340m on him\".

He should be here with a big smile on his face every day,\" the former Blues midfielder told The Debate.\n\n\"Conte looks like the type of man that thinks 'if you get in the way of what I really want to do every day, you are going to bug me and annoy me'. And I'd be knocking on the owner's door asking him to take the problem away.\n\n\"But sitting in Brazil, he's not a problem to Conte. If a move happens tomorrow, are you telling me he's in the best shape to turn up at a new club and start playing? Of course he's not.\n\n\"I think the player has done this wrong. Forget the text, so what if he was hurt by it? He should have come back, he should get himself ready to go but he should make it absolutely clear to Conte that he doesn't want to stay and play for him.\n\n\"If he said that, I'm sure things would start moving a bit quicker. All of this bravado from the other side of the world isn't getting him anywhere quick. Do your work, do your training, pick your wages up, appear to be a good pro on the face of it and be ready for selection but you can make it loud and clear in other ways that your time is done.\n\n\"The communication here has got so lost along the line. To be champions one minute and when there is a dearth of fantastic No 9's around the world, he is one of them. As an asset, Chelsea are losing millions on this guy. It defies any logic really.\"\n\nHis sentiments were echoed by former striker Wright, who says Costa has shown 'terrible professionalism' by choosing to stay in Brazil and should go about the situation in a different way.\n\n\"He should be back at Chelsea training. It says in his contract that you have to be there fit and ready if selected whatever happens,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know if somewhere along the line, that's gone out of the window with players because as soon as they don't want to be there, they go on strike. He's still in Brazil and the season has started and he's not fit. He should have reported back for pre-season and it is terrible professionalism.\n\n\"I think that the vibe I get off of it is that Conte is delighted that he's not in and around the place. Costa should have read the situation properly and thought 'if I'm around, it's going to irk him even more'. I feel like that's the scenario Costa should have gone down.\n\n\"I get the impression from Conte that if Costa's around [the club] and he's in [Conte's] face, that's going to be a problem and that's what Costa should be doing.

The first is straightforward, that he should return to the club. The second is that he should report for training, the third that he get match fit and the fourth, and most surprising, that he put himself into contention for first-team selection.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been in dispute with Chelsea's coach, Antonio Conte, since the turn of the year when the Brazilian-born Spain international was upbraided for a row with the fitness coach Julio Tous. After a disappointing second half to last season, Conte told the player he was surplus to requirements by text message, the contents of which Costa then made public.\n\nCosta is believed to have been absent without leave from Chelsea since the club flew to China for a pre-season tour in the middle of July. The club have refused to discuss the nature of any disciplinary proceedings against the player, but Costa claimed in his interview with the Daily Mail that he has had his wages docked since that time.\n\nThe ensuing stand off led to Chelsea's most prized forward watching his club's opening defeat by Burnley on his parent's TV in the Brazilian city of Lagarto. Chelsea's intervention in the dispute has at least set out the club's stall but it looks unlikely to defuse the situation, at least in the short term. Costa now knows the conditions through which he can make peace with the club. But while there are precedents for such disputes ending with the player returning to the field, as Carlos Tevez did for Manchester City after absconding to Argentina in 2010, such an outcome would seem unlikely.\n\nPerhaps the best Costa can hope for is to engender some goodwill, helping him work towards his preferred resolution: a return to his former club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Atl\u00e9tico, however, have yet to meet Chelsea's valuation for the player. They remain an interested party watching on as a struggle for power between player and employee continues.\n\nCosta signed for Chelsea from Atl\u00e9tico in the summer of 2014 for \u00a332m. He won the league with the club in his first season scoring 21 goals in the process. He managed only 16 goals the following season (and 11 yellow cards) as Chelsea suffered a remarkable collapse. The appointment of Conte appeared to galvanise the forward once again with Costa scoring 15 goals before Christmas.

Perhaps it's the one where he manages to get Gabriel Paulista sent off for a retaliatory kick just by standing quite near him muttering and smiling like some horrible, handsome, impossibly terrible footballing Iago.\n\nOr the 2-2 draw with Tottenham where Mark Clattenburg books 12 players but not actually Costa, who has a hand in at least five of those yellows, all the while maintaining an attitude of prim and saintly innocence. Or the 3-1 defeat of Arsenal where Costa \"scare-assists\" his team's final goal by running towards Petr Cech and making Arsenal's goalkeeper perform his best impression of Shaggy from Scooby Doo confronted by a double-dealing fairground owner in a zombie mask.\n\nNow we have this, the endless summer of Diego. As of this week Costa has spent half the summer and the opening week of the Premier League season holed up in his family home in Lagardo pretending to be inconsolably offended by a text message, all the while painting his current employers as bounders, cads, insufficiently \"respectful\" and so on. And in the process raising some genuinely profound issues about transfer fees and freedom of movement that have troubled even the biggest clubs for some time.\n\nIt is now 22 years since the Bosman decision in the European Court of Justice. Its effects are still working their way through football. What is certain is that the game has been transformed around it. And that clubs, governing bodies and players' representatives all know we're not quite done with a process that might just have taken a step forward this summer.\n\nBut back to Diego. Let's face it, given the raw human material involved there was always a chance Costa's time at Chelsea would end in a mess. Footballers are often described as being up for the fight. Costa isn't just up for it. He is the fight, a man whose entire concept of sport is based on a no-holds barred test of all human capacities, including the mental resilience to rise above the goadings of a sharp-elbowed striker with an infuriating line in wounded innocence.\n\nCosta has been a stellar Premier League player through two league titles, 57 goals and almost 400 fouls. It has been wonderful theatre at times. But at the end of this only the hardest heart could fail to raise a smirk of schadenfreude at the sight of Chelsea's chief weapon of footballing chaos turning his guns on his own employer.\n\nThe situation is unlikely to have been eased by Costa's comments in a fascinating interview in the Daily Mail. Relaxing on full pay at his family home, Costa suggested Chelsea are \"treating him like a criminal\". Like Ariel, the harmless sprite of the forest, all he craves is to be \"set free\" - agents, contracts, and sole approved destination pending.\n\nLike a drunken row on a bus, it can take a while to understand exactly what everyone's arguing about. A quick recap on how we got here. In January Costa was dropped briefly after some unrest behind the scenes and reports of a huge offer from China. Chelsea let it be known they had no intention of selling. Later that month Tianjin Quanjian said plans to sign Costa had been scuppered by new Chinese Super League rules. Costa suggested he had no intention of moving to China anyway.\n\nNobody really knows the exact ins and out of this mid-season shemozzle. All that is certain is Costa has been linked with a move away throughout his time at Chelsea; that his form dropped off a cliff after that; and that Antonio Conte sent Costa a text message in early June that apparently read: \"Hi Diego, I hope you are well. Thanks for the season we spent together. Good luck for next year but you are not in my plan.\"\n\nCosta immediately leaked this to Spanish TV. His brother Jair announced that Costa was all set on moving on and had had \"lots of offers\". Since when he has been at home in Lagardo, refusing to train at Chelsea, yawning off his club fines and now smiling, a little sadly, at his team's understandable state of confusion on the opening day of the Premier League season.\n\nAt the end which three things seem clear. First the offending text message looks quite polite, all things considered. Certainly it's more conciliatory than the text Costa might have received in similar circumstances from, say, Brian Clough, or Stan Cullis. Footballing mores dictate that players simply don't behave like this.\n\n\"In January, things happened with the coach,\" he has said. \"I was on the brink of renewing my contract and they put the brakes on it. I suspect the manager was behind it.\" Well, yes Diego. This is how football works. You don't get to upset the coach mid-season and still have him warmly support your offer of a new contract.\n\nFrom a purely footballing view he has no real gripe. Players are shifted on all the time, and hear about it in far less courteous fashion. Costa has already been replaced, and replaced well, by \u00c1lvaro Morata. The path from here is well trodden. Get fit. Find a new club. And stop bleating on about respect.\n\nAt which point things get complicated. \"Why won't they let me go if they don't want me?\" Costa has asked. \"I want to go to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.\"\n\nThe most obvious answer to which, not stated but implied, is that Chelsea are either refusing to sell, given the knock down price Costa would fetch right now; or asking a price Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are unwilling to pay.\n\n\"I have rejected other offers,\" Costa goes on. \"They want to sell me to China or other teams. The language is better for me in Spain. If I'm off, I'm going to the club I want to go to, not the club that's paying the most.\"\n\nAt which point, if you listen closely, you can hear the entire superheated industry of professional club football starting to quiver. Costa's lawyer has already suggested he will use \"all legal mechanisms\" to get the move he wants. How would this work in practice? In the real non-footballing world it seems laughable you could be denied the right to leave your job and work for another employer, or told only certain selected future employers are acceptable.\n\nFootball has come a long way since the retain and transfer system, whereby a player's registration was owned by his club, who could in extremis refuse to release it and force an ex-employee into retirement. The Eastham judgment in 1963 relaxed this owner-and-chattel relationship. Bosman attacked clubs' rights to have a say on a player's employment beyond the end of his contract. Other rulings have already suggested there is headway to be made challenging further the power of clubs to \"own\" a player's employment prospects.\n\nCosta aside, this is a huge live issue given the number of top footballers currently out with a bad case of wanting to play for someone else. Philippe Coutinho wants to work for Barcelona. Virgil van Dijk wanted to work for Liverpool. Both have broken the code by taking steps to decide their own professional destiny.\n\nFootball will remain a special case. Clubs must be protected. Academies and player production systems must be presented with an incentive to produce footballers and stop the whole ramshackle circus from falling to pieces. But for all his infuriating sense of entitlement, his clod-hopping failed powerplay, Costa is undoubtedly on to something.\n\nThree things are possible from here. Conte leaves before Costa does and the most improbable of Premier League comebacks becomes a very, very distant possibility. Chelsea and Atl\u00e9tico reach an agreement that makes this whole sorry mess disappear. Or, at a long shot, the man known during his Albacete days as \"that fucking Brazilian\" gets to wreak his own peculiar havoc on football's transfer system at a time when, quite frankly, anything seems possible out there.", "id": "9116298", "details": {"liCnt": 5}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Despite this clod-hopping powerplay, Diego Costa may be on to something | Barney Ronay", "image":

Morata scored and assisted on his full debut and Le Saux feels that his former club's new \u00a368 million hitman will be a perfect replacement for Costa.\n\n\"When I look at his quality, he has had fantastic experiences at the clubs that he has been at,\" he told Goal. \"He has always scored goals, his movement is excellent. He does a lot of hard work before the ball comes to him. He is always aware of what's around him.\n\n\"The timing of his run for that Willian cross [against Burnley] was great and how he kept himself onside. He got a run on the defender and it was a confident header. He has plenty of ability and attributes.\n\n\"It will have done him a world of good to get off to such a fantastic start but as for him replacing Diego Costa, it is a big task. Costa scored 20 goals last season and 20 goals three seasons ago when Chelsea won the title then as well.\n\n\"Costa is a very adaptive player who is versatile and holds the ball up well. It is a real shame to see what's happening there because he is a really good player. It is a disappointing situation to see it get to where it has.\n\n\"I think over time, Morata, if he continues to do what he did, will settle in and lead the line very well.\"\n\nMorata came off the bench to make his debut against Burnely, and his impressive cameo may earn him his first start in the London derby at Wembley against Tottenham in place of the underwhelming Michy Batshuayi.\n\nHowever, despite not being with the team, Costa has stolen the headlines this week after conducting an unsanctioned interview in his native Brazil. Costa has been ordered back to training so Chelsea can maintain his fitness and value but he has so far remained in the country of his birth.\n\nLe Saux made 192 appearances for Chelsea and thinks that these situations aren't uncommon. He also believes Chelsea's players can put Costa's situation out of their minds and aim for three points on Sunday.\n\n\"I think it goes all the way back to last Christmas when he tried to leave then,\" Le Saux added. \"I thought that the club, manager and players handled that situation really well because they managed to not let it detract from what they were doing in the league and not affect anyone.\n\n\"Costa deserves credit for that as well but now, it strikes me that [Antonio] Conte can't wait to cut him loose. I think when you are in that environment, you need to know everybody is committed to that same cause. As soon as you find out someone isn't you lose trust and faith in them.\"\n\nChelsea will have a youthful bench against Tottenham, just as they did against Burnley and Arsenal in the Community Shield, with the likes of Kyle Scott, Charly Musonda and Jeremie Boga having been promoted to the first team as injuries and suspensions hit the squad.\n\nConte has also hinted at wanting more signings before transfer deadline day and Le Saux, who was once English football's most expensive defender, agrees that his former club need more.\n\n\"What I felt, even toward the end of last season is that Chelsea might strengthen their wing-back positions,\" he added. \"That's not because Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso aren't first choice or good enough but I think it is such a demanding and specialist position that it is Chelsea's one area that they needed to strengthen.\n\n\"They needed a replacement for Costa and have that. They have Rudiger and the injured Bakayoko as well so another couple of players and getting the injured players back on the bench and in the team will make the squad look better. At the moment, it does look a little bit too thin.\n\nArsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Everton's Ross Barkley and Leicester City's Danny Drinkwater are among the talents that Chelsea are targeting with the transfer window due to close in a fortnight.\n\nChelsea appear to be looking to English talent, with a squad lacking in homegrown players, and Le Saux hopes that England's national team can benefit from seeing one of their players arriving at Stamford Bridge.\n\n\"I think first of all, the club looks for the type of player and they worry about the nationality second. At the same time, I think to see any England players at top-eight or top-six clubs is a good thing. It really is because I want English players at every level of our game in large clubs.\n\n\"English players at top-eight clubs are getting fantastic experience with their team-mates, learning a lot as well and learning those demands of the highest level of football.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nGraeme Le Saux was speaking on behalf of TAG Heuer to promote the TAG Heuer Premier League Pressure Test.

unlikely Costa would heed their demand.\n\nA source close to the Spanish international said: \"I really don't think he is in the right state of mind.\"\n\nAnd Starsport can reveal the champions have not given up on landing Torino ace Belotti.\n\nThe Blues have already bought Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid for \u00a370m.\n\nThe favourites to sign for Chelsea before the transfer window closes

Batshuayi\n\nAnd with Costa set to stay away with his family in Brazil, Conte feels the club need to boost their strikeforce.\n\nBelotti, 23, banged in 26 goals in 35 Serie A games last season and the champions have been constantly linked with the Italy international all summer.\n\nHe has earned comparisons to Chelsea legend Gianluca Vialli for his athleticism and powerful style of play, but Torino have been holding out for \u00a380m for the prized asset.\n\nAnd with Chelsea starting the season so poorly - losing 3-2 at home to Burnley on Saturday - a deal could still be struck.\n\nConte wants a number of reinforcements in this window, with Southampton centre back Virgil van Dijk, Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Danny Drinkwater of Leicester key targets.\n\nChelsea are also keen on Paris St-Germain right-back Serge Aurier, who is available for \u00a327m, but Tottenham have now joined Manchester United in the hunt.\n\nDespite demanding Costa, who has insisted he only wants to play for Atletico Madrid, returns to training Chelsea are prepared for a stalemate with the Spain striker.\n\nCarlos Tevez spent three months away in Argentina on unauthorised leave from Manchester City back in 2011 and the club continued to fine him for his absence.\n\nChelsea are understood to plan the same tactic with Costa, fining him his wages for two weeks - \u00a3280,000 - every fortnight.\n\nMeanwhile, Eden Hazard returned to full training yesterday having missed most of pre-season with a broken ankle.\n\nHe was joined by new midfield signing Tiemoue Bakayoko, who is back

How does Antonio Conte keep the grenades being lobbed in by his exiled star striker from blowing apart dressing-room morale?\n\nIt will be some achievement if the champions can respond to yet another week of controversy, suspensions and in-fighting by beating Spurs, the best-balanced team in the Premier League.\n\nTo be fair to Chelsea, they are doing their best to declare their war with Costa over.\n\nConte will dismiss it publicly yet again in his pre-match press conference on Friday and claim to be more focused on the weekend's trip to Wembley to face Tottenham.\n\nTrouble is, for Costa the war goes on.\n\nFor him, it is his way - an instant move to Atletico Madrid -- or the highway.\n\nSo when he does finally leave Brazil within the next few days it will be for Spain, not London.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now\n\nChelsea's demand this week, for him to return to their Cobham HQ, get fit and make himself available for selection has carried about as much authority as a Donald Trump speech.\n\nWorse still for Conte, there are players in the dressing room unhappy that the man who shot them to two titles in the last three season remains out in the cold. It wouldn't take a great leap to count the Blues' Spanish contingent as being among that number.\n\nIt is a continuing crisis for a man knee-deep in it this summer:\n\n* Costa has no compunction about keeping up the fight against the club and, in particular, Conte.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now\n\n* The Italian is at odds with the Chelsea board over transfer policy, who were not best pleased that he jumped the gun with THAT text to Costa.\n\n* The players are concerned the squad is still too thin to compete on four fronts.\n\n* And the fans can see that, once again, the club are in danger of shooting themselves in the foot after working so hard to make themselves champions.\n\nThe biggest fear is that the man who did so well to win so many people over in his debut campaign last season, could walk away .\n\nChelsea won't change -- with some justification.\n\nThe set-up under Roman Abramovich has taken the club to the top of the Premier League and into European football's elite. Why should they invest in older players with no re-sale value to make Conte look good over the next couple of years, instead of investing in the quality that will keep them at the top for the long term?\n\nThat said, Conte is also right in pointing to the fact that, with the investment at both Manchester clubs in particular, Chelsea may well have dragged their heels by leaving their summer business so late.\n\nIn fairness to both parties, the club were eighth, eight points off City when they were trounced 3-0 at Arsenal last September.\n\nThe pundits wrote them off for the title, the bookies wrote them off for even the top four and even Conte feared the worst with Pep Guardiola's men at the time rampant.\n\nWe now know that they were early days.\n\nConte didn't expect to have to perform miracles, however, for a second season in a row.\n\npoll loading Will Chelsea retain their Premier League title?

We have banter over WhatsApp. They ask how I am. They really love me for the person I am. If they didn't, they wouldn't be saying they miss me and love me.\n\n\"Jose [Mourinho] has called me, direct to my phone, just to check I am OK and to see how I am. He wished me good luck.

Yet 24 hours later the Spain international was giving chapter and verse to the Daily Mail.\n\nIt would not have had the same impact if the Blues had beaten Burnley. But now comparisons with the dreadful start to the 2015-16 campaign, when they went on to finish 10th and sacked former manager Jose Mourinho before Christmas, will only increase.\n\nJust as Conte has moaned about the club's dealings in the transfer market over the past few weeks after leading the team to the title, Mourinho was unhappy about their business in the summer window two years ago, having just guided them to the Premier League trophy himself.\n\nMourinho also fell out with Costa back then, although the striker has continued to deny it, and it had a negative impact on the pitch. However, at least he was in the capital, rather than thousands of miles away in Brazil as he is now.\n\nThe 2015 campaign began with Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois getting sent off and the team dropping two points at home against unfancied opposition, although at least they scrambled a 2-2 draw with Swansea.\n\nConte's side managed to usurp the seriousness of that setback by having a couple of players shown the red card against Burnley and losing the game altogether.\n\nWith a depleted squad taking on Tottenham this Sunday, sources of optimism are few and far between.\n\nStill, at least they showed character in the final half-hour against Sean Dyche's side, coming back from three goals down and almost getting a draw with nine men.\n\nClub record buy Alvaro Morata's official debut off the bench was very encouraging, while Chelsea are still confident there will be four more arrivals before the end of the month. Vice-captain Cesar Azpilicueta has also offered cause for hope, namely that several members of the current dressing room were at Chelsea during the misery of 2015-16.\n\nThe Spain defender sees that as a help rather than a hindrance in their attempts to make sure history does not repeat itself.\n\nHe explained to Standard Sport: \"The players that were here two years ago know how difficult that season was, so with the experience we have of that, we have to learn from it and to change it.\n\n\"We know that a lot of teams have suffered after being champions. Not a lot of teams have won the League two years in a row in recent years. It is very difficult, so this is a big challenge for us.\n\n\"We know that everyone is going to try harder to beat us because we are the champions and were the best last season. It is something we have to take, and hopefully with our great experience of that from before, we can deal with it and turn things around.\"\n\nOne would think an away game against Spurs, their fiercest London rivals and a contender for the championship, would be the last thing the players would want now.\n\nBut Azpilicueta believes it provides the perfect remedy, adding: \"We know what a game against Tottenham means for all of us and the fans.\n\n\"It is a great moment when you come from a defeat to go there. We know that every game against them is a big game. It's a good match for us to turn back to winning ways. We know it is a difficult team, but I have no doubts we will work really hard to get into the best shape possible for Sunday. The best way to respond is to work hard this week at Cobham, to go to Wembley to play a good game and get the three points.\"\n\nAnother loss, however, would only increase talk of a crisis and Conte's future at Chelsea being in doubt.", "id": "9069679", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Rebel Costa heaps more misery on Chelsea after nightmare start", "image":

summer and has no chance of resolving his future with the club after claiming he's been treated like a 'criminal'.\n\nSteven Gerrard tips Liverpool youngster to become 'top, top' player at Anfield\n\nAlvaro Morata completed a \u00a370million club record move to west London in July and many people felt he would be a direct replacement for Costa.\n\nHowever, Conte remains unconvinced by Michy Batshuayi and wants to add more firepower to his squad in the form of Belotti, according to the Daily Star.\n\nBelotti, 23, scored 26 goals in Serie A last season and Chelsea are aware of the Italian's \u00a387.5m release clause.\n\nThough the Blues would rather negotiate a deal for Belotti, they know they can leave a move for the striker late into the window and can move for him once Costa departs.\n\nArsenal cleared to sign \u00a340m winger after major development\n\nAtletico Madrid remain the most likely destination for Costa but he will have to wait until January before he can move to the Spanish capital because of their transfer ban.\n\nIn any case, Conte wants him gone before adding to his squad and he wants four further signings this summer in central defence, full-back, central midfield and up front.\n\nMORE: Paul Pogba ready to become Manchester United's main man after Neymar takes transfer record tag", "id": "9371504", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title":

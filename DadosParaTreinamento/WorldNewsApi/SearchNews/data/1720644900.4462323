{"id": 231440460, "title": "Tour of Britain Women: Wiebes takes stage three as Kopecky holds lead", "text": "SD Worx-Protime\u2019s dominance of the Tour of Britain Women continued on stage three as Lorena Wiebes won the sprint for the line in Warrington. It was her team\u2019s third straight victory in the race and it is entirely conceivable they could secure a clean sweep in Sunday\u2019s finale. The general classification leader, Lotte Kopecky, illustrated her team\u2019s iron-fisted grip on the four-stage race by setting up her SD Worx-Protime colleague Wiebes for the win. The Belgian, who maintained her 17-second lead over Britain\u2019s Anna Henderson going into Sunday\u2019s final stage, guided Wiebes to within 200m of the finish line. Dutch sprinter Wiebes then powered away to outlast Charlotte Kool (DSM-Firmenich PostNL), as Georgia Baker (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) finished third. It will take a decisive move from one of her rivals during stage four to get Kopecky out of the leader\u2019s green jersey, with bonus seconds on the line not enough to change the general classification standings alone. Given SD Worx-Protime had three riders in the top 15 places on stage three, that kind of turnaround seems unlikely. \u201cThe team did a really good job all day controlling the breakaway,\u201d stage winner Wiebes said afterwards. \u201cWe kept Christine [Majerus], Lotte, Barbara [Guarischi] and me together for the final. Christine delivered us really well through the corner and it was a really fast finish. \u201cI was there with 200 metres to go and started my sprint. I\u2019m so happy to deliver for my team,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice when the girls have done so much work to finish it off. One more to day to go, so we go again full for it.\u201d Kopecky, the reigning world champion, said: \u201cDefending the GC [is the biggest priority for the final stage], we are 17 seconds ahead so with the bonus [seconds alone] it\u2019s not possible to be beaten anymore, so we will have to be attentive and see who can go out.\u201d Saturday\u2019s narrative was largely written by a two-rider breakaway of British riders Jo Tindley (Pro-Noctis-200\u00b0 Coffee-Hargreaves Contracting) and Maddie Leech (Lifeplus-Wahoo), who attacked with 102km to go and built a gap of four minutes. Leech suffered mechanical problems and had to drop back after the second Queen of the Mountains checkpoint. Tindley was able to continue solo, but she was eventually caught about 12km from the line. There was a a late attack by Valerie Demey, but she also suffered a mechanical issue, allowing the sprint trains to take over on the run into Warrington. Henderson (Great Britain) leads third-placed Letizia Paternoster (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) by 15 seconds. In the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9, Primoz Roglic and his Bora-Hansgrohe team closed in on overall victory as the Slovenian won stage seven and extended his lead over Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike) in the general classification standings to 1min 2secs. Roglic attacked with around 250m to go to the summit at Samo\u00ebns 1600 to finish narrowly ahead of Jorgenson and Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek). Soudal Quick-Step\u2019s Remco Evenepoel, who started the stage second overall, slipped off the podium after being dropped in the mountains for the second consecutive day, losing more than a minute to Roglic. Evenepoel\u2019s demise means Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) moves up to third overall, and Evenepoel down in sixth.", "summary": "<ul><li>SD Worx-Protime claim third stage win in a row</li><li>Primoz Roglic looks set for overall Dauphin\u00e9 victory</li></ul><p>SD Worx-Protime\u2019s dominance of the Tour of Britain Women continued on stage three as Lorena Wiebes won the sprint for the line in Warrington.

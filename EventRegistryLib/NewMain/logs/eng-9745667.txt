the Iranian-backed Houthi militia that killed one man and slightly wounding four others, the Israeli military and emergency services say.\n\nThe explosion early on Friday, which did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military confirmed it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.\n\n\"We're talking about a large UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) that can fly large distances,\" an Israeli military official told journalists after the strike.\n\nThe official did not confirm the claim from the Yemen-based Houthi militia but said: \"We're not ruling out any possibilities right now.\"\n\nThe attack on Tel Aviv is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war, as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\nThe Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the drone was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.\n\nThe military said air patrols had been increased to protect Israeli airspace but it had not ordered new civil defence measures.\n\nHowever, the mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.\n\nA spokesman for Yemen's Houthi militants, which like Hezbollah are backed by Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.\n\nIn a televised speech, spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target \"within the range of our weapons\".\n\nHe said the strike was carried out using a new drone called \"Yafa\", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.\n\n\"The operation has achieved its goals successfully,\" Saree said.\n\nIsrael's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and said the circumstances were being investigated.\n\nFour people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries and four others were treated for shock.\n\nAll of them were later released, the hospital said.\n\nFootage from the site showed an apparent impact on a building located close to U.S. embassy premises in Tel Aviv.\n\nIsraeli media said fragments from a drone of a kind widely used by Iranian-backed militia groups had been recovered nearby.\n\nIsrael has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.\n\nThe Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael invaded the Gaza Strip following an attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel in October 2023.\n\nGet the latest news

From evidence found at the scene, it would appear that the aircraft is an Iranian Samad-3 drone,' he said.\n\nYemen's Houthi group earlier today claimed responsibility for the attack that caused the explosion.\n\nA spokesperson for the Houthi armed forces said in a post on social media Friday that the Iran-aligned group had 'targeted Tel Aviv in occupied Palestine'.\n\nIt claimed that it had used a new drone 'capable of bypassing interceptor systems and being able to be detected by radars'.\n\nIt's armed wing also released a statement celebrating the attack, saying: 'Triumphing for the oppression of the Palestinian people and their mujahideen, and in retaliation to the Zionist enemy's massacres against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip'.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had now opened an investigation into the large, and fatal, explosion near the US embassy office and would work out why the country's air defence systems were not activated to intercept the 'aerial target' before any damage was caused.\n\nYemen's Iran-backed Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had 'targeted Tel Aviv in occupied Palestine'\n\nA Tel Aviv man stands next to a damaged car near the site of the deadly blast, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv\n\nFollowing the drone strike, Israel's air force took to social media claiming it had increased patrols to 'protect the country's skies'.\n\nIsraeli police said the body of a 50-year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion site, and that the circumstances surrounding his death were also being investigated.\n\nRead More Israel accuses Hamas of trying to 'hide' the results of its airstrike which killed 'at least 90'\n\nFour people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries and four others were treated for shock.

It was only when I went outside that I realised that several buildings had been damaged.'\n\nThe incident came after the Israeli military confirmed it had killed a senior commander of the Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon on July 3.\n\nA Hezbollah statement at the time identified the killed commander as Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who went by the name Abu Naameh.\n\nA Hezbollah official speaking anonymously said he was head of the group's Aziz Unit, one of three regional divisions in southern Lebanon.\n\nBoth Hezbollah and the Houthis have stepped up their attacks against Israel, saying they

The official did not confirm the claim from the Yemen-based Houthi militia but said: \"We're not ruling out any possibilities right now.\"\n\nThe attack on Tel Aviv is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war, as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\nThe Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the drone was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.\n\nThe military said air patrols had been increased to protect Israeli airspace but said it had not ordered new civil defence measures, however the mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.\n\nA spokesman for Yemen's Houthi militants, which like Hezbollah are backed by Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.\n\nIn a televised speech, spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target \"within the range of our weapons\".\n\nHe said the strike was carried out using a new drone called \"Yafa\", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars. \"The operation has achieved its goals successfully,\" Saree said.\n\nIsrael's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and said the circumstances were being investigated.\n\nFour people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries and four others were treated for shock. All of them were later released, the hospital said.\n\nFootage from the site showed an apparent impact on a building located close to U.S. embassy premises in Tel Aviv.\n\nIsraeli media said fragments from an drone of a kind widely used by Iranian-backed militia groups in the region had been recovered nearby.\n\nIsrael has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.\n\nThe Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael invaded the Gaza Strip following an attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel in October last year.\n\n(Reporting by James Mackenzie;

Hagari said there were \"increasing signs\" that Mohammed Deif, head of the military wing of Hamas, had been killed in an Israeli airstrike last week.\n\nDeif is believed to be the chief mastermind behind the Hamas-led October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and triggered the Israel-Hamas war. He has been on the top of Israel's most-wanted list for years and is believed to have escaped multiple Israeli assassination attempts in the past.\n\nHamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.\n\n(with inputs from agencies)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Deif", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Deif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaffa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jaffa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(weaponry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fragmentation (weaponry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/israel-1721386946.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2789, "textEnd": 2798, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.\n\nIn the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.\n\n\"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS\"\n\nHouthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target \"within the range of our weapons\".\n\nHe said the strike was carried out using a new drone called \"Yafa\", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.\n\n\"The operation has achieved its goals successfully,\" Saree said in a televised speech.\n\nIsrael's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries. Four others were treated for shock. All of them were later released, health services said.\n\nIsrael has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.\n\nThe Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.\n\nHamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType":

It said air patrols had been stepped up.\n\nAn Israeli military official said a \"very big\" drone was used in an attack on Tel Aviv on Friday that killed one person, and \"human error\" led to the missile not being intercepted.\n\nYemen's Huthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack that caused an explosion at a building near the US embassy in Tel Aviv.\n\nThe military official told a briefing an attack by the Iran-backed Huthis was \"one of the possibilities\" being investigated.\n\nThe official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said \"a very big drone that can travel long distances\" was used in the attack which was at 3.12 am.\n\nHe said the drone \"crashed into an apartment building\" and \"it wasn't a tiny drone\".\n\nThe official said the aim was \"terrorism.\" \"Their main goal was to kill civilians in Israel.\"\n\nThe official said the drone was detected but the alarm was not immediately raised because of \"human error.\"\n\n\"There was no alert that sounded in Tel Aviv because it wasn't activated.\n\n\"There was a human error that caused the interception and defence systems not to be operated,\" the official said.\n\n\"Obviously, one of the possibilities we're looking into is Yemen because of the Huthi announcements. But we're not ruling out anything.\"\n\nThe official said another drone was detected on Israel's eastern border.\n\n\"Last night, there was another incident where we thwarted a UAV on our eastern border, another UAV.\" He gave no details on where it came from.\n\nThe Huthis, who have carried out dozens of attacks against Red Sea shipping to show support for Palestinians during the Gaza war, said their \"UAV force\" attacked \"one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv.\"\n\nThe rebels last Saturday had said they would \"not hesitate to expand its military operations... until the aggression stops.\"\n\nIf an attack is confirmed, it would be the first to cause casualties in Tel Aviv since a rocket strike launched from Gaza wounded one person on May 26. Hundreds of rockets were fired at Tel Aviv in the Oct. 7 attacks that set off the war, but most were intercepted.\n\nIsraeli police said they received hundreds of reports around 3:00 am of \"a strong explosion.\"\n\nThe blast hit a building in a street near an annex of the US embassy in Israel, according to an AFP journalist, who saw broken windows.\n\nDuring the search, a man in his fifties was \"found dead in his apartment\" bearing injuries caused by shrapnel, police said.\n\nIn Beirut, Israeli strikes on Thursday killed at least five people, including the commander of a Hamas-allied group in Lebanon, militant groups and a security source said.\n\nSince Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on Israel sparked war in Gaza, Israel has repeatedly targeted militants of Jamaa Islamiya, whose armed wing has launched attacks on Israel from southern Lebanon over the past nine months.\n\nA Lebanese security source said that an Israeli strike on a house near the southern village of Jmaijmeh killed three people and wounded several more.\n\nHezbollah said two of its members were among the dead, including Ali Jaafar Maatouq. A source close to the Islamist group described him as a commander of its elite Al Radwan operational unit.\n\nThe Israeli army confirmed that its air force had \"eliminated\" Ali Jaafar Maatouq in a strike against \"a command centre where Hezbollah terrorists were operating in the Jmaijmeh region.\"\n\nThe Magen David Adom emergency medical service said in a statement that it treated a man and a woman injured in their home, and two others hurt in the street. All four were taken to hospital with \"relatively minor\" injuries, it said.\n\n\"It may have been an aerial explosion... We were very lucky,\" said Peretz Amar, the Tel Aviv police commander, adding that \"the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nA Tel Aviv resident told AFP that he was awakened by the explosion and \"everything shook\".\n\nPolice called on residents to \"respect safety instructions and not to approach or touch debris or shrapnel that may contain explosives.\"\n\nThe fire brigade said it was possible that a drone had caused the explosion.\n\nThe war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's military retaliation has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry.", "source": {"uri": "manilastandard.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila

The incident is under thorough review,\" the military said in a statement.\n\nThe attack on Tel Aviv is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war, as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\nIt said air patrols had been increased to protect Israeli airspace but said it had not ordered new civil defence measures, however the mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.\n\nA spokesman for Yemen's Houthi militants, which like Hezbollah are backed by Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.\n\nIn a televised speech, spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target \"within the range of our weapons\".\n\nIsrael's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and said the circumstances were being investigated.\n\nFour people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries and four others were treated for shock. All of them were later released, the hospital said.\n\nFootage from the site showed an apparent impact on a building located close to U.S. embassy premises in Tel Aviv. Broken glass could be seen strewn across the city pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered nearby. The site was sealed off by police tape.\n\nIsraeli media said fragments from an drone of a kind widely used by Iranian-backed militia groups in the region had been recovered nearby.\n\nIsrael has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.\n\nThe Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael invaded the Gaza Strip following an attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel in October last year.

The Houthis controls large parts of Yemen and have been firing drones at Israel's southern territory for months, as well as attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea.\n\nThey support Palestinians in Gaza: But what do Yemen's Houthi rebels really want?\n\nThe IDF said it was probing why \"no sirens were activated\" and that it has increased air patrols over Israeli airspace.\n\nU.S. Central Command said in a statement late Thursday that its forces destroyed two surface-to-air missiles and four drones on the ground in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen over the last 24 hours.\n\nTel Aviv's Mayor Ron Huldai said the city is moving to a higher state of alert after the apparent drone attack. \"The war is still here, and it is hard and painful,\" he said in a post on X, the social media platform.\n\nU.S.-built $230 million pier in Gaza: It's shutting down after two months of troubles\n\nIsrael has kept up its airstrikes in Gaza as the war there approaches its tenth month. Talks between Israel and Hamas over a cease-fire that would free hostages held by Hamas have stalled.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem when he was in office, a controversial decision because Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. The explosion near the Tel Aviv branch office was in a central district that is home to a number of diplomatic missions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Yemen's Houthis claim drone attack on Tel Aviv", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_strikes_in_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drone strikes in Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magen David Adom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Huldai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron Huldai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surface-to-air missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic mission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_NL0sOpGsSb9AlXxDvl1oA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_news_641/0851f5959fa03bf02d5cfccc63b281ef", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Israeli officials said later Friday morning that the blast was caused by a drone fired from Yemen, and that one man in his 50s was killed by shrapnel that tore into his home and at least eight other people were wounded.\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthi movement, which has been fighting Yemen's internationally recognized government in a decade-long civil war, claimed responsibility for the explosion, saying in social media messages that it marked a \"new phase\" in its operations against Israel in response to the Israelis' ongoing war against the Houthis' ideological ally Hamas.\n\nThe Houthis said the strike used a \"new drone called 'Yafa', which is capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems,\" without providing any further detail. The explosion caused by the drone was very near the U.S. consulate in Tel Aviv, but it remained unclear whether that was the target. There were no U.S. casualties reported.\n\nIsraeli authorities said the explosion hit an apartment building in Tel Aviv at 3:12 a.m. (7:12 p.m. Eastern on Thursday).\n\nIn a statement, Israel Defense Forces chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the drone \"hit a building in central Tel Aviv where a civilian was killed and eight were slightly injured.\" He confirmed that \"no alert was triggered\" and said the military was investigating how the weapon had slipped through Israel's advanced air defenses.\n\nHagari said a preliminary investigation showed the drone \"was fired from Yemen and it is an Iranian weapon that has been upgraded to extend the range.\"\n\n\"Iran supports and arms its affiliates. So far, dozens of drones have been launched from Yemen, most of which were intercepted or shot down by CENTCOM [U.S. military] or Israel's defense systems,\" Hagari said, adding that another drone was shot down outside the Israel's borders early Friday as it approached from the east, and that the military was \"checking the connection between the two events.\"\n\nBased on verified social media videos, CBS News confirmed the blast occurred a little more than 200 yards from the U.S. consulate in Tel Aviv. A U.S. official told CBS News that no American casualties had been reported.\n\nThe Houthis have launched drones and missiles at Israel and at commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea and surrounding waters throughout the nine-month war, in solidarity with Hamas. But until Friday, all the weapons fired at Israel had been intercepted by either Israel or its Western allies.\n\nIsrael has so far not carried out any attacks on the Houthis directly, allowing its allies the U.S. and Britain to take the lead instead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, which is also backed by Iran.\n\nIn a statement issued later Friday, Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant vowed to \"bring to justice anyone who harms the State of Israel,\" and said he had held an assessment \"to review the steps required to strengthen our defense arrays in light of events overnight, as well as the intelligence and operational activities required against those responsible for the attack.\"", "source": {"uri":

The incident is under thorough review,\" Israel's military said in a statement.\n\nThe army added that its air force will increase patrols by fighter jets \"to defend Israeli skies\".\n\nIt has not, however, ordered new civil defence measures.\n\nTel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai said in a statement that the city is \"moving to a higher state of alert\" following the attack.\n\n\"The war is still here, and it is difficult and painful,\" he added. \"We are prepared for developments, if there will be any.\"\n\nThe unprecedented attack took place hours after Israel killed two top commanders from the Lebanese Iran-backed group Hezbollah in south Lebanon.\n\nFollowing the strike, which the Houthis say was done in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, the military spokesperson for the Yemeni group said that \"the Yemeni Armed Forces declare the occupied Jaffa [Tel Aviv] region an unsafe area and will be a primary target within the range of our weapons. and will focus on targeting the Zionist enemy's internal front and reaching the depths\".\n\nThe Houthis were already engaged in months-long targeting of ships in the Red Sea they claim were linked to Israel, with June seeing their largest

At the moment we don't know what the object was,\" Mr Amar said.\n\nIsrael's military said they were reviewing the explosion and increasing air patrols after the incident which Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai on X, formerly Twitter, called a drone strike.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the strike evaded Israel's air defences or how Israel might respond, but the strike did hit hours after Israel's military confirmed an airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement on X that the strike was made in retaliation to the war in Gaza and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed that their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defence systems. However, a spokesperson for Israel's military said on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error\".\n\nThe military's assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such strikes for months.\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted to kill civilians in Israel,\" the Israeli spokesperson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYemen's Houthis have repeatedly launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the nine-month-long war in sympathy with Hamas.\n\nUntil Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nThe country has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe attack on Tel Aviv comes as international mediators continue to hold out hope for a ceasefire agreement, pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's arch enemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war.\n\nIran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' October 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry.\n\nThe war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nHezbollah said it fired a volley of rockets on a northern Israeli village on Friday morning in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes the night before on south Lebanon that killed several Hezbollah members and wounded civilians.\n\nIn another attack, the group also said that it used for the first time a new rocket with heavy warhead to strike an Israeli army post in the disputed Kfar Chouba hills.\n\nHezbollah said in a statement that the Wabel rocket, produced by the group in Lebanon, destroyed parts of the Rweisat al-Alam post and caused a fire inside it.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters fired a salvo of rockets on the northern Israeli village of Abirim for the first time since fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border began in early October.", "source": {"uri": "thejournal.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheJournal.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Authorities confirmed that the explosion had been caused by \"an aerial target.\"\n\nThe blast left at least one person dead, an Israeli emergency services spokesperson said. A police report had said seven people were lightly injured.\n\n\"No sirens were activated,\" the army said in a statement, adding that the air force had \"increased its air patrols in order to protect Israeli airspace\".\n\nThe blast occurred about 100 meters from the compound of the US Embassy branch office, according to a CNN analysis of open-source satellite imagery of the scene. It was not immediately clear whether the drone was targeting the American mission.\n\nYemen's Houthis' military spokesperson said the group attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and will continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war. Yemen is approximately 2,300 kilometers from Israel.\n\n\"The Yemeni Armed Forces Air Force, with the help of God Almighty, carried out a qualitative military operation, which consisted of targeting one of the important targets in the occupied Yafa region, known as Tel Aviv,\" said the spokesperson.\n\n\"The operation was carried out with a new drone called Yafa, which is capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems and being unable to be detected by radars. The operation achieved its goals successfully.\"\n\nTel Aviv's mayor, Ron Huldai, posted on X that the city was on \"high alert\" after the drone attack and that residents were required to follow emergency instructions. \"The war is still here, and it is hard and painful,\" he said.\n\nThe attack came after a series of Israeli strikes destroyed a three-storey building in southern Lebanon on Thursday night and killed a commander in Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces.\n\nHezbollah and Houthis are part of the Iran-backed network of militant groups in the Middle East, and have been both attacking Israeli targets since the war in Gaza broke out on October 7.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Houthis claim responsibility", "body": "TEL AVIV, Israel -- A drone slammed into an apartment building near the Tel Aviv oceanfront before dawn Friday, killing one man and wounding at least 10 more civilians. The Houthi militia in Yemen said it carried out the attack, marking the first time the group has penetrated a major Israeli city.\n\nThe drone set off a loud blast that woke Tel Aviv residents just after 3 a.m. The weapon struck an apartment building a block in from the Mediterranean seafront, spraying shrapnel at the point of impact and shattering glass in surrounding buildings.\n\nJonathan Karten, 27, said he and a couple of friends had been out on the balcony just beforehand.\n\n\"A friend of mine said, 'What's that over there?'\" he said. \"I turned my head to see. And then I heard a buzzing. It was maybe 30 meters above sea level. And then I saw an orange blast. I felt this heat, a blowback.\"\n\nThe drone hit just a block from the U.S. Embassy Branch Office, which is on the oceanfront. The diplomatic compound previously served as the U.S. Embassy until it was moved to Jerusalem in 2018.\n\nThe Houthis have launched missiles and drones toward southern Israel since war erupted in Gaza last October, to little effect. The group had not previously been linked to a damaging strike on Tel Aviv or any other city.\n\nIsrael's Iron Dome air defense system has largely protected Tel Aviv and other population centers from the thousands of rockets fired by Hamas out of Gaza and by Hezbollah from Lebanon. But this attack apparently caught Israeli forces off-guard.\n\nSirens typically provide a warning when Tel Aviv or other cities come under aerial attack. But an Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said no alert was sounded because the detection system had not been activated. The official described it as \"human error.\" The official described the drone as large and capable of long-distance flight.\n\nGiven the location of the attack, the drone may have approached Israel from the Mediterranean Sea, but Israeli officials did not immediately comment on the route it took.\n\nThe Houthis, the most powerful group in Yemen, claimed responsibility and said this was a new type of drone \"capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems and undetectable by radars. The operation has achieved its goals successfully.\"\n\nThe group warned of more such attacks.\n\nThe Israeli military official said the initial evidence suggested the drone was launched from Yemen, but Israel was investigating a range of possibilities.\n\nThe Houthis have been firing for months on commercial ships in the Red Sea, off Yemen's western coast. The U.S. Navy has been leading the effort against the Houthi attacks. The Houthis say they are acting to show solidarity with the Palestinians over the war in Gaza, though the civilian shipping traffic involves vessels from around the world.\n\nTel Aviv came under heavy rocket fire from Hamas in the early weeks of the war last fall, but the attacks have long since stopped. Hamas occasionally fires rockets into southern Israel.\n\nThe main aerial threat to Israel has been coming from the north, with Hezbollah and Israel trading rocket fire across the border on a daily basis.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_estrin@npr.org", "name": "Daniel Estrin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "greg_myre@npr.org", "name": "Greg Myre", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy_of_the_United_States,_Jerusalem", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Embassy of the United States, Jerusalem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(weaponry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fragmentation (weaponry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iron Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7602x4276+0+472/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2F81%2F0cc19cd0421ea37f9bfb64477aad%2Ftel-aviv-attack-7-19-24-ap24201257370815.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The incident is under thorough review,\" the military said in a statement.\n\nIt said air patrols had been increased to protect Israeli airspace but it had not ordered new civil defence measures.\n\nThe Houthis claimed responsibility, saying their \"UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] force\" attacked \"one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Israeli forces said they detected a suspected Houthi drone heading towards the Red Sea port of Eilat, which they shot down using a fighter jet.\n\nThe Iran-backed group has also launched waves of maritime attacks targeting shipping through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, causing major disruption and a precipitous drop in business at the port of Eilat.\n\nThe Houthis have said they launched the attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza, which have so far killed more than 38,000 people since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nThe drone attack shook residents of Tel Aviv, undermining a fragile sense of security as Israelis in the north close to the border with Lebanon increasingly fear incursions by drones or rockets sent by Hezbollah, while communities close to the border with Gaza remain on high alert for sporadic rocket fire.\n\nFootage from the site in Tel Aviv showed broken glass strewn across the city pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. The site, close to a US embassy annexe in Tel Aviv, was sealed off by police tape.\n\nEmergency services said the explosion took place at about 3.15am local time, striking a building in the centre of the city.\n\n\"The blast apparently occurred at some altitude,\" the Tel Aviv police district commander Peretz Amar told the Israeli outlet Haaretz from the scene. \"We still do not know what it was. Right now we are clearing the area. There was a lucky escape here.\"\n\nPolice found a body bearing injuries caused by shrapnel in the building, which is located on the corner of Ben-Yehuda Avenue and Shalom-Aleichem Street, a spokesperson said.\n\n\"The police, along with emergency and rescue forces, discovered a man in his 50s in a nearby building who was found dead in his apartment with shrapnel wounds on his body,\" a police statement said, adding that two other people were lightly injured.\n\nResidents of central Tel Aviv said they were woken by a loud explosion, while others described suddenly feeling their buildings shake.\n\n\"The whole building shook,\" said a resident named Alon, speaking to Haaretz. \"My neighbours' windows shattered so I was sure something had hit the building. It was only when I went outside that I realised that several buildings had been damaged.\"\n\nA paramedic with the Magen David Adom emergency services described treating injured people in the street and two in their home. \"Shortly afterwards we found the fatality on one of the top floors of an adjacent building. He was in bed and there was shrapnel damage everywhere in his apartment. We had no choice but to pronounce him dead,\" he said.\n\nPolice and bomb disposal units were deployed to the scene and conducted searches for suspicious objects and additional threats. Police urged residents to \"respect safety instructions and not to approach or touch debris or shrapnel that may contain explosives\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ruth_michaelson@theguardian.com", "name": "Ruth Michaelson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Eilat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Port of Eilat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaffa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jaffa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(weaponry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fragmentation (weaponry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Aden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haaretz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Explosive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magen David Adom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_disposal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bomb disposal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/505ed4b21a7cb19f8ebd57b8184da8898a953fe0/0_367_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=d779e635911c2880ff847793595133b5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1431, "textEnd": 1440}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack and Israel's military said it believed the drone -- an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances -- originated in Yemen.\n\n\"We are holding an investigation today and in the coming days to understand exactly from where the threat was fired and what are the needed responses to defend the country and what are the attacking responses against who is threatening the state of Israel,\" said Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for Israel's military.\n\nThe Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the country's war with Hamas. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the Israel-Hamas war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nIsrael's military said it believed the drone -- an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances -- had traveled from Yemen, but rebuffed the Houthis' claim that their arsenal was capable of bypassing Israel's aerial defenses.\n\nAn Israeli military official said the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday but penetrated Israel because of \"human error\" in operating the system. The military's assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such strikes for months.\n\nThe strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv in months, hit at around 3:10 a.m. Local police said it reverberated to nearby cities and physically injured at least 10 people. Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air, however Israel's military said they had not determined whether the drone -- or pieces of it -- had struck buildings.\n\nIt blew out windows of a number of buildings and damaged cars in the neighborhood near the coastline. People thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel in Tel Aviv, said the blast shook him awake to watch the aftermath from his balcony and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war. He said many expected such a strike to come from the north, which the military said had not been the case.\n\nHearing it was human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone exploded, said some of his items had fallen but there was no major damage. While he hopes the war ends soon, he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. They maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom, however many have little or no connection to the war. Friday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas expanding into a regionwide conflagration as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The three-phase deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations. The country remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defense system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles. These systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. A military official said the system had identified the weapon but due to human error, was not set to alarm in case of attack.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nMetz reported from Rabat, Morocco.

But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nThe strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIt comes as international mediators continue to hold out hope for a cease-fire agreement, pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nThe prospects a deal could improve as Israeli leaders signal their operation underway in Rafah is close to finished. However, fears of potential escalation resurfaced on Thursday after Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Thursday to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nLocal police in Tel Aviv said that the Friday blast sounded at around 3:10 a.m., reverberating to nearby cities and physically injuring at least 10 people. Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air.\n\n\"The force of the explosion caused damage that is not great but is spread over a large area. At the moment we don't know what the object was,\" Amar said.\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defense system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles. These systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. It was not known which, if any, system was deployed.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's arch enemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"},

The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare\u00b4e, the Houthis\u00b4 spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group\u00b4s targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel\u00b4s aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\nThe strike hit hours after Israel\u00b4s military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon.

In recent weeks, Israel has stepped up strikes in central Gaza, where many Palestinians have fled to escape fighting in other parts of the beleaguered territory.\n\nHamas' Oct. 7 attack sparked the war when militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and abducting about 250. Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 38,600 people in Gaza, according to the territory\u00b4s Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nTwo international courts have accused Israel of war crimes and genocide - charges Israel denies. Most of Gaza\u00b4s 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza. Israeli restrictions, fighting and the breakdown of law and order have limited humanitarian aid efforts, causing widespread hunger and sparking fears of famine.\n\nHere\u00b4s the latest:\n\nBeirut - Lebanon\u00b4s militant Hezbollah group said it fired a volley of rockets on a northern Israeli village Friday morning in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes the night before on south Lebanon that killed several Hezbollah members and wounded civilians.\n\nIn another attack, the group also said that it used for the first time a new rocket with heavy warhead to strike an Israeli army post in the disputed Kfar Chouba hills. Hezbollah said in a statement that the Wabel rocket, produced by the group in Lebanon, destroyed parts of the Rweisat al-Alam post and caused a fire inside it.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters fired a salvo of rockets on the northern Israeli village of Abirim for the first time since fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border began in early October.\n\nHezbollah began firing rockets shortly after Hamas\u00b4 Oct. 7 attack, saying it aimed to ease pressure on Gaza. Since then, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed over 450 people, mostly Hezbollah members but also around 90 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 21 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed.\n\nTel Aviv - Yemen\u00b4s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone strike early Friday that hit part of central Tel Aviv near the U.S. Embassy, killing one person and injuring 10.\n\nThe aerial strike rumbled through the streets causing shards of shrapnel to rain down and spreading shards of glass over a large radius. The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare\u00b4e, the Houthis\u00b4 spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group\u00b4s targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel\u00b4s aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted to kill civilians in Israel,\" the official said of the strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv in months.\n\nCaution tape surrounds debris at the scene of a deadly explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel, early Friday, July 19, 2024.

But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nThe strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIt comes as international mediators continue to hold out hope for a ceasefire agreement, pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nLocal police in Tel Aviv said that the blast sounded at around 3:10 a.m. on Friday morning, reverberating to nearby cities and physically injuring at least 10 people. Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air.\n\n\"The force of the explosion caused damaged that is not great but is spread over a large area. At the moment we don't know what the object was,\" Amar said.\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defense system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles. These various systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. It was not known which, if any, system was deployed.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's arch enemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.", "source": {"uri": "greenfieldreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greenfield

However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\" The military's assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such strikes for months.\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted to kill civilians in Israel,\" the official said of the strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv in months.\n\nLocal police said the blast sounded at around 3:10 a.m., reverberating to nearby cities and physically injuring at least 10 people. Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air, however Israel's military said they had not determined whether the drone -- or pieces of it -- had struck buildings.\n\nIt blew out windows of a number of buildings and damaged cars in the neighborhood near the coastline. People thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead.\n\nMany of the roughly 60,000 Israelis evacuated from their homes earlier in the war have found housing in the area. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel in Tel Aviv said the blast shook him awake to watch the aftermath from his balcony and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war. He said many expected such a strike to come from the north, which the military said had not been the case.\n\nHearing it was a human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone exploded, said some of his items had fallen but there was no major damage. While he hopes the war ends soon, he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. They maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom however many have little or no connection to the war. Friday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas expanding into a regionwide conflagration as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The three-phase deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations. The country remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defense system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles. These systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. A military official said the system had identified the weapon but due to human error, was not set to alarm in case of attack.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's arch enemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.

But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nIsraeli police investigate the scene of a deadly explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel, Friday, July 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Oded Balilty)\n\nThe strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon\u00b4s Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIt comes as international mediators continue to hold out hope for a cease-fire agreement, pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nThe prospects a deal could improve as Israeli leaders signal their operation underway in Rafah is close to finished. However, fears of potential escalation resurfaced on Thursday after Israel\u00b4s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem\u00b4s most sensitive holy site on Thursday to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nLocal police in Tel Aviv said that the Friday blast sounded at around 3:10 a.m., reverberating to nearby cities and physically injuring at least 10 people. Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air.\n\n\"The force of the explosion caused damage that is not great but is spread over a large area. At the moment we don\u00b4t know what the object was,\" Amar said.\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defense system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles. These systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. It was not known which, if any, system was deployed.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel\u00b4s arch enemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel\u00b4s alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas\u00b4 Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory\u00b4s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas\u00b4 October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nFind more of AP\u00b4s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nA man films the scene after a deadly explosion, from his rooftop in Tel Aviv, Israel, Friday, July 19, 2024.

The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\nThe strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIt also came a day after Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Thursday, a move that threatened negotiations to end the 9-month-old war in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli negotiators were in Cairo on Wednesday to press ahead with talks on a cease-fire and hostage release deal, as Israel and Hamas consider the latest proposal. In recent weeks, Israel has stepped up strikes in central Gaza, where many Palestinians have fled to escape fighting in other parts of the beleaguered territory.\n\nHamas' Oct. 7 attack sparked the war when militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducting about 250. Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 38,600 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nTwo international courts have accused Israel of war crimes and genocide -- charges Israel denies. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza. Israeli restrictions, fighting and the breakdown of law and order have limited humanitarian aid efforts, causing widespread hunger and sparking fears of famine.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nHezbollah says it fired rockets on northern Israeli village\n\nBeirut -- Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group said it fired a volley of rockets on a northern Israeli village Friday morning in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes the night before on south Lebanon that killed several Hezbollah members and wounded civilians.\n\nIn another attack, the group also said that it used for the first time a new rocket with heavy warhead to strike an Israeli army post in the disputed Kfar Chouba hills. Hezbollah said in a statement that the Wabel rocket, produced by the group in Lebanon, destroyed parts of the Rweisat al-Alam post and caused a fire inside it.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters fired a salvo of rockets on the northern Israeli village of Abirim for the first time since fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border began in early October.\n\nHezbollah began firing rockets shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it aimed to ease pressure on Gaza. Since then, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed over 450 people, mostly Hezbollah members but also around 90 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 21 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed.\n\nYemen's Houthi rebels claim drone strike that hit Tel Aviv\n\nTel Aviv -- Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone strike early Friday that hit part of central Tel Aviv near the U.S. Embassy, killing one person and injuring 10.\n\nThe aerial strike rumbled through the streets causing shards of shrapnel to rain down and spreading shards of glass over a large radius. The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted to kill civilians in Israel,\" the official said of the strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv in months.", "source": {"uri": "maryvilleforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Maryville Forum"},

It said air patrols had been stepped up.\n\nThe Huthis, who have carried out dozens of attacks against Red Sea shipping to show support for Palestinians during the Gaza war, said their \"UAV force\" attacked \"one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv.\"\n\nThe rebels last Saturday had said they would \"not hesitate to expand its military operations... until the aggression stops\".\n\nIf an attack is confirmed, it would be the first to cause casualties in Tel Aviv since a rocket strike launched from Gaza wounded one person on May 26. Hundreds of rockets were fired at Tel Aviv in the October 7 attacks that set off the war, but most were intercepted.\n\nIsraeli police said they received hundreds of reports around 3:00 am (0000 GMT) of \"a strong explosion\".\n\nThe blast hit a building in a street near an annex of the US embassy in Israel, according to an AFP journalist, who saw broken windows.\n\nDuring the search, a man in his fifties was \"found dead in his apartment\" bearing injuries caused by shrapnel, police said.\n\nThe Magen David Adom emergency medical service said in a statement that it treated a man and a woman injured in their home, and two others hurt in the street. All four were taken to hospital with \"relatively minor\" injuries, it said.\n\n\"It may have been an aerial explosion... We were very lucky,\" said Peretz Amar, the Tel Aviv police commander, adding that \"the investigation is ongoing\".\n\n- 'Everything shook' -\n\nA Tel Aviv resident told AFP that he was awakened by the explosion and \"everything shook\".\n\nPolice called on residents to \"respect safety instructions and not to approach or touch debris or shrapnel that may contain explosives\".\n\nThe fire brigade said it was possible that a drone had caused the explosion.\n\nThe war in Gaza began with the October 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's military retaliation has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry.\n\nbur/mj/tw/it", "source": {"uri":

Associated Press\n\nYemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone strike early on Friday that hit part of central Tel Aviv near the US Embassy, killing one person and injuring 10.\n\nThe aerial strike rumbled through the streets causing shards of shrapnel to rain down and spreading shards of glass over a large radius. The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defence systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\" The military's assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such strikes for months.\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted to kill civilians in Israel,\" the official said of the strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv in months.\n\nA man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion in Tel Aviv on Friday. Reuters\n\nLocal police said the blast sounded at around 3.10am, reverberating to nearby cities and physically injuring at least 10 people. Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air, however Israel's military said they had not determined whether the drone - or pieces of it - had struck buildings.\n\nBlowing out windows, damaging cars\n\nIt blew out windows of a number of buildings and damaged cars in the neighbourhood near the coastline. People thronged the area as police helicopters hovered overhead.\n\nMany of the roughly 60,000 Israelis evacuated from their homes earlier in the war have found housing in the area. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel in Tel Aviv, said the blast shook him awake to watch the aftermath from his balcony and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war. He said many expected such a strike to come from the north, which the military said had not been the case.\n\nHearing it was a human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone exploded, said some of his items had fallen but there was no major damage. While he hopes the war ends soon, he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nRekindling fears\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. They maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom however many have little or no connection to the war. Friday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas expanding into a regionwide conflagration as international mediators continue to push for a ceasefire. The three-phase deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signalling its operation underway in Rafah nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations.\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defence system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles. These systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100 per cent effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. A military official said the system had identified the weapon but due to human error, was not set to alarm in case of attack.", "source": {"uri": "gulftoday.ae", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Gulf

Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said an initial investigation pointed to the attack having originated in Yemen.\n\nIf the Houthis are responsible, it would mark a significant escalation in their attacks on Israel which began in the wake of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October.\n\nUntil now, almost all Houthi missiles and drones fired towards Israel have been intercepted. None are known to have reached Tel Aviv.\n\nThe Israeli military official said its defense forces had detected the incoming drone but had not tried to shoot it down because of \"human error\".\n\nDramatic video filmed from the beach, said to capture the moment of the attack, appears to show a drone flying in over the Mediterranean Sea and buzzing loudly. It flies over buildings before disappearing, followed by a huge explosion moments later.\n\nPictures from the scene of the blast, near a branch of the US embassy, show a building with its windows blown out, and damaged cars and debris on the street below.\n\nThe attack happened at 03:12 (00:12 GMT) and the explosion was heard for several miles around.\n\nThe Times of Israel news site quoted the Israeli Air Force as saying the incident \"shouldn't have happened\", and that it took full responsibility for the failure to prevent it.\n\nSenior military correspondent for the Jerusalem Post, Yonah Jeremy Bob, said \"The Israeli defense establishment is in a state of complete shock\" over the attack.\n\n\"Though the writing was on the wall, no one saw it coming from a couple thousand kilometers away,\" he wrote.\n\nA military spokesman for the Houthis, Yahya Saree, said the strike had been conducted with a new drone capable of bypassing interception systems.\n\nHe declared Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial capital, \"an unsafe area,\" and said it \"will be a primary target within the range of our weapons\".\n\nThe Israeli military said it was increasing air patrols, while Tel Aviv's mayor said the city was on high alert, local media reported.\n\nAlon, a local resident, told Haaretz newspaper that when the blast happened \"the whole building shook.\"\n\n\"My neighbors' windows shattered, so I was sure something had hit the building. It was only when I went outside that I realised that several buildings had been damaged.\"\n\nThe incident also came after the Israeli military confirmed it had killed a senior commander of the Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah and Israel have traded fire across the border since Hezbollah launched rockets a day after Israel began its military offensive on Gaza in response to Hamas's deadly attack on Israel.\n\nHezbollah and the Houthis, which are both backed by Iran, say they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians. -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Times of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic mission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Jerusalem Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haaretz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2024/07/19/2407359.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 751, "textEnd": 760}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack and Israel's military said it believed the drone -- an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances -- originated in Yemen.\n\n\"We are holding an investigation today and in the coming days to understand exactly from where the threat was fired and what are the needed responses to defend the country and what are the attacking responses against who is threatening the state of Israel,\" said Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for Israel's military.\n\nThe Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the country's war with Hamas. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the Israel-Hamas war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nIsrael's military said it believed the drone -- an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances -- had traveled from Yemen, but rebuffed the Houthis' claim that their arsenal was capable of bypassing Israel's aerial defenses.\n\nAn Israeli military official said the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday but penetrated Israel because of \"human error\" in operating the system. The military's assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such strikes for months.\n\nThe strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv in months, hit at around 3:10 a.m. Local police said it reverberated to nearby cities and physically injured at least 10 people. Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air, however Israel's military said they had not determined whether the drone -- or pieces of it -- had struck buildings.\n\nIt blew out windows of a number of buildings and damaged cars in the neighborhood near the coastline. People thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel in Tel Aviv, said the blast shook him awake to watch the aftermath from his balcony and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war. He said many expected such a strike to come from the north, which the military said had not been the case.\n\nHearing it was human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone exploded, said some of his items had fallen but there was no major damage. While he hopes the war ends soon, he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. They maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom, however many have little or no connection to the war. Friday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas expanding into a regionwide conflagration as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The three-phase deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations. The country remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defense system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles. These systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. A military official said the system had identified the weapon but due to human error, was not set to alarm in case of attack.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nMetz reported from Rabat, Morocco.

The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\nThe strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIt also came a day after Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Thursday, a move that threatened negotiations to end the 9-month-old war in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli negotiators were in Cairo on Wednesday to press ahead with talks on a cease-fire and hostage release deal, as Israel and Hamas consider the latest proposal. In recent weeks, Israel has stepped up strikes in central Gaza, where many Palestinians have fled to escape fighting in other parts of the beleaguered territory.\n\nHamas' Oct. 7 attack sparked the war when militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducting about 250. Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 38,600 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nTwo international courts have accused Israel of war crimes and genocide -- charges Israel denies. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza. Israeli restrictions, fighting and the breakdown of law and order have limited humanitarian aid efforts, causing widespread hunger and sparking fears of famine.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nHezbollah says it fired rockets on northern Israeli village\n\nBeirut -- Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group said it fired a volley of rockets on a northern Israeli village Friday morning in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes the night before on south Lebanon that killed several Hezbollah members and wounded civilians.\n\nIn another attack, the group also said that it used for the first time a new rocket with heavy warhead to strike an Israeli army post in the disputed Kfar Chouba hills. Hezbollah said in a statement that the Wabel rocket, produced by the group in Lebanon, destroyed parts of the Rweisat al-Alam post and caused a fire inside it.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters fired a salvo of rockets on the northern Israeli village of Abirim for the first time since fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border began in early October.\n\nHezbollah began firing rockets shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it aimed to ease pressure on Gaza. Since then, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed over 450 people, mostly Hezbollah members but also around 90 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 21 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed.\n\nYemen's Houthi rebels claim drone strike that hit Tel Aviv\n\nTel Aviv -- Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone strike early Friday that hit part of central Tel Aviv near the U.S. Embassy, killing one person and injuring 10.\n\nThe aerial strike rumbled through the streets causing shards of shrapnel to rain down and spreading shards of glass over a large radius. The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted to kill civilians in Israel,\" the official said of the strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv in months.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war.\n\nIran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' October 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry.\n\nThe war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage.

Daniel Hagari said in a press conference.\n\nThe drone, identified by the IDF as an Iranian-made Samad-3 which had been modified to have an extended range, had flown to the country for several hours at a low altitude, according to the probe.\n\nA man in his 50s was killed by shrapnel from the explosion, Magen David Adom said. According to the ambulance service, the man was found lifeless in a building.\n\nMDA also said eight people were taken to local hospitals, four of whom were wounded by shrapnel or the shock waves from the blast. The other four are being treated for acute anxiety.\n\nThe impact site was adjacent to several hotels and the United States' Tel Aviv Embassy Branch Office.\n\nMany of the hotels in the area are currently housing displaced Israelis who have had to leave their homes on the northern and southern borders amid the ongoing war.\n\nA man who lives near the impact site said that the massive blast came out of nowhere.\n\n\"I went to bed and suddenly I heard an explosion like I've never heard before. I thought maybe I hadn't heard the sirens,\" the man, named as Aviel, told the Kan public broadcaster. \"After seven months serving in the reserves, I thought we had left the country in a better state. The whole building is covered in dust and things fell on us in the apartment\"\n\nA video filmed by a beachgoer showed the buzzing explosive-laden drone flying at a low altitude into Tel Aviv from the direction of the sea, before impacting an apartment building.\n\nOther surveillance camera footage also showed the impact.\n\nThe IAF believed the drone came from Yemen, Hagari said in his press conference. The Houthis in Yemen took responsibility for the attack earlier in the day.\n\nYemen's Houthis' military spokesperson said the group attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.\n\nThe spokesman said that Tel Aviv will continue to be a primary target for the terror group \"within the range of our weapons.\"\n\nThe group claimed it had launched a drone that could bypass radar detection systems.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the IAF, a US Central Command announcement on Friday describing Houthi missiles and drones being destroyed, referred to incidents on Thursday morning and was not directly related to the overnight attack.\n\nAlso overnight, one drone heading toward Israel from the eastern direction, likely originating from Iraq, was shot down by fighter jets outside of Israeli airspace, according to the IAF.\n\nAnd on Friday morning, a suspected drone that entered Israeli airspace from Lebanon was shot down by air defenses, the Israel Defense Forces said. Sirens had sounded in the Galilee over fears of falling shrapnel.\n\n'Shouldn't have happened'\n\nThe IAF said the incident in Tel Aviv \"shouldn't have happened\" and it took full responsibility for the failure that led to the deadly attack.\n\nIn a statement, the IDF said the attack was under \"thorough investigation.\"\n\nThe military also said the IAF would increase patrols by fighter jets \"to defend Israeli skies\"\n\n\"There is no change in the Home Front Command's orders,\" it added.\n\nHagari said the military was to hold assessments on the attack in the coming days to understand what it needs to adjust to better defend, and \"what the required offensive response will be against those who threaten Israel.\"\n\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant, meanwhile, said Israel would respond.\n\n\"The defense establishment is working to immediately strengthen all defense systems, and will settle the score with anyone who harms the State of Israel or directs terror against it,\" he said in remarks provided by his office following an assessment held with IDF officials on the Houthi drone attack.\n\nGallant met with IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, head of the Operations Directorate Maj. Gen. Oded Basiuk, head of the Intelligence Directorate Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, the Israeli Air Force's chief of staff Brig. Gen. Omer Tischler, and the head of the Intelligence Directorate's research division, Brig. Gen. Ofir Mizrahi Rosen.\n\nTel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai said in a statement that the city was \"moving to a higher state of alert\" following the attack.\n\n\"The war is still here, and it is difficult and painful,\" Huldai added. \"We are prepared for developments if there are any,\" he said, calling on the public to follow all instructions.\n\nNumerous Houthi attacks in past months\n\nYemen's Houthis have fired dozens of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and drones at Israel -- mostly toward the southernmost city of Eilat -- in solidarity with the Gaza Strip, where Israel is battling Hamas terrorists.\n\nThe vast majority of the Iran-backed group's projectiles have been intercepted by US forces stationed in the Red Sea and Israeli air defenses and fighter jets, or missed their target. Previously, only one Houthi projectile, a cruise missile, struck Israel, hitting an open area near Eilat in March.\n\nIn an apparent policy, Israel has so far not responded to any of the Houthi attacks.\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthis, who seized Yemen's capital Sanaa in 2014 and control large swaths of the country, are \"part of the axis of resistance\" against Israel along with Hamas -- which is also sponsored by Tehran.\n\nHouthi rebels have expressed support for the Palestinians and threatened Israel amid the Israel-Hamas war. The Iranian-backed group's slogan is \"Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse the Jews, Victory to Islam.\"\n\nIn the Red Sea, the Houthis have fired on commercial and military ships dozens of times since November.\n\nThe Houthis say they are targeting ships over Israel's offensive in Gaza against Hamas. But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperiling shipping in a key route for global trade between Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.\n\nOther Iran-backed groups, in Iraq and Syria, have also claimed to have launched dozens of drones and cruise missiles at Israel during the ongoing war sparked by Hamas's devastating October 7 terror onslaught, while Lebanon's Hezbollah has attacked communities and IDF positions in northern Israel on a near-daily basis.\n\nIran itself also carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel in April with hundreds of drones and missiles.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesofisrael.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement",

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Sare'e said the operation was performed by a new drone capable of \"bypassing the enemy's interception systems.\"\n\n\"We will continue to strike these targets in response to the enemy's massacres and daily crimes against our brothers in the Gaza Strip,\" Sare'e said. \"Our operations will only cease when the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.\"\n\nThe attack marked the first time Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial center, has been struck by a drone in an attack claimed by the Houthis.\n\nIn a televised briefing on Friday, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the military suspects the drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model, launched from Yemen, which had been upgraded to extend its range.\n\nA second drone was intercepted outside of Israeli territory to the east at the same time as the attack, he said, adding that Israel is now upgrading its air defenses and increasing aerial patrols of its borders.\n\nAn Israeli military official said the drone was detected by an Israeli aerial defense system, but not intercepted due to \"human error.\" It was armed with a warhead and crashed into an apartment building, the official added, without providing further details of the device's payload.\n\nThe official didn't provide details about what the human error was but noted that Israel's aerial defense systems don't always operate autonomously. The Iron Dome defense system, for example, can operate in manual mode, where its radar detects and tracks incoming threats but needs input from an operator before launching an interceptor missile.\n\nAccording to an initial inquiry \"no sirens were activated\" during the incident, the IDF said earlier.\n\nJack Lew, the US Ambassador to Israel, said Friday he was \"shocked by the brazen Houthi drone attack\" and sent his condolences to the victims' families. \"We are thankful our US Embassy Branch Office personnel are safe,\" he added.\n\nDeadly explosion\n\nThe explosion occurred in a central district home to a number of diplomatic missions, and hit about 100 meters (330 feet) from a US Embassy branch office, according to CNN analysis and information from local authorities.\n\nThere was no damage to the US diplomatic mission and no reports of injuries of US personnel or \"locally engaged staff,\" the US State Department said.\n\n\"We are in close contact with Israeli authorities to fully investigate the source of the explosion and its intended target,\" the spokesperson said, adding the embassy in Jerusalem and the branch in Tel Aviv are ready to provide consular assistance to US citizens.\n\nEmergency crews responded to \"an object\" that had exploded on Shalom Aleichem Street, Israel's Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said.\n\n\"The dead man had suffered penetrating injuries,\" MDA paramedic Roi Klein said. At least four of the injured sustained shrapnel wounds, the MDA said.\n\nIsraeli far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the Israeli government for being unable to protect the country, saying on social media that the attack showed the government \"cannot give security to the citizens of Israel.\"\n\n\"There are no policies, no plans, all public relations and discussions are about themselves,\" he said.\n\nBen Gvir said the attack on Tel Aviv and other areas of Israel are \"precisely why I insist on being around the table in determining Israel's policy.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June disbanded the country's war cabinet after former war cabinet member Benny Gantz announced his withdrawal from the body, and Ben Gvir asked to join.\n\nHouthi attacks\n\nThe Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted Israel with drones and missiles since the start of the country's war with Hamas, most of which have been intercepted by Israel's defenses.\n\nThe Houthis have also been attacking US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following Hamas' October 7 attack, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others kidnapped.\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive on Gaza has killed more than 38,000 people in the enclave, according to Palestinian authorities. The war has displaced almost all of the strip's population of more than 2 million people, turned swaths of the territory into rubble and triggered a massive humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe war has raised fears of a wider regional conflict, with the potential consequences of further human suffering and shocks to the global economy. The Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, for instance, have forced some of the world's biggest shipping and oil companies to suspend transit through one of the most important maritime trade routes.\n\nSare'e, the Houthi spokesperson, said the operation targeting Tel Aviv was carried out with a new drone called \"Yafa\" that can \"bypass the enemy's interception system and (is) undetectable by radars.\"\n\nFabian Hinz, a research fellow for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, wrote on X that Houthi claims shouldn't be taken at face value.\n\n\"In general, Houthi claims are a mixed bag. Sometimes they are accurate, sometimes they are exaggerated, sometimes they are just straight-up fabrications,\" he wrote, adding that \"their factual claims have to be taken with a much bigger grain of salt than Iran's or Lebanese Hezbollah's.\"\n\nHe said however that the drone used in the Tel Aviv attack is likely to be a Sammad, \"the Houthi's standard long-range strike drone\" that has already been used in attacks against Israel, but with a more powerful engine.\n\nFor the Houthis, he wrote, an extended drone range would be attractive \"as it would allow them to strike targets further away, fly routes evading enemy defenses, and attack from unexpected angles.\"\n\nAhmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, told CNN that the Houthis are likely to capitalize on the attack, especially as Israel's defenses failed to intercept it.\n\n\"They will capitalize on it, not just inside Yemen but also outside Yemen,\" Nagi said, adding that the attack took place ahead of the rebel group's weekly rallies, which take place every Friday in support of Gaza in Houthi-controlled Yemeni cities. The attack \"gives momentum\" to these rallies, he said.\n\nThe drone attack Friday in Tel Aviv comes after the Houthis claimed earlier this month that they had targeted ships in the Israeli port of Haifa with a number of drones in joint military operations with Iran-backed militias based in Iraq.\n\nThe IDF told CNN at the time that it was not aware of such an incident.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\nThe strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIt also came a day after Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Thursday, a move that threatened negotiations to end the 9-month-old war in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli negotiators were in Cairo on Wednesday to press ahead with talks on a cease-fire and hostage release deal, as Israel and Hamas consider the latest proposal. In recent weeks, Israel has stepped up strikes in central Gaza, where many Palestinians have fled to escape fighting in other parts of the beleaguered territory.\n\nHamas' Oct. 7 attack sparked the war when militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducting about 250. Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 38,600 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nTwo international courts have accused Israel of war crimes and genocide -- charges Israel denies. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza. Israeli restrictions, fighting and the breakdown of law and order have limited humanitarian aid efforts, causing widespread hunger and sparking fears of famine.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nBeirut -- Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group said it fired a volley of rockets on a northern Israeli village Friday morning in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes the night before on south Lebanon that killed several Hezbollah members and wounded civilians.\n\nIn another attack, the group also said that it used for the first time a new rocket with heavy warhead to strike an Israeli army post in the disputed Kfar Chouba hills. Hezbollah said in a statement that the Wabel rocket, produced by the group in Lebanon, destroyed parts of the Rweisat al-Alam post and caused a fire inside it.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters fired a salvo of rockets on the northern Israeli village of Abirim for the first time since fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border began in early October.\n\nHezbollah began firing rockets shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it aimed to ease pressure on Gaza. Since then, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed over 450 people, mostly Hezbollah members but also around 90 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 21 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed.\n\nTel Aviv -- Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone strike early Friday that hit part of central Tel Aviv near the U.S. Embassy, killing one person and injuring 10.\n\nThe aerial strike rumbled through the streets causing shards of shrapnel to rain down and spreading shards of glass over a large radius. The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted to kill civilians in Israel,\" the official said of the strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv in months.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

No warning siren was heard.\n\nShortly after the incident, the Israeli military issued a statement saying that a preliminary inquiry revealed that the explosion had been caused by \"the fall of an aerial target, which did not trigger a warning. The incident is now thoroughly investigated. Many [security] forces are now operating at the scene. The air force has multiplied its airplane patrols, to protect the country's skies. There are no changes in the instructions of the Homeland Command.\"\n\nAccording to Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya TV, the US military intercepted a ballistic missile and three drones launched overnight by the Houthis toward Israel, but a fourth drone managed to hit Tel Aviv.\n\nThe Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack through a spokesperson. In a message posted to X, the spokesperson referred to the drone attack as a \"military operation on the occupied Jaffa area known as 'Tel Aviv.'\" The Houthi representative further claimed that the group has a new drone dubbed Jaffa, which is \"capable of bypassing interception systems and radars cannot detect it.\"\n\nThe Israeli military said Friday morning that the long-range drone had apparently been launched from the south, but stressed that all possibilities are being verified, Haaretz reported. The drone was identified by the Israeli Air Force but not intercepted due to human error. The matter is under investigation. The air force said that during the night, another drone launched from the east had exploded, possibly launched to interfere with detecting the one that exploded in Tel Aviv.\n\nIsraeli military radio reported three drone explosions overnight -- the one in Tel Aviv, apparently fired from Yemen; one drone that exploded outside Israeli airspace, apparently launched from Iraq; and a drone fired from Lebanon, which was intercepted in the over the Upper Galilee.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al-Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Arabiya", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Arabiya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaffa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jaffa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_strikes_in_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drone strikes in Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Galilee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upper Galilee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interceptor_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interceptor aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haaretz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.al-monitor.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_share/public/2024-07/GettyImages-2161997433.jpg?h=6489897e&itok=jpeJiM9P", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 78, "textEnd": 85}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air, however Israel's military said they had not determined whether the drone -- or pieces of it -- had struck buildings.\n\nIt blew out windows of a number of buildings and damaged cars in the neighborhood near the coastline. People thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel in Tel Aviv, said the blast shook him awake to watch the aftermath from his balcony and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war. He said many expected such a strike to come from the north, which the military said had not been the case.\n\nHearing it was human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone exploded, said some of his items had fallen but there was no major damage. While he hopes the war ends soon, he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. They maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom, however many have little or no connection to the war. Friday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas expanding into a regionwide conflagration as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The three-phase deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations. The country remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defense system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles. These systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. A military official said the system had identified the weapon but due to human error, was not set to alarm in case of attack.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nMetz reported from Rabat, Morocco.

But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nThe group lauded the drone's ability to bypass Israel's air defenses and said they aim to reach deep into Israel in response to the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas militants, which is now in its ninth month.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIt comes as international mediators continue to hold out hope for a cease-fire agreement, pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nThe prospects a deal could improve as Israeli leaders signal their operation underway in Rafah is close to finished. However, fears of potential escalation resurfaced on Thursday after Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Thursday to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nLocal police in Tel Aviv said that the Friday blast sounded at around 3:10 a.m., reverberating to nearby cities and physically injuring at least 10 people. Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air.\n\n\"The force of the explosion caused damage that is not great but is spread over a large area. At the moment we don't know what the object was,\" Amar said.\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defense system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles. These systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. It was not known which, if any, system was deployed.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's arch enemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Hezbollah.\n\nThe attack also comes days before Netanyahu is to travel to Washington and address Congress.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nAnalysts and Western intelligence services have long accused Iran of arming the group, a claim that Tehran denies. In recent years, US naval forces have intercepted a number of ships packed with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and missile parts en route from Iran to Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.\n\nThe Houthis maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom. However, many have little or no connection to the war.\n\nFriday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza becoming a region-wide conflagration.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah is nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire.\n\nThe deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 Israeli hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nIsrael remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, disavowing the idea.\n\nOn Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael's air defense system has intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war, including Hamas rocket fire from Gaza. But officials warn the systems are not 100 per cent effective and appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided direct confrontations with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' October 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.

The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\nThe strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIt also came a day after Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Thursday, a move that threatened negotiations to end the 9-month-old war in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli negotiators were in Cairo on Wednesday to press ahead with talks on a cease-fire and hostage release deal, as Israel and Hamas consider the latest proposal. In recent weeks, Israel has stepped up strikes in central Gaza, where many Palestinians have fled to escape fighting in other parts of the beleaguered territory.\n\nHamas' Oct. 7 attack sparked the war when militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducting about 250. Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 38,600 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nTwo international courts have accused Israel of war crimes and genocide -- charges Israel denies. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza. Israeli restrictions, fighting and the breakdown of law and order have limited humanitarian aid efforts, causing widespread hunger and sparking fears of famine.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nHezbollah says it fired rockets on northern Israeli village\n\nBeirut -- Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group said it fired a volley of rockets on a northern Israeli village Friday morning in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes the night before on south Lebanon that killed several Hezbollah members and wounded civilians.\n\nIn another attack, the group also said that it used for the first time a new rocket with heavy warhead to strike an Israeli army post in the disputed Kfar Chouba hills. Hezbollah said in a statement that the Wabel rocket, produced by the group in Lebanon, destroyed parts of the Rweisat al-Alam post and caused a fire inside it.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters fired a salvo of rockets on the northern Israeli village of Abirim for the first time since fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border began in early October.\n\nHezbollah began firing rockets shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it aimed to ease pressure on Gaza. Since then, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed over 450 people, mostly Hezbollah members but also around 90 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 21 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed.\n\nYemen's Houthi rebels claim drone strike that hit Tel Aviv\n\nTel Aviv -- Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone strike early Friday that hit part of central Tel Aviv near the U.S. Embassy, killing one person and injuring 10.\n\nThe aerial strike rumbled through the streets causing shards of shrapnel to rain down and spreading shards of glass over a large radius. The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel.

However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted

It said air patrols had been stepped up.\n\nThe Huthis, who have carried out dozens of attacks against Red Sea shipping to show support for Palestinians during the Gaza war, said their \"UAV force\" attacked \"one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv.\"\n\nThe rebels last Saturday had said they would \"not hesitate to expand its military operations... until the aggression stops\".\n\nIf an attack is confirmed, it would be the first to cause casualties in Tel Aviv since a rocket strike launched from Gaza wounded one person on May 26. Hundreds of rockets were fired at Tel Aviv in the October 7 attacks that set off the war, but most were intercepted.\n\nIsraeli police said they received hundreds of reports around 3:00 am (0000 GMT) of \"a strong explosion\".\n\nThe blast hit a building in a street near an annex of the US embassy in Israel, according to an AFP journalist, who saw broken windows.\n\nDuring the search, a man in his fifties was \"found dead in his apartment\" bearing injuries caused by shrapnel, police said.\n\nThe Magen David Adom emergency medical service said in a statement that it treated a man and a woman injured in their home, and two others hurt in the street. All four were taken to hospital with \"relatively minor\" injuries, it said.\n\nMore from this section Prince William 'adamant' on Prince Harry stance amid bitter royal row - Michael Cole Teens for Trump?

the explosion and \"everything shook\".\n\nPolice called on residents to \"respect safety instructions and not to approach or touch debris or shrapnel that may contain explosives\".\n\nThe fire brigade said it was possible that a drone had caused the explosion.\n\nThe war in Gaza began with the October 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's military retaliation has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry.\n\nbur/mj/tw/it", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com",

The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\nThe strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIt also came a day after Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Thursday, a move that threatened negotiations to end the 9-month-old war in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli negotiators were in Cairo on Wednesday to press ahead with talks on a cease-fire and hostage release deal, as Israel and Hamas consider the latest proposal. In recent weeks, Israel has stepped up strikes in central Gaza, where many Palestinians have fled to escape fighting in other parts of the beleaguered territory.\n\nHamas' Oct. 7 attack sparked the war when militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducting about 250. Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 38,600 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nTwo international courts have accused Israel of war crimes and genocide -- charges Israel denies. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza. Israeli restrictions, fighting and the breakdown of law and order have limited humanitarian aid efforts, causing widespread hunger and sparking fears of famine.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nHezbollah says it fired rockets on northern Israeli village\n\nBeirut -- Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group said it fired a volley of rockets on a northern Israeli village Friday morning in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes the night before on south Lebanon that killed several Hezbollah members and wounded civilians.\n\nIn another attack, the group also said that it used for the first time a new rocket with heavy warhead to strike an Israeli army post in the disputed Kfar Chouba hills. Hezbollah said in a statement that the Wabel rocket, produced by the group in Lebanon, destroyed parts of the Rweisat al-Alam post and caused a fire inside it.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters fired a salvo of rockets on the northern Israeli village of Abirim for the first time since fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border began in early October.\n\nHezbollah began firing rockets shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it aimed to ease pressure on Gaza. Since then, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed over 450 people, mostly Hezbollah members but also around 90 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 21 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed.\n\nYemen's Houthi rebels claim drone strike that hit Tel Aviv\n\nTel Aviv -- Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone strike early Friday that hit part of central Tel Aviv near the U.S. Embassy, killing one person and injuring 10.\n\nThe aerial strike rumbled through the streets causing shards of shrapnel to rain down and spreading shards of glass over a large radius.

However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\" The military's assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such strikes for months.\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted to kill civilians in Israel,\" the official said of the strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv in months.\n\nLocal police said the blast sounded at around 3:10 a.m., reverberating to nearby cities and physically injuring at least 10 people. Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air, however Israel's military said they had not determined whether the drone -- or pieces of it -- had struck buildings.\n\nIt blew out windows of a number of buildings and damaged cars in the neighborhood near the coastline. People thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead.\n\nMany of the roughly 60,000 Israelis evacuated from their homes earlier in the war have found housing in the area. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel in Tel Aviv said the blast shook him awake to watch the aftermath from his balcony and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war. He said many expected such a strike to come from the north, which the military said had not been the case.\n\nHearing it was a human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone exploded, said some of his items had fallen but there was no major damage. While he hopes the war ends soon, he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. They maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom however many have little or no connection to the war. Friday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas expanding into a regionwide conflagration as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The three-phase deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations. The country remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defense system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles. These systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. A military official said the system had identified the weapon but due to human error, was not set to alarm in case of attack.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's arch enemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war.

The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\" The military's assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such strikes for months.\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted to kill civilians in Israel,\" the official said of the strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv in months.\n\nLocal police said the blast sounded at around 3:10 a.m., reverberating to nearby cities and physically injuring at least 10 people. Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air, however Israel's military said they had not determined whether the drone -- or pieces of it -- had struck buildings.\n\nIt blew out windows of a number of buildings and damaged cars in the neighborhood near the coastline. People thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead.\n\nMany of the roughly 60,000 Israelis evacuated from their homes earlier in the war have found housing in the area. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel in Tel Aviv said the blast shook him awake to watch the aftermath from his balcony and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war. He said many expected such a strike to come from the north, which the military said had not been the case.\n\nHearing it was a human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone exploded, said some of his items had fallen but there was no major damage. While he hopes the war ends soon, he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. They maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom however many have little or no connection to the war. Friday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas expanding into a regionwide conflagration as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The three-phase deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations. The country remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defense system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles. These systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. A military official said the system had identified the weapon but due to human error, was not set to alarm in case of attack.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's arch enemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nMetz reported from Rabat, Morocco.

The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\nThe strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIt also came a day after Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Thursday, a move that threatened negotiations to end the 9-month-old war in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli negotiators were in Cairo on Wednesday to press ahead with talks on a cease-fire and hostage release deal, as Israel and Hamas consider the latest proposal. In recent weeks, Israel has stepped up strikes in central Gaza, where many Palestinians have fled to escape fighting in other parts of the beleaguered territory.\n\nHamas' Oct. 7 attack sparked the war when militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducting about 250. Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 38,600 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nTwo international courts have accused Israel of war crimes and genocide -- charges Israel denies. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza. Israeli restrictions, fighting and the breakdown of law and order have limited humanitarian aid efforts, causing widespread hunger and sparking fears of famine.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nHezbollah says it fired rockets on northern Israeli village\n\nBeirut -- Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group said it fired a volley of rockets on a northern Israeli village Friday morning in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes the night before on south Lebanon that killed several Hezbollah members and wounded civilians.\n\nIn another attack, the group also said that it used for the first time a new rocket with heavy warhead to strike an Israeli army post in the disputed Kfar Chouba hills. Hezbollah said in a statement that the Wabel rocket, produced by the group in Lebanon, destroyed parts of the Rweisat al-Alam post and caused a fire inside it.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters fired a salvo of rockets on the northern Israeli village of Abirim for the first time since fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border began in early October.\n\nHezbollah began firing rockets shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it aimed to ease pressure on Gaza. Since then, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed over 450 people, mostly Hezbollah members but also around 90 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 21 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed.\n\nYemen's Houthi rebels claim drone strike that hit Tel Aviv\n\nTel Aviv -- Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone strike early Friday that hit part of central Tel Aviv near the U.S. Embassy, killing one person and injuring 10.\n\nThe aerial strike rumbled through the streets causing shards of shrapnel to rain down and spreading shards of glass over a large radius.

The Israeli military said it was still investigating the episode, including who had launched the drone, which was carrying explosives.\n\nA large drone that can fly long distances struck an apartment building just after 3 a.m. local time, said an Israeli military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak more freely. No alarms were activated in the attack, the Israeli military said earlier in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for the Houthi militia, Yahya Sarea, said in a televised statement that the group had targeted Tel Aviv and that it would continue to target the city. The militia, which is based in Yemen, used a new drone that can get past Israel's defense systems and is not detected by radar, he added.\n\nThe Israeli military official said it was possible that the country's defense systems registered the drone but misidentified it. Because the drone was capable of traveling long distances, the military was not ruling out any possibilities and was looking into the possibility that it had been launched from Yemen, the official said, adding that no more attacks were thought to be headed toward Israel.\n\nSince November, the Houthis have been attacking ships in a vital route in the Red Sea in a campaign in support of Palestinians. The military official said that dozens of drones had been launched at Israel since the war with Hamas began in October.\n\nRon Huldai, the mayor of Tel Aviv, said the city was on heightened alert.\n\n\"The war is still here, and it is hard and painful,\" he said on social media, referring to Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAsked whether Israel would respond to the attack, the military official said it would first work to fully assess the situation.\n\nThe body of a 50-year-old man was found in a nearby apartment building as emergency workers were combing through the area around the explosion, according to a statement from Zaki Heller, a spokesman for Israel's national emergency service. The man was found in his apartment and had shrapnel injuries, the Tel Aviv police said in a statement.\n\nThe police said 10 people had been wounded and described them as \"lightly injured.\" Four of them suffered penetrating and blunt force trauma, said Roee Klein, a paramedic for the national emergency service, in a video.\n\nWitnesses described a \"very loud explosion\" that could be heard miles away. Surveillance video widely circulated on social media and verified by Storyful shows a bright flash of light, followed by a boom and the sound of an alarm.\n\nThe police said that a large number of forces was responding to the explosion.

Most have failed even to reach Israel's southernmost city, Eilat, on the Red Sea some 270 kilometers (160 miles) south of Tel Aviv.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was investigating what went wrong. Chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the drone was detected by air defenses, but an \"error\" occurred and \"there was no interception.\"\n\n\"We are investigating the entire chain,\" he said. Another military official blamed \"human error.\" The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.\n\nThe spokesman for the Houthis, Yahya Sare'e, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement published on the social media platform X. He said it was in retaliation for the Israel-Hamas war and had hit one of the group's many targets.\n\nIsrael's military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.\n\nThe drone hit at around 3:10 a.m., blowing out windows and damaging cars throughout a coastal neighborhood of Tel Aviv and reverberating as far as nearby cities. The military said it had not determined if it exploded in the air or directly struck buildings.\n\nFootage verified by the AP shows the low-flying drone arriving at Tel Aviv's shoreline and then heading into the city, moments before an explosion lights up the night sky.\n\nIn one building, the Sajiv family swept up the shattered glass of their apartment's balcony door. Limor Sajiv said they were woken by the sound of a blast. \"We had no idea what it was. I mean, we heard missiles before we heard things, this was different, really, really loud,\" he said.\n\nPeople thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with the military's handling of the war since October.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona, said he was shaken awake in the hotel he lives in. Hearing it was human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone is believed to have exploded, said he hopes the war ends soon, but he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said there was no damage to the U.S. Embassy or any of its staff members.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Hezbollah.\n\nThe attack also comes days before Netanyahu is to travel to Washington and address Congress.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nAnalysts and Western intelligence services have long accused Iran of arming the group, a claim that Tehran denies. In recent years, U.S. naval forces have intercepted a number of ships packed with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and missile parts en route from Iran to Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.\n\nThe Houthis maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom. However, many have little or no connection to the war.\n\nFriday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza becoming a regionwide conflagration.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah is nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 Israeli hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nIsrael remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael's air defense system has intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war, including Hamas rocket fire from Gaza. But officials warn the systems are not 100% effective and appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided direct confrontations with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.\n\n___\n\nMetz reported from Rabat, Morocco.

The drone was detected by air surveillance but was not shot down due to human error, the Times of Israel newspaper reported.\n\nA military spokeswoman confirmed upon inquiry that there was no air raid alarm when there should have been one. Tel Aviv has largely been spared from drone attacks so far.\n\nThe site of the explosion could hardly have been more central, situated in the historic heart of the Mediterranean metropolis.

The Israeli military is investigating the incident and has increased air patrols. The strike, which was initially described as an \"aerial target,\" evaded Israel's air defenses. The nature of the attack and how it bypassed defenses remain unclear. A large explosion rumbled through the streets of central Tel Aviv early Friday morning after an apparent drone strike caused shards of shrapnel to rain down and injure at least 10 people, authorities said. Israel's military said that they were reviewing the explosion and increasing air patrols after the incident, which its initial inquiries determined was caused by \"an aerial target.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the strike evaded Israel's air defences or how Israel might respond.\n\nTel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai on X called the attack a drone strike, though the military has not yet specified the nature of the attack. Yemen's Houthis have repeatedly launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the nine-month-long war in sympathy with Hamas. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nThe country has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nLocal police said that the blast sounded at around 3:10 a.m. on Friday morning, reverberating to nearby cities and physically injuring at least 10 people. Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air.\n\n\"The force of the explosion caused damaged that is not great but is spread over a large area. At the moment we don't know what the object was,\" Amar said.\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defence system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles. These various systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. It was not known which, if any, system was deployed.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's arch enemy, Iran.

The site was sealed off by police tape.\n\nReporting from Doha, Qatar, Al Jazeera's Mohammed Jamjoom said the attack has created a new wave of anxiety in Israel.\n\nThe Israeli government has banned Al Jazeera from broadcasting from the country.\n\n\"Where this drone hit is a part of the city that is very close to the US embassy branch office. It's a very densely populated area, a high-security area,\" Jamjoom said.\n\nIf the drone is confirmed to be Houthi and passed through Israel's radar systems undetected, \"there's going to be a lot of people in Israel concerned about what this means\", said Jamjoom.\n\n\"How did this happen at a time when the country is under such high alert?\"\n\nIsraeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said they will continue to assess the drone attack in the coming days to adjust its defences and decide on a suitable \"offensive response\".\n\nIsraeli opposition politician Yair Lapid said the attack was \"further proof that this government does not know and cannot give security to the citizens of Israel\".\n\n\"Those who lose deterrence in the north and south also lose it in the heart of Tel Aviv. There are no policies, no plans, all public relations and discussions about themselves. They [the government] have to go,\" the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party wrote on X.\n\nThe Houthis have repeatedly launched drones and missiles towards Israel and at Israeli-linked shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in a show of support for Palestinians amid Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nUntil the early morning attack on Friday, all attempts to hit Israel by the Houthis were intercepted by either Israeli defences or Western allies with forces stationed in the region, The Associated Press news agency reported.\n\nHezbollah in southern Lebanon has also stepped up attacks against military targets in northern Israel, saying they are also acting in solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel's war on Gaza, which has killed almost 39,000 people.\n\nFollowing the latest drone attack, Hezbollah welcomed the development as \"a triumph for the oppression of the Palestinian people and their fighters\".\n\nIt said the Yemeni fighters were supporting \"the heroic\" Palestinian fighters in Gaza who in turn are defending \"all our people and countries of our Arab and Islamic nations\".\n\nThe group said the fight will not stop until \"the aggression and the siege of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is stopped\".", "source": {"uri": "shafaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u064a\u0629

Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of impact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air.\n\n\"The force of the explosion caused damage that is not extensive but is spread over a large area. At the moment, we don't know what the object was,\" Amar said.\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defense system capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles.\n\nThese systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war.\n\nHowever, officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems have struggled against small, hard-to-detect drones. It was not known which system, if any, was deployed.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's arch-enemy, Iran.\n\nIsrael has largely avoided direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war.\n\nIran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel in April in response to the alleged assassination of two Iranian generals in Syria.\n\nThe war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 incursion on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry.\n\nThe conflict has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displacing most of its 2.3 million population and triggering widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and the group took about 250 hostages.",

Most have failed even to reach Israel's southernmost city, Eilat, on the Red Sea some 160 miles south of Tel Aviv.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was investigating what went wrong. Chief spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the drone was detected by air defenses, but an \"error\" occurred and \"there was no interception.\"\n\n\"We are investigating the entire chain,\" he said. Another military official blamed \"human error.\" The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.\n\nHouthi spokesman Yahya Sare'e claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement published on the social media platform X. He said it was in retaliation for the Israel-Hamas war and had hit one of the group's many targets.\n\nIsrael's military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.\n\nThe drone hit at around 3:10 a.m., blowing out windows and damaging cars throughout a coastal neighborhood of Tel Aviv and reverberating in nearby cities. The military said it had not determined if it exploded in the air or directly struck buildings.\n\nPeople thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war since October.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona, said he was shaken awake in the hotel he lives in. Nevi said the strike made him lose \"all trust in the army -- not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone is believed to have exploded, said he hopes the war ends soon, but he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said there was no damage to the U.S. Embassy or any of its staff members.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nAnalysts and Western intelligence services have long accused Iran of arming the group, a claim that Tehran denies. In recent years, U.S. naval forces have intercepted a number of ships packed with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and missile parts en route from Iran to Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The Houthis maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom, however many have little or no connection to the war.\n\nFriday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could rekindle fears about the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza expanding into a regionwide conflagration.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel, by signaling that it's near the end of its military operations in Rafah, could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 Israeli hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nIsrael remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael's air defense system has intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war, including Hamas rocket fire from Gaza. But officials caution they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided direct confrontations with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people in the territory, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About half remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"},

It was not immediately clear how the strike evaded Israel's air defenses or how Israel might respond. Israel's military said that they were increasing air patrols after the incident.\n\nThe Houthis have repeatedly launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the nine-month-long war, in sympathy with Hamas. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nThe group lauded the drone's ability to bypass Israel's air defenses and said they aim to reach deep into Israel in response to the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas militants, which is now in its ninth month.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIt comes as international mediators continue to hold out hope for a cease-fire agreement, pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nThe prospects a deal could improve as Israeli leaders signal their operation underway in Rafah is close to finished. However, fears of potential escalation resurfaced on Thursday after Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Thursday to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nLocal police in Tel Aviv said that the Friday blast sounded at around 3:10 a.m., reverberating to nearby cities and physically injuring at least 10 people. Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air.\n\n\"The force of the explosion caused damage that is not great but is spread over a large area. At the moment we don't know what the object was,\" Amar said.\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defense system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles. These systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. It was not known which, if any, system was deployed.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's arch enemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nFind more of AP's coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel.But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\nThe strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIt also came a day after Israel's far right national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Thursday, a move that threatened negotiations to end the 9 month old war in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli negotiators were in Cairo on Wednesday to press ahead with talks on a cease-fire and hostage release deal, as Israel and Hamas consider the latest proposal. In recent weeks, Israel has stepped up strikes in central Gaza, where many Palestinians have fled to escape fighting in other parts of the beleaguered territory.\n\nHamas' Oct 7 attack sparked the war when militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250. Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 38,600 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nTwo international courts have accused Israel of war crimes and genocide, charges Israel denies. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza. Israeli restrictions, fighting, and the breakdown of law and order have limited humanitarian aid efforts, causing widespread hunger and sparking fears of famine.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nPalestinian militant groups call on the PLO to rescind recognition of Israel. The militant Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad have called on the leadership of the Palestine liberation Organisation to withdraw its recognition of Israel in retaliation for a resolution approved by Israel's parliament rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nThe two groups made the announcement late Thursday following a meeting in the Gulf nation of Qatar between Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, Islamic Jihad chief Ziad Nakhaleh and his deputy Mohammed al-Hindi, according to a Hamas statement.\n\nThe two groups said the Palestinian people have the right to set up their own independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nHezbollah says it fired rockets at northern Israeli village Beirut - Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group said it fired a volley of rockets on a northern Israeli village Friday morning in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes the night before on south Lebanon that killed several Hezbollah members and wounded civilians.\n\nIn another attack, the group also said that it used for the first time a new rocket with heavy warhead to strike an Israeli army post in the disputed Kfar Chouba hills. Hezbollah said in a statement that the Wabel rocket, produced by the group in Lebanon, destroyed parts of the Rweisat al-Alam post and caused a fire inside it.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters fired a salvo of rockets on the northern Israeli village of Abirim for the first time since fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border began in early October.\n\nHezbollah began firing rockets shortly after Hamas' Oct 7 attack, saying it aimed to ease pressure on Gaza. Since then, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed over 450 people, mostly Hezbollah members but also around 90 civilians and non combatants. On the Israeli side, 21 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed.\n\nYemen's Houthi rebels claim drone strike that hit Tel Aviv Tel Aviv: Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone strike early Friday that hit part of central Tel Aviv near the US Embassy, killing one person and injuring 10.\n\nThe aerial strike rumbled through the streets causing shards of shrapnel to rain down and spreading shards of glass over a large radius. The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones could bypass Israel's aerial defense systems.

He's due to meet U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday and address Congress two days later.\n\nThe shekel fell slightly to head for a third day of losses, while the stock market was shut for the Israeli weekend and reopens on Sunday.\n\nThe explosion happened close to Tel Aviv's sea front and a U.S. embassy branch, according to Israeli emergency services. The Israeli military said no sirens were activated and declined to comment if the American facility was the intended target.\n\nThe man who was killed was around 50 and eight people were injured. The attack happened close to 3 a.m. local time.\n\nIsraeli media showed footage of a low flying drone coming into Tel Aviv from the west over the Mediterranean sea.\n\n\"An initial inquiry indicates that the explosion in Tel Aviv was caused by the falling of an aerial target,\" the Israeli military said.\n\nIt later said the drone was detected by its defense systems and it's investigating why it wasn't shot down. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel will look at reinforcing its air defenses in response to the attack.\n\nDrone warfare has exposed a vulnerability in Israel's vaunted air defenses. The Iron Dome system -- which uses interceptors against incoming short-range missiles -- has effective against large objects fired by Hamas from Gaza and Hezbollah from Lebanon in recent months. But many smaller drones have been able to slip through.\n\nDozens of drones, primarily those sent by Hezbollah, have evaded the military's defenses and caused casualties and damage in Israel. The army is testing a laser-based system designed for small projectiles, though it won't be ready before 2025.\n\nThe Houthis started targeting Israel with drones and missiles shortly after the war in Gaza started. But, at least until now, none of their attacks are thought to have caused significant damage in Israel, with most projectiles being intercepted or failing to reach the country, which lies around 1,900 kilometers (1,180 miles) from Yemen.\n\nIsrael's largely avoided direct retaliation against the Islamist group.\n\nThe Houthis have caused havoc in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November, attacking commercial and military ships and forcing most Western-linked vessels to avoid the area. They've stepped up those naval assaults in the past six weeks.\n\nThe group says it's acting in solidarity with Palestinians and will continue their attacks until there's a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nIt is, along with Hamas and Hezbollah, part of Iran's \"axis of resistance\" -- anti-U.S. and anti-Israel militias in the Middle East that receive training and funding from Tehran.\n\nSince Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza, several of those groups have targeted Israel, U.S. bases in region or Western commercial interests.\n\nThe likes of the U.S., European Union and India have moved warships to the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in an attempt to thwart the Houthi shipping attacks. The U.S. and U.K. have also been striking Houthi positions in Yemen regularly since January. They say those have degraded the group's military capabilities, though it's still able to hit vessels and Iran continues to resupply it.\n\nBezalel Smotrich, Israel's far-right finance minister, said the drone strike on Tel Aviv showed the government has to continue the war in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed.\n\n\"In a region where only strength and power are understood, we do not have the privilege of ending the war without a complete victory in all arenas and the removal of the threat posed by them,\" he said on X.\n\n-------\n\n(With assistance from Patrick Sykes and Paul Abelsky.)", "source":

Most have failed even to reach Israel's southernmost city, Eilat, on the Red Sea some 270 kilometers (160 miles) south of Tel Aviv.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was investigating what went wrong. Chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the drone was detected by air defenses, but an \"error\" occurred and \"there was no interception.\"\n\n\"We are investigating the entire chain,\" he said. Another military official blamed \"human error.\" The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.\n\nThe spokesman for the Houthis, Yahya Sare'e, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement published on the social media platform X. He said it was in retaliation for the Israel-Hamas war and had hit one of the group's many targets.\n\nIsrael's military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.\n\nThe drone hit at around 3:10 a.m., blowing out windows and damaging cars throughout a coastal neighborhood of Tel Aviv and reverberating as far as nearby cities. The military said it had not determined if it exploded in the air or directly struck buildings.\n\nFootage verified by the AP shows the low-flying drone arriving at Tel Aviv's shoreline and then heading into the city, moments before an explosion lights up the night sky.\n\nIn one building, the Sajiv family swept up the shattered glass of their apartment's balcony door. Limor Sajiv said they were woken by the sound of a blast. \"We had no idea what it was. I mean, we heard missiles before we heard things, this was different, really, really loud,\" he said.\n\nPeople thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with the military's handling of the war since October.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona, said he was shaken awake in the hotel he lives in. Hearing it was human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone is believed to have exploded, said he hopes the war ends soon, but he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said there was no damage to the U.S. Embassy or any of its staff members.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Hezbollah.\n\nThe attack also comes days before Netanyahu is to travel to Washington and address Congress.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nAnalysts and Western intelligence services have long accused Iran of arming the group, a claim that Tehran denies. In recent years, U.S. naval forces have intercepted a number of ships packed with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and missile parts en route from Iran to Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.\n\nThe Houthis maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom. However, many have little or no connection to the war.\n\nFriday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza becoming a regionwide conflagration.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah is nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 Israeli hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nIsrael remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael's air defense system has intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war, including Hamas rocket fire from Gaza. But officials warn the systems are not 100% effective and appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided direct confrontations with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.\n\n___\n\nMetz reported from Rabat, Morocco.

However, a spokesperson for Israel's military said on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\" The military's assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such strikes for months.\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted to kill civilians in Israel,\" the Israeli spokesperson said.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon.\n\nIsrael has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIt comes as international mediators continue to hold out hope for a cease-fire agreement, pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nThe prospects a deal could improve as Israeli leaders signal their operation underway in Rafah is close to finished. However, fears of potential escalation resurfaced on Thursday after Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Thursday to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nLocal police in Tel Aviv said that the Friday blast sounded at around 3:10 am, reverberating to nearby cities and physically injuring at least 10 people. Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air.\n\n\"The force of the explosion caused damage that is not great but is spread over a large area. At the moment we don't know what the object was,\" Amar said.\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defense system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles.\n\nThese systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100 per cent effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. It was not known which, if any, system was deployed.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's arch enemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' October 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage.

If they are confirmed to be behind the attack, it would mark the first time they have successfully targeted Tel Aviv. They have previously fired missiles and drones at the southern port of Eilat, but have caused little damage as most of the projectiles have been destroyed by Israeli defence systems.\n\nThey have also launched multiple attacks against shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, severely disrupting the flow of goods through one of the world's key maritime trade routes.\n\nThe Israeli police said one man had been found dead in his apartment near the scene of the blast with shrapnel wounds, while a further 10 people with minor injuries had been evacuated for medical treatment.\n\n\"This is an event with an explosive that's relatively big.

Most have failed even to reach Israel's southernmost city, Eilat, on the Red Sea some 270 kilometers (160 miles) south of Tel Aviv.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was investigating what went wrong. Chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the drone was detected by air defenses, but an \"error\" occurred and \"there was no interception.\"\n\n\"We are investigating the entire chain,\" he said. Another military official blamed \"human error.\" The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.\n\nThe spokesman for the Houthis, Yahya Sare'e, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement published on the social media platform X. He said it was in retaliation for the Israel-Hamas war and had hit one of the group's many targets.\n\nIsrael's military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.\n\nThe drone hit at around 3:10 a.m., blowing out windows and damaging cars throughout a coastal neighborhood of Tel Aviv and reverberating as far as nearby cities. The military said it had not determined if it exploded in the air or directly struck buildings.\n\nIn one building, the Sajiv family swept up the shattered glass of their apartment's balcony door. Limor Sajiv said they were woken by the sound of a blast. \"We had no idea what it was. I mean, we heard missiles before we heard things, this was different, really, really loud,\" he said.\n\nPeople thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war since October.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona, said he was shaken awake in the hotel he lives in. Hearing it was human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone is believed to have exploded, said he hopes the war ends soon, but he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said there was no damage to the U.S. Embassy or any of its staff members.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nAnalysts and Western intelligence services have long accused Iran of arming the group, a claim that Tehran denies. In recent years, U.S. naval forces have intercepted a number of ships packed with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and missile parts en route from Iran to Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The Houthis maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom, however many have little or no connection to the war.\n\nFriday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas expanding into a regionwide conflagration.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah is nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 Israeli hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nIsrael remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael's air defense system has intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war, including Hamas rocket firre from Gaza. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided direct confrontations with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily

For instance, Iran launched hundreds of drones targeting Israel on the evening of April 13. The Houthis in Yemen have been bragging for months about extending the range of their drones to reach the Mediterranean.\n\nCasualties and damage reported\n\nOne person was killed and ten injured in the suspected drone attack on Tel Aviv, which occurred around 3 a.m. on Friday. There is damage as well. Pro-Iranian media has been discussing the incident, and Al-Mayadeen said that the attack was a \"Yemeni drone explosion on a Tel Aviv building.\" The report noted that \"A large drone penetrated the airspace of occupied Palestine at a low altitude from the sea and exploded in the city of Tel Aviv, causing significant damage to buildings and a number of injuries.\"\n\nThis represents a significant threat to Israel and will give the Iranian proxies in the region a reason to feel they have accomplished a new success in their war efforts. Tel Aviv is a primary and symbolic target. If they have reached it with drones, it represents another setback for Israel's deterrence and air superiority in the region. Targeting Tel Aviv has been a theme for Israel's enemies stretching back to the 1948 War of Independence. Saddam Hussein also targeted Tel Aviv with Scud missiles in 1991.\n\nDetails of the drone strike:\n\nHezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen claimed the drone struck an area near Shalom Aleichem Street in Tel Aviv, \"causing significant damage as a result of its collision with a building.\" Footage posted online includes the humming of what appears to be a drone engine before a large explosion.\n\nThe fact that sirens were not activated is a worrying reality. If the drone reached Israel directly from Yemen, that, too, would be a severe cause for concern. If the drone approached from the sea, it would also illustrate that the Houthis, or whoever launched the drone, have new unpredictable long-range capabilities. However, even if the Houthis claim the attack as their own, it doesn't necessarily mean they carried it out. The Iranian-backed rebels have claimed attacks on Saudi Arabia in the past that were carried out by Iran or Kataib Hezbollah in Iraq.\n\nThis means the Iranian axis works closely together and has been doing so for the last decade. These groups work together on drone technology as well. Hezbollah, for instance, claimed it had recently acquired the Shahed 101 drone, which operates with an electric engine and can fly long distances. It is relatively quiet compared to other drones, and Hezbollah claims it is difficult to detect with radar. Other drones used by Israel's adversaries include the Ababil T and Samad 2 drones, and many of these are built according to Iranian designs.\n\nThe new drone war on Israel\n\nThe new drone war on Israel is waged on multiple fronts by the Iranian-backed axis of proxies and militias. This includes Hezbollah, the Houthis, and militias in Iraq. They have access to similar types of drones of varying sizes and ranges. Recent reports by Iranian-backed media have included claims that the Iraqi militias and Houthis work together to coordinate attacks on Israel. Kataib Hezbollah in Iraq recently released a statement threatening Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the US. In addition, an Iranian-backed group attacked US forces at Asad base in Iraq using drones this week. Hezbollah claimed it carried out drone attacks on July 18 as well.\n\nAl-Mayadeen said the drone attack has caused \"panic\" in Israel. And it claimed that \"settlers\" in the city ran for cover. Iran views all Israelis as \"settlers\" in this context. Scenes were circulated, showing the moments of the explosion and its aftermath and the sound of the drone's engine before it hit the building. Israeli media also reported that \"more than one drone targeted the area.\" Pro-Iran media is watching Israel's response closely and will be pleased that Israel appears \"confused\" amid the attack.\n\nIDF statement on the attack\n\nThe IDF said, \"An initial inquiry indicates that the falling of an aerial target caused the explosion in Tel Aviv, and no sirens were activated. The incident is under thorough review. Israeli security forces are currently operating at the scene. The IAF has since increased its air patrols to protect Israeli airspace. There is no change in the defensive guidelines of the Home Front Command.\"\n\nThe alleged drone attack once again shows that Israel has let its deterrence slip in over nine months of war. While Israel is achieving tactical success in Gaza, it risks an overall strategic setback. The Iranian-backed axis seeks to attack Israel from multiple fronts to try to make up for the losses of Hamas in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem

(AP Photo/Oded Balilty)\n\nAn Iranian-made drone sent by Yemen's Houthi rebels struck Tel Aviv on Friday, leaving one person dead and at least 10 wounded in the group's first lethal strike into Israel.\n\nThe aerial strike -- the first lethal Houthi attack in Israel -- rumbled through the center of the city near the U.S. Embassy, causing shrapnel to rain down and spreading shards of glass over a large radius.\n\n\"We are holding an investigation today and in the coming days to understand exactly from where the threat was fired and what are the needed responses to defend the country and what are the attacking responses against who is threatening the state of Israel,\" said Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for Israel's military.\n\nThe Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the country's war with Hamas. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement published on the social media platform X. He said it was in retaliation for the Israel-Hamas war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nIsrael's military said it believed the drone -- an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances -- had traveled from Yemen, but rebuffed the Houthis? claim that their arsenal was capable of bypassing Israel's aerial defenses.\n\nAn Israeli military official said the explosive-laden drone was identified on Thursday but penetrated Israel because of \"human error\" in operating the system. The assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such attacks for months.\n\nThe Houthi strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv, hit at around 3:10 a.m. Local police said it reverberated to nearby cities and physically injured at least 10 people.\n\nIsrael's military said they had not determined whether the drone exploded in the air or directly struck buildings, but it blew out windows and damaged cars throughout the coastal neighborhood. People thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel, said the blast shook him awake to watch the aftermath from his balcony and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war.\n\nHearing it was human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone is believed to have exploded, said he hopes the war ends soon, but he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nAnalysts and Western intelligence services have long accused Iran of arming the group, a claim that Tehran denies. In recent years, U.S. naval forces have intercepted a number of ships packed with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and missile parts on route from Iran to Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The Houthis maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom, however many have little or no connection to the war.\n\nFriday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas expanding into a regionwide conflagration as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations. The country remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael's multilayered aerial defense system has intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. A military official said the system had identified the weapon but due to human error, was not set to alarm in case of attack.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided direct confrontations with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"},

Health authorities in Gaza and Israel said on Thursday that highly infectious polio has been detected in Gaza sewage samples.\n\n\"The humanitarian situation... is a moral stain on us all,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that, despite mounting pressure both at home and from abroad, there would be no let-up in Israel's campaign against Hamas.\n\nFar-right members of his governing coalition oppose a truce deal, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir who on Thursday said Netanyahu must not make a \"surrender\" accord with Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu is set to address the US Congress next Wednesday.\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden was expected to meet with him, but it will depend on the US leader's recovery from Covid.\n\nAhead of Netanyahu's visit, Israeli lawmakers passed a symbolic resolution opposing the creation of a Palestinian state -- a move criticised by the United Nations and one that clashes with US ambitions for the region.\n\nDespite the Israeli vote, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby reiterated \"our firm belief in the power and the promise of the two-state solution.\"", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al-Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare",

AP\n\nThe aerial strike rumbled through the streets causing shards of shrapnel to rain down and spreading shards of glass over a large radius.\n\nThe Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israeli war on Gaza, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel.\n\nBut until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\" The military's assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such strikes for months.\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted to kill civilians in Israel,\" the official said of the strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv in months.\n\nLocal police said the blast sounded at around 3:10 a.m., reverberating to nearby cities and physically injuring at least 10 people. Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air, however Israel's military said they had not determined whether the drone -- or pieces of it -- had struck buildings.\n\nIt blew out windows of a number of buildings and damaged cars in the neighborhood near the coastline. People thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead.\n\nMany of the roughly 60,000 Israelis evacuated from their homes earlier in the war have found housing in the area. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel in Tel Aviv said the blast shook him awake to watch the aftermath from his balcony and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war. He said many expected such a strike to come from the north, which the military said had not been the case.\n\nHearing it was a human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone exploded, said some of his items had fallen but there was no major damage. While he hopes the war ends soon, he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. They maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title":

Despite the explosion, air raid sirens were not activated, raising questions about the air defense system's response.\n\nThe incident came just hours after the military confirmed it had killed a senior Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon. An initial inquiry suggests the explosion was caused by an aerial target falling into the area. 'The incident is under thorough review,' the military stated, emphasizing the need for increased air patrols to secure Israeli airspace. However, no new civil defense measures have been ordered.\n\nMeanwhile, the military spokesman of Yemen's Houthi militants announced on social media platform X that they would soon reveal details about a military operation targeting Tel Aviv.

Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, told reporters that Israel's defense systems had apparently picked up the drone but failed to register it as a threat. No air-raid sirens were activated to warn civilians of the attack, despite Israel's extensive aerial defense system.\n\n\"We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,\" Admiral Hagari said.\n\nThe Israeli military said the drone had likely flown from Yemen, where the Houthis are based, before approaching Tel Aviv from the coast. Video posted on X and verified by The New York Times shows what appears to be a unmanned aerial vehicle approaching west of Tel Aviv, followed by a blast at the location of the strike.\n\nThe two sides offered differing accounts of the type of drone used in the attack.\n\nNasruddin Amer, a Houthi spokesman, said in an interview that the drone, called Yaffa, had been fully manufactured in Yemen and that it had not previously been used for direct operational purposes. He said the drone bore technologies that made it difficult to detect.\n\nBut Admiral Hagari told reporters that the drone was a Samad-3, an Iranian model, that had been adapted for long-distance flight. He denied that it had stealth capabilities that enabled it to evade Israeli surveillance.\n\nMr. Amer said that the attack was a response to \"an escalation in massacres against the Palestinian people in Gaza,\" and that the Houthis would halt their assaults only when the war in Gaza ends and Israel's blockade of the enclave is lifted. He added that Iran was not involved in the decision to carry out the attack on Tel Aviv, but he said the Houthis had updated the Iranians afterward.\n\nAsked whether Israel would respond to Friday's attack, Admiral Hagari said it would first work to fully assess the situation.\n\nIran-backed militants across the Middle East have fired masses of rockets and drones at Israel since Hamas's Oct. 7 attack triggered Israel's devastating campaign in Gaza. Israel has intercepted most of them, leaving central Israel mostly unscathed in recent months -- until Friday, when the explosive-laden drone struck the building just after 3 a.m.\n\nSince November, the Houthis have also been attacking ships along a vital route in the Red Sea in what they have described as a campaign in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Admiral Hagari said that dozens of drones had been launched at Israel from Yemen since the war with Hamas began in October, most of which were intercepted by American or Israeli forces.\n\nHezbollah, based in Lebanon, has launched thousands of strikes on northern Israel since the start of the war, many of which Israel's antimissile defenses have thwarted. Israel has also launched thousands of strikes on Lebanon in that period. Over 150,000 people have fled border towns in both countries, with little prospect of returning home.\n\nRon Huldai, the mayor of Tel Aviv, said the city was on heightened alert.\n\n\"The war is still here, and it is hard and painful,\" he said on social media, referring to Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blockade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stealth aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Huldai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron Huldai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Israels-military-says-its-investigating-why-it-missed-the-drone.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2163, "textEnd": 2169}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Yemen's Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attack that caused an explosion at a building near the U.S. embassy, which along with one dead, left at least a further 10 injured, according to reports.\n\nAn Israeli military official told a briefing that 'a very big drone that can travel long distances crashed into an apartment building' at 03.12am local time. The official, who remained anonymous, said the aim was 'terrorism', with the rebel group's 'main goal to kill civilians in Israel'. They added the drone was detected but the alarm was not immediately raised because of 'human error'. 'There was no alert that sounded in Tel Aviv because it wasn't activated.\n\n'There was a human error that caused the interception and defence systems not to be operated,' the official said. 'Obviously, one of the possibilities we're looking into is Yemen because of the Huthi announcements. But we're not ruling out anything.' The Israeli military said it had now opened an investigation into the large, and fatal, explosion near the U.S. embassy office and would work out why the country's air defence systems were not activated to intercept the 'aerial target' before any damage was caused.\n\nFollowing the drone strike, Israel's air force took to social media claiming it had increased patrols to 'protect the country's skies'. The official said another drone was detected on Israel's eastern border. 'Last night, there was another incident where we thwarted a UAV on our eastern border, another UAV.' He gave no details on where it came from.\n\nIsraeli police said the body of a 50-year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion site, and that the circumstances surrounding his death were also being investigated. Four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries and four others were treated for shock. All of them were later released, the hospital said, according to France24.\n\nA spokesperson for the Houthi armed forces said in a post on social media Friday that the Iran-aligned group had 'targeted Tel Aviv in occupied Palestine'. It claimed that it had used a new drone 'capable of bypassing interceptor systems and being able to be detected by radars'. Footage and images from the devastating scene in Tel Aviv show mangled vehicles, smashed windows, and rubble strewn across the streets as authorities worked to detect casualties and assess the damage caused by the blast.\n\nIsraeli opposition politician, and leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, Yair Lapid, said the attack was 'further proof that this government does not know and cannot give security to the citizens of Israel'. 'Those who lose deterrence in the north and south also lose it in the heart of Tel Aviv,' he wrote on X. 'There are no policies, no plans, all public relations and discussions about themselves. They [the government] have to go,' he continued.\n\nRecalling the terrifying attack, local resident Alon told Haaretz: 'The whole building shook'. 'My neighbours' windows shattered, so I was sure something had hit the building. It was only when I went outside that I realised that several buildings had been damaged.'\n\nThe incident came after the Israeli military confirmed it had killed a senior commander of the Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon on July 3. A Hezbollah statement at the time identified the killed commander as Mohammad Naameh Nasser, who went by the name Abu Naameh. A Hezbollah official speaking anonymously said he was head of the group's Aziz Unit, one of three regional divisions in southern Lebanon.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The IDF said the drone used in the attack was likely a Samad-3 modified with an extended range. The rare strike marked the Iran-backed rebels' first lethal attack inside Israel.\n\nThe Houthi-launched drone that struck a building in Israel on Friday, killing one person and injuring several more, appears to have been modified for extended-range strikes, the Israeli military said.\n\nThe Houthis claimed responsibility for the rare attack on Tel Aviv early Friday morning local time, which marked their first lethal attack in Israel. The Iran-backed rebels said that they carried out a \"specific military operation\" with a new attack drone that is undetectable by radars and can effectively sneak past air-defense systems.\n\nRear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesperson, said an initial assessment suggests the system used in the attack was an Iranian-made Samad-3 one-way attack drone with an extended range. He said the drone was launched from Yemen and crossed into Israeli territory from the direction of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nIn video footage from Friday's attack, the unmanned aircraft can be seen crossing over a beach in Tel Aviv and striking a building, causing a large explosion. The attack occurred near the US Embassy branch office, although it's unclear if that was the intended target. The resulting blast shattered windows and sent shrapnel falling into the streets.\n\nAccording to a February 2024 report by the US Defense Intelligence Agency, the Samad family of drones has a maximum range of just over 1,200 miles, which technically allows them to reach the bottom half of Israel.\n\nThe Houthis have launched dozens of drones from Yemen, although a majority have been intercepted before they could reach Israeli territory, Hagari said. He added that the IDF is investigating this latest incident to determine why the Samad-3 was not identified as a threat and shot down before it reached Tel Aviv.\n\n\"Today and in the coming days, we will conduct a situational assessment in order to examine the incident, understand exactly where the threat was launched from, what the necessary defensive responses are, and what the necessary operational responses are against those who threaten the State of Israel,\" Hagari said.\n\nLooking at the available information, Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank, said that \"it's possible\" that the drone used in the Tel Aviv attack is a \"slightly more capable\" Samad variant.\n\nHe wrote in commentary on social media that \"for the Houthis, increasing the UAV range would be quite attractive as it would allow them to strike targets further away, fly routes evading enemy defenses and attack from unexpected angles.\"\n\nThe Houthi said their drone strike was carried out in support of Palestinians in Gaza, the same rationale for their ongoing attacks on merchant shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The rebels have spent months launching one-way attack drones and anti-ship missiles into the waterways, often forcing US Navy and allied warships to intercept the threats.\n\nIsrael has yet to strike the Houthis directly in Yemen. The US and UK militaries, however, have carried out several rounds of joint strikes targeting rebel facilities there, and American forces have carried out a number of unilateral strikes.\n\nBeyond the Houthis, Iran also provides military and financial support to Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nFriday's attack took place hours after Israel killed a senior Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon and raises long-standing fears that the devastating Gaza war could escalate further into a broader regional conflict.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source":

The blast was heard in many areas across the central part of Israel.\n\nThe Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper's Telegram page posted videos showing the initial moments of the explosion.\n\nHebrew media speculated that a drone attack might have caused the explosion, though authorities have not confirmed this.\n\nA police spokesperson stated, \"A short while ago, a report was received at the police headquarters about an explosion heard in a building in Tel Aviv. Large police forces have arrived at the scene and are dealing with the incident.\"\n\nThe Israeli military said in a statement, \"Initial investigation indicates that the explosion in Tel Aviv was caused by the fall of an aerial object. No sirens were activated. The incident is under thorough investigation.\" The military added that it had increased aerial patrols to protect Israeli airspace but had not implemented new civil defense measures.\n\nHebrew media indicated that this was not a drone explosion and that no aerial infiltration into \"Israeli territory\" had been detected. The details remain under investigation.\n\nNews platforms circulated images and videos purportedly showing a drone wing at the explosion site. Israeli emergency services reported that several Israelis were injured by shrapnel from the massive explosion, with at least one person killed and ten others wounded.\n\nPolice have closed the area around the explosion and confirmed that forces are searching for debris to determine the cause of the blast before the Israeli military announced it was due to a drone explosion.\n\nIn a related context, Sky News Arabia's correspondent in Jerusalem reported the US military said it intercepted four drones on their way to Israel.\n\nAxios news site quoted a US official saying that the branch office of the US Embassy in Tel Aviv was undamaged, and no American citizens were injured, following reports that the building hit in the attack was near the US Embassy.\n\nLater on Friday morning, Yemen's Houthi group (Ansarallah) claimed that they targeted Tel Aviv with a drone, stating that the area would be a primary target within their weapons range.\n\nThe group's military spokesperson, Yahya Saree, said on X that the Yemeni Armed Forces' Air Force had conducted a significant operation with a new drone named \"Yafa,\" capable of \"bypassing enemy interception systems and undetectable by radars.\" He declared the operation a success.\n\nSaree added, \"The Yemeni Armed Forces declare the occupied area of Yafa an unsafe zone, and it will be a primary target for our weapons. We will focus on targeting the enemy's internal front and reaching deep into its territory.\" The statement emphasized that \"this exceptional operation confirms the Yemeni Armed Forces' possession of a target bank in occupied Palestine, including sensitive military and security targets,\" and vowed to continue striking those targets in response to the enemy's massacres and daily crimes against our brothers in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe group asserted that they would \"continue targeting Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians.\"\n\nThe Houthi group has been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea since the outbreak of the Gaza war between Israel and Hamas. They claim their attacks target ships loyal to or bound for Israel, though many of the vessels they have attempted to have no connection to Israel.", "source": {"uri": "shafaq.com", "dataType":

Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for Israel's military.\n\nThe Houthis have disrupted commercial shipping and launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the country's war with Hamas. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement published on the social media platform X. He said it was in retaliation for the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nIsrael's military said it believed the drone -- an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances -- had travelled from Yemen, but rebuffed the Houthis' claim that their arsenal was capable of bypassing Israel's aerial defences.\n\nAn Israeli military official said the explosive-laden drone was identified on Thursday, but penetrated Israel because of \"human error\" in operating the system. The assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such attacks for months.\n\nThe Houthi strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv, hit at around 3:10 a.m. local time. Local police said it reverberated to nearby cities and physically injured at least 10 people.\n\nIsrael's military said they had not determined whether the drone exploded in the air or directly struck buildings, but it blew out windows and damaged cars throughout the coastal neighborhood.\n\nFor many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months. Yossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel, said the blast shook him awake to watch the aftermath from his balcony and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war.\n\nHearing it was human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza with Hamas and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Analysts and Western intelligence services have long accused Iran of arming the group, a claim that Tehran denies.\n\nFriday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas expanding into a region-wide conflagration as international mediators continue to push for a ceasefire.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nThe October attack in Israel killed 1,200 people, including several Canadian citizens. Militants took about 250 people hostage then, with about 120 remaining in captivity, with about a third of those believed to be dead.

In recent weeks, Israel has stepped up strikes in central Gaza, where many Palestinians have fled to escape fighting in other parts of the beleaguered territory.\n\nHamas' Oct. 7 attack sparked the war when militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducting about 250. Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 38,600 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nTwo international courts have accused Israel of war crimes and genocide -- charges Israel denies. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza. Israeli restrictions, fighting and the breakdown of law and order have limited humanitarian aid efforts, causing widespread hunger and sparking fears of famine.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nBEIRUT -- The militant Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad have called on the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization to withdraw its recognition of Israel in retaliation for a resolution approved by Israel's parliament rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nThe two groups made the announcement late Thursday following a meeting in the Gulf nation of Qatar between Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Islamic Jihad chief Ziad Nakhaleh and his deputy Mohammed al-Hindi, according to a Hamas statement.\n\nThe two groups said the Palestinian people have the right to set up their own independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nBeirut -- Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group said it fired a volley of rockets on a northern Israeli village Friday morning in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes the night before on south Lebanon that killed several Hezbollah members and wounded civilians.\n\nIn another attack, the group also said that it used for the first time a new rocket with heavy warhead to strike an Israeli army post in the disputed Kfar Chouba hills. Hezbollah said in a statement that the Wabel rocket, produced by the group in Lebanon, destroyed parts of the Rweisat al-Alam post and caused a fire inside it.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters fired a salvo of rockets on the northern Israeli village of Abirim for the first time since fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border began in early October.\n\nHezbollah began firing rockets shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it aimed to ease pressure on Gaza. Since then, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed over 450 people, mostly Hezbollah members but also around 90 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 21 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed.\n\nTel Aviv -- Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone strike early Friday that hit part of central Tel Aviv near the U.S. Embassy, killing one person and injuring 10.\n\nThe aerial strike rumbled through the streets causing shards of shrapnel to rain down and spreading shards of glass over a large radius. The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted to kill civilians in Israel,\" the official said of the strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv in months.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"},

It said air patrols had been stepped up.\n\nThe Huthis, who have carried out dozens of attacks against Red Sea shipping to show support for Palestinians during the Gaza war, said their \"UAV force\" attacked \"one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv.\"\n\nThe rebels last Saturday had said they would \"not hesitate to expand its military operations... until the aggression stops\".\n\nIf an attack is confirmed, it would be the first to cause casualties in Tel Aviv since a rocket strike launched from Gaza wounded one person on May 26. Hundreds of rockets were fired at Tel Aviv in the October 7 attacks that set off the war, but most were intercepted.\n\nIsraeli police said they received hundreds of reports around 3:00 am (0000 GMT) of \"a strong explosion\".\n\nThe blast hit a building in a street near an annex of the US embassy in Israel, according to an AFP journalist, who saw broken windows.\n\nDuring the search, a man in his fifties was \"found dead in his apartment\" bearing injuries caused by shrapnel, police said.\n\nThe Magen David Adom emergency medical service said in a statement that it treated a man and a woman injured in their home, and two others hurt in the street. All four were taken to hospital with \"relatively minor\" injuries, it said.\n\n\"It may have been an aerial explosion... We were very lucky,\" said Peretz Amar, the Tel Aviv police commander, adding that \"the investigation is ongoing\".\n\n- 'Everything shook' -\n\nA Tel Aviv resident told AFP that he was awakened by the explosion and \"everything shook\".\n\nPolice called on residents to \"respect safety instructions and not to approach or touch debris or shrapnel that may contain explosives\".\n\nThe fire brigade said it was possible that a drone had caused the explosion.\n\nThe war in Gaza began with the October 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's military retaliation has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry.\n\nbur/mj/tw/it\n\nMore from this section\n\n[NEW]

The Iran-backed group claims the drone, called 'Yafa,' can evade interception systems. This is the first attack to penetrate Israel's defenses, despite previous Huthi claims on Israeli cities. Israel attributes the attack to a large, long-distance drone, possibly Iranian-made. The Gaza war, ongoing since October 7, has seen severe casualties and humanitarian crises, with Israeli retaliation resulting in significant civilian deaths.A drone claimed by Yemen's Huthi rebels slipped through Israel's vaunted air defence system on Friday to hit a Tel Aviv building near a US embassy annex, killing a civilian.\n\nThe Huthis fired at Tel Aviv a \"new drone called 'Yafa', which is capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems,\" said Yahya Saree, the Iran-backed Yemeni movement's spokesman.\n\nThe Huthis have targeted shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden with numerous drone and missile attacks since November, citing solidarity with Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThey have previously claimed attacks on Israeli cities including Ashdod, Haifa and Eilat, but Friday's strike appears to be the first to breach Israel's intricate air defences.\n\nIt comes after they threatened an escalation.\n\nAn Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a \"very big drone that can travel long distances\" was used in the attack which killed one person and occurred at 3:12 am (0012 GMT).\n\nThe drone was detected, the official said, but due to \"human error\" the alarm was not raised in time, and it slammed into an apartment building.\n\nMilitary spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israel believed the drone the drone used was Iranian-made and upgraded so that it could reach Tel Aviv from Yemen -- at least 1,800 kilometres (1,100 miles) away.\n\nIt was \"likely a Samad-3 model, which we estimate was launched from Yemen and reached Tel Aviv,\" he said, adding the impact killed one civilian and lightly injured others.\n\nEmergency medical services said four people were taken to hospital with \"relatively minor\" injuries.\n\nEverything blew out\n\nIn grainy security camera footage, the buzz of what appeared to be the drone was followed by an explosion that shook the building and set off car alarms.\n\nThe blast occurred about 100 metres (yards) from a US embassy annex, said an AFP journalist who saw broken windows along the street lined with apartment blocks.\n\n\"It woke me up because the vibration of the sound was like a 747 coming in,\" said Kenneth Davis, an Israeli who was staying in a hotel opposite the struck building.\n\n\"And then the explosion... everything blew out in the room, the windows and things from the ceiling, and it was on me, nothing heavy, but lots of pieces of stuff,\" he told AFPTV.\n\nHagari said Israel \"intercepted another UAV trying to infiltrate from the east\" at around the same time as the Tel Aviv attack.\n\n\"We are investigating why the UAV was not identified as a threat and intercepted before it struck,\" he said. \"I want to emphasise that (Israel's air) defence is not impenetrable.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, has claimed drone strikes against targets in Israel, labelling many of them \"joint operations\" with the Huthis.\n\nThe Gaza war began with the October 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's military retaliation has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, where fighting raged on Friday.\n\nMoral stain\n\nResidents said clashes were heard between Palestinian fighters and the Israeli army, with explosions and shelling in the Tal al-Hawa district of Gaza City.\n\nThe war has destroyed much of Gaza's housing and other infrastructure, leaving almost all the population displaced, short of food and drinking water.\n\nMany are living in unsanitary conditions. Health authorities in Gaza and Israel said on Thursday that highly infectious polio has been detected in Gaza sewage samples.\n\n\"The humanitarian situation... is a moral stain on us all,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that, despite mounting pressure both at home and from abroad, there would be no let-up in Israel's campaign against Hamas.\n\nFar-right members of his governing coalition oppose a truce deal, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir who on Thursday said Netanyahu must not make a \"surrender\" accord with Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu is set to address the US Congress next Wednesday.\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden was expected to meet with him, but it will depend on the US leader's recovery from Covid.\n\nAhead of Netanyahu's visit, Israeli lawmakers passed a symbolic resolution opposing the creation of a Palestinian state -- a move criticised by the United Nations and one that clashes with US ambitions for the region.\n\nDespite the Israeli vote, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby reiterated \"our firm belief in the power and the promise of the two-state solution.\"", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Authorities said the explosion was caused by an \"aerial target\".\n\nThe blast left at least one person dead, an Israeli emergency services representative said. A police report said seven people were injured.\n\n\"No sirens were activated,\" the army said in a statement, adding that the air force increased patrols \"to protect Israeli airspace\".\n\nThe blast occurred about 100 metres from the US embassy branch office compound, CNN analysis of open-source satellite imagery of the scene found. It was not immediately clear whether the American mission was the target of the attack.\n\nThe Houthis will continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war, a military spokesman for the Yemeni group said. Yemen is about 2,300km from Israel.\n\n\"The Yemeni armed forces air force, with the help of God almighty, carried out a qualitative military operation, which consisted of targeting one of the important targets in the occupied Yafa region, known as Tel Aviv,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"The operation was carried out with a new drone called Yafa, which is capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems and [is] unable to be detected by radars. The operation achieved its goals successfully.\"\n\nTel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai said on X that the city was on \"high alert\" after the drone attack and told residents to follow emergency instructions. \"The war is still here, and it is hard and painful,\" he said.\n\nThe attack came after a series of Israeli strikes destroyed a three-storey building in southern Lebanon on Thursday night and killed a commander in Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces.\n\nHezbollah and the Houthis are part of the Iran-backed network of militant groups in the Middle East, and have both attacked Israeli targets since the war in Gaza broke out on October 7.\n\nPalestinian Islamic Jihad commander Haitham Abu Al Ghazlan told Houthi-run Al Masirah that the attack is a \"qualitative and important development in the battle with the Israeli enemy\".", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement",

The site itself is thought to be close to a number of hotels, many hosting those displaced from Israel's northern border with Lebanon. A US embassy office is also close to the site of the attack.\n\n\"An initial inquiry indicates that the explosion in Tel Aviv was caused by the falling of an aerial target, and no sirens were activated. The incident is under thorough review,\" the Israeli military said in a statement, attributing its inability to detect the drone to human error rather than a system failure.\n\nThe Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a video released on Friday evening, that the aircraft had hit an apartment building. He said the drone was a Samad-3, an Iranian manufactured craft that had been modified to extend its range. Iran has not commented on the attack, or on the Israeli allegation, yet.\n\nAccording to Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree, the aircraft was a new type of drone, named \"Jaffa\" that was capable of flying undetected through Israel's extensive air defence systems.\n\nDespite being just 80km (50 miles) from Gaza, Tel Aviv has been almost untouched by the carnage unfolding within the enclave since October. More than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed Israel's relentless war on Gaza.\n\nThe drone strike within Tel Aviv, the centre for much of Israel's diplomatic functions, points to the growing reach of the Houthi arsenal, say analysts.\n\nThe Houthi group has made extensive use of drones throughout its latest campaign. However, almost all the missiles and drones launched against Israel have been intercepted. None are known to have reached Tel Aviv.\n\n\"The Houthis have claimed many attacks on Israel before, but there's little evidence to indicate most of those came anywhere close to hitting, and certainly not kill and injure like this one,\" independent Yemen analyst Nick Brumfield told Al Jazeera. \"Notably, this is the first publicly confirmed Houthi strike in the Mediterranean rather than the Red Sea or Gulf of Aden.\" Along these vital maritime routes, the Houthi have targeted numerous ships that they say have links to Israel.\n\nIn addition, \"they've been claiming strikes on Haifa in cooperation with Iran-backed groups in Iraq, but until now those mostly seemed like grandstanding,\" said Brumfield. \"This is big.\"\n\nNot really. The Houthis have made extensive use of drone warfare, including both aerial and water-bound craft, for some time.\n\nHouthi drones have also been a frequent target for western strikes, with the United Kingdom, France and the United States military all reporting destroying unmanned targets ahead of their possible hostile use.\n\n\"I believe last night's attack is part of the Houthi continuous escalation,\" Maysaa Shuja al-Deen of the Yemen-based Sana'a Center for Strategic Studies said, suggesting that repeat incidents of Houthi drones reaching distant targets was going to become more common. \"What's interesting is the target and the long range,\" she told Al Jazeera.\n\nIn the short term, it's unlikely.\n\nSince April's standoff between Iran and Israel, the two nations and their allies have shown themselves to be acutely aware of the risks of Israel's war on Gaza engulfing the wider Middle East.\n\nNevertheless, Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has already threatened revenge. In addition to strengthening the country's defence systems, he said he would \"settle the score with anyone who harms the State of Israel or directs terror against it\".\n\n\"Israel will in all likelihood feel compelled to do something since a person was killed,\" Brumfield said, referring to past instances of isolated though unclaimed Israeli strikes in Yemen. \"You could see Israel doing something like that now.\"\n\nIt's hard to say if Israel will launch \"more severe retaliations, like assassinations of Houthi commanders like what we've seen the Israelis do with Hezbollah in Lebanon\" he said. That's because of \"the unclear status of Israeli intelligence capability in Yemen,\" Brumfield said.\n\nThe Houthi's are known to be allied with Iran. However, this doesn't mean Iran ordered last night's strike.\n\nNevertheless, few doubt that Tehran's support of the group extends to weapons and their components.\n\nHowever, how precise Tehran's control is over a rebel group that has proven itself consistently unpredictable is at best uncertain.\n\n\"Iran for a long time has had this strategy of enabling non-state allies to build their own missiles. There are strong indications also with the Houthis they quite likely have domestic production capability,\" Fabian Hinz of the International Institute for Strategic Studies said.", "source": {"uri":

Saddam Hussein also targeted Tel Aviv with Scud missiles in 1991.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBN.com - The Christian Broadcasting Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(weaponry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fragmentation (weaponry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consulate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consulate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scud_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scud missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Jerusalem Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saddam Hussein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www2.cbn.com/sites/default/files/media/slider/images/ap24201143497590.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Most have failed even to reach Israel's southernmost city, Eilat, on the Red Sea some 270 kilometers (160 miles) south of Tel Aviv.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was investigating what went wrong. Chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the drone was detected by air defenses, but an \"error\" occurred and \"there was no interception.\"\n\n\"We are investigating the entire chain,\" he said. Another military official blamed \"human error.\" The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.\n\nRelated Story: Yemen's Houthi Rebels Unveil Solid-Fuel 'Palestine' Missile ...\n\nThe spokesman for the Houthis, Yahya Sare'e, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement published on the social media platform X. He said it was in retaliation for the Israel-Hamas war and had hit one of the group's many targets.\n\nIsrael's military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.\n\nThe drone hit at around 3:10 a.m., blowing out windows and damaging cars throughout a coastal neighborhood of Tel Aviv and reverberating as far as nearby cities. The military said it had not determined if it exploded in the air or directly struck buildings.\n\nFootage verified by the AP shows the low-flying drone arriving at Tel Aviv's shoreline and then heading into the city, moments before an explosion lights up the night sky.\n\nIn one building, the Sajiv family swept up the shattered glass of their apartment's balcony door. Limor Sajiv said they were woken by the sound of a blast. \"We had no idea what it was. I mean, we heard missiles before we heard things, this was different, really, really loud,\" he said.\n\nRelated Story: US and Britain Strike Houthi Rebel Targets in Yemen After Surge in Shipping ...\n\nPeople thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with the military's handling of the war since October.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona, said he was shaken awake in the hotel he lives in. Hearing it was human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone is believed to have exploded, said he hopes the war ends soon, but he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said there was no damage to the U.S. Embassy or any of its staff members.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Hezbollah.\n\nThe attack also comes days before Netanyahu is to travel to Washington and address Congress.\n\nRelated Story: Missile Attacks Damage a Ship in the Red Sea Off Yemen's Coast Near ...\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nAnalysts and Western intelligence services have long accused Iran of arming the group, a claim that Tehran denies. In recent years, U.S. naval forces have intercepted a number of ships packed with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and missile parts en route from Iran to Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.\n\nThe Houthis maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom. However, many have little or no connection to the war.\n\nFriday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza becoming a regionwide conflagration.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah is nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 Israeli hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nIsrael remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nRelated Story: Yemen's Houthi Rebels Unveil Solid-Fuel 'Palestine' Missile ...\n\nIsrael's air defense system has intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war, including Hamas rocket fire from Gaza. But officials warn the systems are not 100% effective and appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided direct confrontations with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors":

He said it was in retaliation for the Israel-Hamas war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nIsrael's military said it believed the drone -- an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances -- had traveled from Yemen, but rebuffed the Houthis' claim that their arsenal was capable of bypassing Israel's aerial defenses.\n\nAn Israeli military official said the explosive-laden drone was identified on Thursday but penetrated Israel because of \"human error\" in operating the system. The assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such attacks for months.\n\nThe Houthi strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv, hit at around 3:10 a.m. Local police said it reverberated to nearby cities and physically injured at least 10 people.\n\nIsrael's military said they had not determined whether the drone exploded in the air or directly struck buildings, but it blew out windows and damaged cars throughout the coastal neighborhood. People thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel, said the blast shook him awake to watch the aftermath from his balcony and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war.\n\nHearing it was human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone is believed to have exploded, said he hopes the war ends soon, but he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nAnalysts and Western intelligence services have long accused Iran of arming the group, a claim that Tehran denies. In recent years, U.S. naval forces have intercepted a number of ships packed with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and missile parts on route from Iran to Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The Houthis maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom, however many have little or no connection to the war.\n\nFriday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas expanding into a regionwide conflagration as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations. The country remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael's multilayered aerial defense system has intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. A military official said the system had identified the weapon but due to human error, was not set to alarm in case of attack.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided direct confrontations with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"},

No alarms were activated in the attack, the Israeli military said earlier in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for the Houthi militia, Yahya Sarea, said in a televised statement that the group had targeted Tel Aviv and that it would continue to target the city. The militia, which is based in Yemen, used a new drone that can get past Israel's defense systems and is not detected by radar, he added.\n\nThe Israeli military official said it was possible that the country's defense systems had registered the drone but misidentified it. Because the drone was capable of traveling long distances, the military was not ruling out any possibilities and was looking into whether it had been launched from Yemen, the official said, adding that no more attacks were thought to be headed toward Israel.\n\nSince November, the Houthis have been attacking ships in a vital route in the Red Sea in a campaign in support of Palestinians. The military official said that dozens of drones had been launched at Israel since the war with Hamas began in October.\n\nHezbollah, based in Lebanon, has launched thousands of strikes on northern Israel since the start of the war, some of which have been thwarted by the country's antimissile defenses. Israel has also launched thousands of strikes on Lebanon in that period. In both countries, tens of thousands of people have evacuated from areas near the border.\n\nTel Aviv is about 130 miles south of the border with Lebanon. The military official said that the drone that struck the city was not believed to have come from the north, but that nothing had been confirmed.\n\nRon Huldai, the mayor of Tel Aviv, said the city was on heightened alert.\n\n\"The war is still here, and it is hard and painful,\" he said on social media, referring to Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAsked whether Israel would respond to the attack, the military official said it would first work to fully assess the situation.\n\nThe body of a 50-year-old man was found in a nearby apartment building as emergency workers were combing through the area around the explosion, according to a statement from Zaki Heller, a spokesman for Israel's national emergency service. The man was found in his apartment and had shrapnel injuries, the Tel Aviv police said in a statement.\n\nThe police said 10 people had been wounded and described them as \"lightly injured.\" Four of them suffered penetrating and blunt force trauma, Roee Klein, a paramedic for the national emergency service, said in a video.\n\nWitnesses described a \"very loud explosion\" that could be heard miles away. Surveillance video widely circulated on social media and verified by Storyful shows a bright flash of light, followed by a boom and the sound of an alarm.\n\nThe police said that a large number of forces were responding to the explosion. The military said that security forces were at the scene and that the air force had increased patrols of Israeli air space.\n\nMatthew Mpoke Bigg, Aaron Boxerman and Ronen Bergman contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ephrat_livni@nytimes.com", "name": "Ephrat Livni", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronen_Bergman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronen Bergman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Huldai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron Huldai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(weaponry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fragmentation (weaponry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/19/multimedia/19xp-israel-qwpm/19xp-israel-qwpm-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement published on the social media platform X. He said it was in retaliation for the Israel-Hamas war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nIsrael's military said it believed the drone -- an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances -- had traveled from Yemen, but rebuffed the Houthis' claim that their arsenal was capable of bypassing Israel's aerial defenses.\n\nAn Israeli military official said the explosive-laden drone was identified on Thursday but penetrated Israel because of \"human error\" in operating the system. The assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such attacks for months.\n\nThe Houthi strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv, hit at around 3:10 a.m. Local police said it reverberated to nearby cities and physically injured at least 10 people.\n\nIsrael's military said they had not determined whether the drone exploded in the air or directly struck buildings, but it blew out windows and damaged cars throughout the coastal neighborhood. People thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel, said the blast shook him awake to watch the aftermath from his balcony and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war.\n\nHearing it was human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone is believed to have exploded, said he hopes the war ends soon, but he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nAnalysts and Western intelligence services have long accused Iran of arming the group, a claim that Tehran denies. In recent years, U.S. naval forces have intercepted a number of ships packed with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and missile parts on route from Iran to Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The Houthis maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom, however many have little or no connection to the war.\n\nFriday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas expanding into a regionwide conflagration as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations. The country remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael's multilayered aerial defense system has intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. A military official said the system had identified the weapon but due to human error, was not set to alarm in case of attack.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided direct confrontations with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.", "source": {"uri": "kfdm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KFDM"}, "authors": [],

Israel's military said that they were increasing air patrols after the incident.\n\nThe Houthis have repeatedly launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the nine-month-long war, in sympathy with Hamas. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nThe group lauded the drone's ability to bypass Israel's air defenses and said they aim to reach deep into Israel in response to the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas militants, which is now in its ninth month.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIt comes as international mediators continue to hold out hope for a cease-fire agreement, pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nThe prospects a deal could improve as Israeli leaders signal their operation underway in Rafah is close to finished. However, fears of potential escalation resurfaced on Thursday after Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Thursday to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nLocal police in Tel Aviv said that the Friday blast sounded at around 3:10 a.m., reverberating to nearby cities and physically injuring at least 10 people. Tel Aviv District Commander Peretz Amar said officers could not locate the point of contact, suggesting the explosion occurred in the air.\n\n\"The force of the explosion caused damage that is not great but is spread over a large area. At the moment we don't know what the object was,\" Amar said.\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defense system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles. These systems have intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. It was not known which, if any, system was deployed.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's arch enemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nFind more of AP's coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war", "source":

Furthermore, Israeli defense systems were not activated, possibly due to human error. The official noted that defense systems had downed a UAV on its eastern border earlier that night.\n\nNotably, the Houthis claimed to possess a drone capable of reaching Tel Aviv (approximately 1,730 miles from Sana'a) and defeating defensive measures. \"The operation was carried out with a new drone called 'Yafa,' which is capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems and undetectable by radars,\" said the Houthi statement. While very little is known about the \"Yafa\" drone, respected analyst Fabian Hinz has detailed some possibilities regarding its specifications on X.\n\nThe attack on Tel Aviv should not come as a surprise, at least to analysts and Israeli intelligence. The Houthis have published claims throughout the nine-month war that they have attempted to hit targets on Israel's Mediterranean coast. However, no evidence to support their claims was ever published, leading to speculation that the assertions made by the group were exaggerated.\n\nUndoubtedly, the attack on Tel Aviv is a significant operation for the Houthis and its partners in the Iran-led \"Resistance Axis.\" Only a few actors in the Middle East have the capability to attack Tel Aviv with a drone. Furthermore, Israel has refrained from attacking the Houthis during the war in Gaza despite repeated attempts by the group to strike the Jewish state. Still, an attack on a major Israeli city that resulted in the death of a civilian and the wounding of others will likely compel Israel to respond.\n\nJoe Truzman is an editor and senior research analyst at FDD's Long War Journal focused primarily on Palestinian armed groups and non-state actors in the Middle East.", "source": {"uri": "longwarjournal.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "FDD's Long War Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_truzman@longwarjournal.org", "name": "Joe Truzman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaffa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jaffa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FDD's_Long_War_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FDD's Long War Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanaa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanaa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewish state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mossad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axis powers"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement published on the social media platform X. He said it was in retaliation for the Israel-Hamas war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nIsrael's military said it believed the drone -- an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances -- had traveled from Yemen, but rebuffed the Houthis' claim that their arsenal was capable of bypassing Israel's aerial defenses.\n\nAn Israeli military official said the explosive-laden drone was identified on Thursday but penetrated Israel because of \"human error\" in operating the system. The assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such attacks for months.\n\nThe Houthi strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv, hit at around 3:10 a.m. Local police said it reverberated to nearby cities and physically injured at least 10 people.\n\nIsrael's military said they had not determined whether the drone exploded in the air or directly struck buildings, but it blew out windows and damaged cars throughout the coastal neighborhood. People thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel, said the blast shook him awake to watch the aftermath from his balcony and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war.\n\nHearing it was human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone is believed to have exploded, said he hopes the war ends soon, but he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nAnalysts and Western intelligence services have long accused Iran of arming the group, a claim that Tehran denies. In recent years, U.S. naval forces have intercepted a number of ships packed with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and missile parts on route from Iran to Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The Houthis maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom, however many have little or no connection to the war.\n\nREAD MORE: As Gaza's doctors struggle to save lives, many lose their own in Israeli airstrikes\n\nFriday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas expanding into a regionwide conflagration as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations. The country remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael's multilayered aerial defense system has intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. A military official said the system had identified the weapon but due to human error, was not set to alarm in case of attack.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided direct confrontations with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nMetz reported from Rabat, Morocco.

He's due to meet US President Joe Biden and address Congress on July 24.\n\nThe explosion happened close to Tel Aviv's sea front and a US embassy branch, according to Israeli emergency services. The Israeli military said no sirens were activated and declined to comment if the American facility was the intended target.\n\nThe man who was killed was around 50 and eight people were injured. The attack happened close to 3 a.m. local time.\n\n\"An initial inquiry indicates that the explosion in Tel Aviv was caused by the falling of an aerial target,\" the Israeli military said.\n\nIt later added that the drone was detected and it's investigating why it wasn't shot down.\n\nThe Houthis started targeting Israel with drones and missiles shortly after the war in Gaza started. But, at least until now, none of their attacks are thought to have caused significant damage in Israel, with most being intercepted or failing to reach the country, which lies around 1,900 kilometers (1,180 miles) from Yemen.\n\nIsrael's largely avoided direct retaliation against the Houthis.\n\nDrone warfare has exposed a vulnerability in Israel's vaunted air defenses. The Iron Dome system -- which uses interceptors against incoming short-range missiles -- is effective against large objects, but many smaller drones are able to slip through.\n\nDozens of drones, primarily those fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon, have evaded the military's defenses this year and caused casualties and damage in Israel. The army is testing a laser-based system designed for small projectiles, though it won't be ready before 2025.\n\nThe Houthis have caused havoc in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November, attacking commercial and military ships and forcing most Western-linked vessels to avoid the area. They've stepped up those naval assaults in the past six weeks.\n\nThe Islamists say they're acting in solidarity with Palestinians and will continue their attacks until there's a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nThey are, along with Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon, part of Iran's \"axis of resistance\" -- anti-US and anti-Israel militias in the Middle East that receive training and funding from Tehran.\n\nSince Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza, several of those groups have targeted Israel, US bases in region or Western commercial interests.\n\nThe likes of the US, European Union and India have moved warships to the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in an attempt to thwart the Houthi shipping attacks. The US and UK have also been striking Houthi positions in Yemen regularly since January. They say those have degraded the group's military capabilities, though it's still able to hit vessels and Iran continues to resupply it.\n\nBezalel Smotrich, Israel's far-right finance minister, said the drone strike on Tel Aviv showed that the government has to continue the war in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed.\n\n\"In a region where only strength and power are understood, we do not have the privilege of ending the war without a complete victory in all arenas and the removal of the threat posed by them,\" he said on X.\n\n--With assistance from Patrick Sykes and Paul Abelsky.\n\nMost Read

The incident has been attributed to the Houthi movement, which describes it as a \"special operation.\"\n\nWitnesses in downtown Tel Aviv's popular Ben Yehuda Street claimed to have heard a big explosion. In addition to confirming the finding of a corpse with shrapnel wounds, Israeli police also said that three other people were hurt in the explosion.\n\nTo control the situation, a sizable police contingent from the Tel Aviv neighborhood quickly arrived on the scene. In order to determine the source of the explosion, authorities have cordoned off the area and are aggressively looking for shrapnel bits.\n\nThe explosion was determined by the Israeli military to be the consequence of a drone detonation. The inability of air defenses and air raid sirens to intercept the drone has prompted an official inquiry. Sirens were not triggered because, as the Israeli Home Front Command had earlier declared, there was no observed violation of airspace.\n\nThe Houthi military spokesperson, Yahya Saree, said on Friday morning that the air force of the group carried out a \"special operation\" in Tel Aviv with the aid of a brand-new \"Yafa\" drone. Tel Aviv is still a top target for the Houthis and is within range of their weaponry, according to Saree.\n\nThe Houthis have been attacking Israeli-affiliated ships in the Red Sea since November of last year, claiming to be in favor of Gaza. In order to confront these threats, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries formed a military alliance. They have also claimed credit for other strikes against Israeli targets.", "source": {"uri": "albawaba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Bawaba"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(weaponry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fragmentation (weaponry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense_siren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense siren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Front_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home Front Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaffa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jaffa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/default/public/2024-07/AFP__20240719__364K4W3__v3__HighRes__IsraelYemenPalestinianConflictExplosion.jpg?itok=c2lVYLDN", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It was detected but the alarm was not immediately raised because of \"human error,\" the official said.\n\n\"No sirens were activated,\" an army statement said, adding that the air force had \"increased its air patrols in order to protect Israeli airspace.\"\n\nThe Houthis' military spokesman said last Saturday that his group \"will not hesitate to expand its military operations... until the aggression stops.\"\n\nThe threat came after the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said at least 90 people were killed and 300 injured in a strike on Al-Mawasi camp for displaced people. Israel said the strike targeted Hamas military commanders behind the October 7 attack that sparked the Gaza war between Hamas and Israel.\n\nThe Houthis have previously alleged several attacks targeting the southern Israeli port city of Eilat on the Gulf of Aqaba, but Friday's strike is the first operation claimed by the rebels against Tel Aviv, deep inside Israel.\n\nThe rebels on Friday declared the Israeli commercial hub \"an unsafe area,\" saying it \"will be a primary target within the range of our weapons.\"\n\nSaree said the Houthis \"have a bank of targets\" in Israel, including \"sensitive military and security targets.\"\n\nThey \"will continue... to strike those targets in response to the enemy's massacres and daily crimes against our people in the Gaza Strip,\" Saree said.\n\nIn a separate incident on Friday, projectiles struck a container ship off the coast of Yemen without causing any injuries, an attack likely carried out by the Houthis, maritime security firm Ambrey said.\n\n\"A Singapore-flagged container ship was 'hit' by projectiles\" 80 nautical miles (148 kilometers) southeast of the Yemeni port city of Aden, Ambrey said in an advisory, adding that no injuries were reported in the attack that is consistent with previous Houthi operations.\n\nBritish maritime security agency UKMTO also said a \"vessel has been hit by unknown projectiles\" southeast of Aden.\n\n\"All crew reported safe. Authorities are investigating,\" said the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which is run by Britain's Royal Navy.\n\nHouthi attacks have prompted some shipping companies to detour around southern Africa to avoid the Red Sea, a vital route that normally carries about 12 percent of global trade, according to the International Chamber of Shipping.\n\nEgypt's Suez Canal on Thursday reported a 23.4-percent drop in revenues attributed to disruptions in Red Sea shipping over the past year.", "source": {"uri": "thedefensepost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Defense Post"},

Medical services said four people suffered \"relatively minor\" injuries.\n\nDefence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed to avenge the drone attack.\n\n\"The security system will settle the score with all who try to harm the state of Israel, or sends terrorism against it, in a decisive and surprising manner,\" he said in comments posted on social media platform X.\n\n* 'Everything blew out' -\n\nIn grainy security camera footage, the buzz of what appeared to be the drone was followed by an explosion that shook the building and set off car alarms.\n\nThe blast occurred about 100 metres (300 feet) from a US embassy annexe, said an AFP journalist who saw broken windows along the street lined with apartment blocks.\n\n\"It woke me up because the vibration of the sound was like a 747 (jet) coming in,\" said Kenneth Davis, an Israeli who was staying in a hotel opposite the building which was hit.\n\n\"And then the explosion... everything blew out in the room,\" he told AFPTV.\n\nHagari said Israel \"intercepted another UAV trying to infiltrate from the east\" at around the same time as the Tel Aviv attack.\n\n\"We are investigating why the UAV was not identified as a threat and intercepted before it struck,\" he said.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, has claimed drone strikes against targets in Israel, labelling many of them \"joint operations\" with the Huthis.\n\nSince November, the Huthis have also carried out dozens of drone and missile attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden that they claim is Israeli-linked.\n\nThe United States and Britain launched a campaign of air strikes in January to deter the attacks on merchant vessels.\n\nThe Gaza war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 38,848 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory, where fighting raged on Friday.\n\n* WHO reports no polio cases -\n\nResidents said clashes were heard between Palestinian fighters and the Israeli army, with explosions and shelling in the Tal al-Hawa district of Gaza City.\n\nThe war has destroyed much of Gaza's housing and other infrastructure, leaving virtually the entire population displaced and short of food and drinking water.\n\nMany are living in unsanitary conditions.

Health authorities in Gaza and Israel said on Thursday that highly infectious polio has been detected in Gaza sewage samples.\n\n\"The humanitarian situation... is a moral stain on us all,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that, despite mounting pressure both at home and from abroad, there would be no let-up in Israel's campaign against Hamas.\n\nFar-right members of his governing coalition oppose a truce deal, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir who on Thursday said Netanyahu must not make a \"surrender\" accord with Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu is set to address the US Congress next Wednesday.\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden was expected to meet with him, but it will depend on the US leader's recovery from Covid.\n\nAhead of Netanyahu's visit, Israeli lawmakers passed a symbolic resolution opposing the creation of a Palestinian state -- a move criticised by the United Nations and one that clashes with US ambitions for the region.\n\nDespite the Israeli vote, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby reiterated \"our firm belief in the power and the promise of the two-state solution.\"\n\nburs-dv/it", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians",

The Israeli military has confirmed the attack and said it claimed the life of one citizen.\n\nIn a televised statement earlier on 19 July, Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree said the group's forces \"carried out a specific military operation\" that targeted \"the occupied Jafa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv\".\n\nA new drone called 'Yafa' was used, he said, which is capable of bypassing interception systems and is undetectable by radars. \"The operation has achieved its goals successfully,\" Saree said.\n\nIsrael's military confirmed a building in Tel Aviv was hit by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), causing one death and eight injuries.\n\n\"During the night, a UAV entered from the sea -- from the west -- which in our initial assessment was launched from Yemen,\" said Israeli Defence Force (IDF) spokesman brigadier general Daniel Hagari. He said IDF warning systems were not activated and the force is investigating the incident.\n\n\"According to the preliminary investigation and field indicators, it is clear that the drone was a 'Sammad 3' type, which departed from Yemen to Tel Aviv as per our estimates,\" he said. \"Sammad 3 is an Iranian combat vehicle that has been modernised for long range attacks.\"\n\nVideo footage posted on social media appear to show what could have been the impact of a drone a few hundred meters from the US embassy branch office in Tel Aviv.\n\nThis marks a significant escalation that might risk a regional spillover of the 10-month conflict between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas, especially with Israel highlighting the Iranian origin of the UAV. Israel and Iran avoided a full-blown war in April after a significant escalation led to exchanging direct aerial strikes against each other's territory.\n\nThe Houthis began attacking commercial ships in and around the Red Sea six weeks after the Israel-Hamas war broke out last year in what they claim is an act of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up their attacks on shipping in the past six weeks. It has repeatedly threatened to target Israel and its ports, but previous attempts have largely been intercepted or failed to reach the country.

The Iran-backed rebels said that they carried out a \"specific military operation\" with a new attack drone that is undetectable by radars and can effectively sneak past air-defense systems.\n\nRear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesperson, said an initial assessment suggests the system used in the attack was an Iranian-made Samad-3 one-way attack drone with an extended range. He said the drone was launched from Yemen and crossed into Israeli territory from the direction of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nIn video footage from Friday's attack, the unmanned aircraft can be seen crossing over a beach in Tel Aviv and striking a building, causing a large explosion. The attack occurred near the US Embassy branch office, although it's unclear if that was the intended target. The resulting blast shattered windows and sent shrapnel falling into the streets.\n\nAccording to a February 2024 report by the US Defense Intelligence Agency, the Samad family of drones has a maximum range of just over 1,200 miles, which technically allows them to reach the bottom half of Israel.\n\nThe Houthis have launched dozens of drones from Yemen, although a majority have been intercepted before they could reach Israeli territory, Hagari said. He added that the IDF is investigating this latest incident to determine why the Samad-3 was not identified as a threat and shot down before it reached Tel Aviv.\n\n\"Today and in the coming days, we will conduct a situational assessment in order to examine the incident, understand exactly where the threat was launched from, what the necessary defensive responses are, and what the necessary operational responses are against those who threaten the State of Israel,\" Hagari said.\n\nLooking at the available information, Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank, said that \"it's possible\" that the drone used in the Tel Aviv attack is a \"slightly more capable\" Samad variant.\n\nHe wrote in commentary on social media that \"for the Houthis, increasing the UAV range would be quite attractive as it would allow them to strike targets further away, fly routes evading enemy defenses and attack from unexpected angles.\"\n\nThe Houthi said their drone strike was carried out in support of Palestinians in Gaza, the same rationale for their ongoing attacks on merchant shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The rebels have spent months launching one-way attack drones and anti-ship missiles into the waterways, often forcing US Navy and allied warships to intercept the threats.\n\nIsrael has yet to strike the Houthis directly in Yemen. The US and UK militaries, however, have carried out several rounds of joint strikes targeting rebel facilities there, and American forces have carried out a number of unilateral strikes.\n\nBeyond the Houthis, Iran also provides military and financial support to Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nFriday's attack took place hours after Israel killed a senior Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon and raises long-standing fears that the devastating Gaza war could escalate further into a broader regional conflict.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Daniel Hagari, dismissed Houthi claims that the drone was a type of stealth aircraft and maintained it had been picked up by Israeli monitoring systems. A second drone targeting Israeli airspace was successfully intercepted early Friday, he said. Investigators were exploring whether the two attacks were related.\n\nThe drone that reached Tel Aviv was an Iranian-made Samad-3 that had been modified to fly greater distances, he said.\n\nThe Houthis, a Yemen-based group that has been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea since last year, said Friday in a statement that it had carried out a \"military operation\" targeting Tel Aviv that \"successfully achieved its objectives\", using what it said was a new drone capable of evading countermeasures. The attack, the statement said, was in response to Israeli \"massacres\" in Gaza.\n\nWitnesses said they heard and saw an aircraft appear from the direction of the Mediterranean Sea around 3am and slam into a building with a loud explosion. There were no warning alarms in a city where residents are used to air raid sirens and alerts on their phones sending them to shelters.\n\nLimor Sagiv, 58, was asleep with her partner in a fifth-floor apartment less than two blocks from the US Embassy facility when the blast shattered their kitchen window and a balcony door.\n\n\"There was an orange flash and a smell like a rubber fire,\" said Sagiv, standing in a living room filled with glass shards. They had just returned to the apartment after being told by police to evacuate the area for a few hours in case of secondary attacks.\n\nNoa Yehoshua was up late with friends in a nearby apartment when one of them spotted a small aircraft with a round fuselage and wide wings.\n\n\"My friend was sitting by the window and said, 'Oh, wow, guys, what it that?'\" Yehoshua said. \"And then it just exploded.\"\n\nYehoshua, 23, an army reservist scheduled to deploy to Gaza next week, said the drone strike was part of the wider war with Iran-backed forces throughout the region that has raged since the Hamas raid on Israeli towns on October 7.\n\n\"It's so surreal that we're attacked over and over and over again in a war that we didn't even start,\" she said.\n\nDuring the war in Gaza, the Houthis and other Iran-backed groups in the region have carried out regular attacks they say are aimed at supporting Palestinian militant groups and ending Israel's military offensive. The Yemeni group has previously claimed drone attacks on the southern Israeli city of Eilat - roughly 1000 miles (1600 kilometres) from northern Yemen - but the strike on Tel Aviv, if confirmed, appears to represent an increase in the Houthis' capabilities and reach.\n\nThe Yemeni group said it would continue to target Tel Aviv with future attacks.\n\n\"The security system is working to immediately strengthen all defence systems, and will come to account with anyone who harms the State of Israel or sends terror against it,\" Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement on Friday.\n\nThe fatality was a 50-year-old man who was found with severe shrapnel injuries in an apartment adjacent to the blast, said Roee Klein, a paramedic with Magen David Adom, Israel's national emergency service. The nearby Ichilov Medical Centre said Friday it had treated and released five people injured in the strike.\n\nIsraeli media identified the fatality as Yevgeny Ferder, a Belarusian immigrant who arrived in Israel two years ago at the beginning of Russia's war in Ukraine. He was killed in the hotel where he both lived and worked, according to the reports.\n\nFriday's rare attack on Tel Aviv took place hours after the Israeli air force said it killed two commanders of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group in Lebanon with which Israel has been exchanging fire. Hezbollah acknowledged the deaths of two of its members but did not identify them as senior operatives.\n\nIsrael's aerial defence system, outfitted primarily for rockets, has for months struggled to identify and eliminate Hezbollah drones - which fly lower and often in nonlinear paths - in attacks on Israel's north.\n\nFabian Hinz, a research fellow who studies drones and missiles at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said that pictures of the debris from the drone that circulated Friday matched the Houthi Samad-3 drone, the group's \"standard long-range strike drone\".\n\nThe model had previously been used in strikes against Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates as well as the southern Israeli city of Eilat several times, in attacks that were intercepted, he said.\n\nWhile Houthi claims that the drone used on Friday could evade radar were \"certainly false\", it was also possible the group had upgraded the drone to increase its range, including by making the warhead lighter or increasing the size of the fuel tank. It was hard to pinpoint the exact range of the Samad-3, but Hinz said that estimates were between 1100 to 1500 miles.\n\nThe pictures of the debris appeared to show a \"slightly higher performance\" Iranian-made engine than those normally seen on the Samad-3, he said. It was unclear, he added, \"whether it's a standard Samad-3 version that just got lucky and got through, or whether it's a slightly upgraded or improved version\".\n\nWhile shorter-range versions of the Samad drones were piloted via a radio link and cameras, the longer-range models relied on satellite navigation. Such systems can be jammed, but antennas resistant to jamming had been observed on Iranian drones, he said.\n\nIt was difficult to determine exactly where the drone was launched from, given that it appeared to have changed direction at least once, as it headed to Tel Aviv from the Mediterranean Sea, Hinz said.\n\nOther Iranian-backed groups, in Iraq and Lebanon, had tended to use smaller Samad models than the one used Friday. If the Houthis had developed a longer-range drone, such a weapon would provide them with \"new angles of attack\" that could put additional strains on detection systems and Israel's capabilities.\n\nIf Yemen is determined to be the launch site, Israel would find it difficult to launch a counterstrike, according to Harrison Mann, a former US Army officer who worked at the Defence Intelligence Agency. Even the United States has struggled to locate Houthi targets, he said, and has already hit the most worthwhile one.\n\nHamas praised the drone attack in statement, and called on Yemeni militants to launch more of them in defence of the \"innocents in Gaza\".\n\nTel Aviv's mayor, Ron Huldai, posted on X that the city was on \"high alert\" after the drone attack and that residents were required to follow emergency instructions. \"The war is still here, and it is hard and painful,\" he said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the drone was targeting the US Embassy branch office. US Embassy officials in Israel did not respond to request for comment early Friday.", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [],

Medical services said four people suffered \"relatively minor\" injuries.\n\nDefence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed to avenge the drone attack.\n\n\"The security system will settle the score with all who try to harm the state of Israel, or sends terrorism against it, in a decisive and surprising manner,\" he said in comments posted on social media platform X.\n\n- 'Everything blew out' -\n\nIn grainy security camera footage, the buzz of what appeared to be the drone was followed by an explosion that shook the building and set off car alarms.\n\nThe blast occurred about 100 metres (300 feet) from a US embassy annexe, said an AFP journalist who saw broken windows along the street lined with apartment blocks.\n\n\"It woke me up because the vibration of the sound was like a 747 (jet) coming in,\" said Kenneth Davis, an Israeli who was staying in a hotel opposite the building which was hit.\n\n\"And then the explosion... everything blew out in the room,\" he told AFPTV.\n\nHagari said Israel \"intercepted another UAV trying to infiltrate from the east\" at around the same time as the Tel Aviv attack.\n\n\"We are investigating why the UAV was not identified as a threat and intercepted before it struck,\" he said.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, has claimed drone strikes against targets in Israel, labelling many of them \"joint operations\" with the Huthis.\n\nSince November, the Huthis have also carried out dozens of drone and missile attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden that they claim is Israeli-linked.\n\nThe United States and Britain launched a campaign of air strikes in January to deter the attacks on merchant vessels.\n\nThe Gaza war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 38,848 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory, where fighting raged on Friday.\n\n- WHO reports no polio cases -\n\nResidents said clashes were heard between Palestinian fighters and the Israeli army, with explosions and shelling in the Tal al-Hawa district of Gaza City.\n\nThe war has destroyed much of Gaza's housing and other infrastructure, leaving virtually the entire population displaced and short of food and drinking water.\n\nMany are living in unsanitary conditions. Health authorities in Gaza and Israel said on Thursday that poliovirus had been detected in Gaza sewage samples.\n\nThe World Health Organization said on Friday that no cases of the highly infectious disease had been discovered in Gaza so far.\n\nburs-dv/jkb/kir", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sharon_aronowicz@ktbs.com", "name": "Sharon

The man was found in his apartment and had shrapnel injuries, the Tel Aviv police said in a statement.\n\nThe police said 10 people had been wounded and described them as \"lightly injured.\" Four of them suffered penetrating and blunt force trauma, said Roee Klein, a paramedic for the national emergency service, in a video.\n\nWitnesses described a \"very loud explosion\" that could be heard miles away. Surveillance video widely circulated on social media and verified by Storyful shows a bright flash of light, followed by a boom and the sound of an alarm.\n\nThe police said that a large number of forces was responding to the explosion. The military said that security forces were at the scene and that the air force had increased patrols of Israeli air space.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Huldai", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron Huldai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(weaponry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fragmentation (weaponry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blunt trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Explosion-in-Tel-Aviv-Kills-at-Least-One.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

He's due to meet U.S. President Joe Biden and address Congress on July 24.\n\nThe explosion happened close to Tel Aviv's sea front and a U.S. embassy branch, according to Israeli emergency services. The Israeli military said no sirens were activated and declined to comment if the American facility was the intended target.\n\nThe man who was killed was around 50 and eight people were injured. The attack happened close to 3 a.m. local time.\n\n\"An initial inquiry indicates that the explosion in Tel Aviv was caused by the falling of an aerial target,\" the Israeli military said.\n\nIt later added that the drone was detected and it's investigating why it wasn't shot down.\n\nThe Houthis started targeting Israel with drones and missiles shortly after the war in Gaza started. But, at least until now, none of their attacks are thought to have caused significant damage in Israel, with most being intercepted or failing to reach the country, which lies around 1,900 kilometers (1,180 miles) from Yemen.\n\nIsrael's largely avoided direct retaliation against the Houthis.\n\nDrone warfare has exposed a vulnerability in Israel's vaunted air defenses. The Iron Dome system -- which uses interceptors against incoming short-range missiles -- is effective against large objects, but many smaller drones are able to slip through.\n\nDozens of drones, primarily those fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon, have evaded the military's defenses this year and caused casualties and damage in Israel. The army is testing a laser-based system designed for small projectiles, though it won't be ready before 2025.\n\nThe Houthis have caused havoc in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November, attacking commercial and military ships and forcing most Western-linked vessels to avoid the area. They've stepped up those naval assaults in the past six weeks.\n\nThe Islamists say they're acting in solidarity with Palestinians and will continue their attacks until there's a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nThey are, along with Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon, part of Iran's \"axis of resistance\" -- anti-U.S. and anti-Israel militias in the Middle East that receive training and funding from Tehran.\n\nSince Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza, several of those groups have targeted Israel, U.S. bases in region or Western commercial interests.\n\nThe likes of the U.S., European Union and India have moved warships to the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in an attempt to thwart the Houthi shipping attacks. The U.S. and U.K. have also been striking Houthi positions in Yemen regularly since January. They say those have degraded the group's military capabilities, though it's still able to hit vessels and Iran continues to resupply it.\n\nBezalel Smotrich, Israel's far-right finance minister, said the drone strike on Tel Aviv showed that the government has to continue the war in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed.\n\n\"In a region where only strength and power are understood, we do not have the privilege of ending the war without a complete victory in all arenas and the removal of the threat posed by them,\" he said on X.\n\n-------\n\n(With assistance from Patrick Sykes and Paul Abelsky.)\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.

Health authorities in Gaza and Israel said on Thursday that highly infectious polio has been detected in Gaza sewage samples.\n\n\"The humanitarian situation... is a moral stain on us all,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that, despite mounting pressure both at home and from abroad, there would be no let-up in Israel's campaign against Hamas.\n\nFar-right members of his governing coalition oppose a truce deal, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir who on Thursday said Netanyahu must not make a \"surrender\" accord with Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu is set to address the US Congress next Wednesday.\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden was expected to meet with him, but it will depend on the US leader's recovery from Covid.\n\nAhead of Netanyahu's visit, Israeli lawmakers passed a symbolic resolution opposing the creation of a Palestinian state -- a move criticised by the United Nations and one that clashes with US ambitions for the region.\n\nDespite the Israeli vote, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby reiterated \"our firm belief in the power and the promise of the two-state solution.\"\n\nburs-dv/it", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv,\" the statement said, adding that \"the operation has achieved its goals successfully\".\n\nThe Houthi announcement came after Israeli police reported a powerful explosion of unknown origin that went off in a building in Tel Aviv around 3am (1am Irish time).\n\nPolice said a search after the attack revealed one man \"dead in his apartment,\" bearing injuries caused by shrapnel.\n\nThe explosion left one person dead and two lightly injured, an Israeli emergency services spokesperson said.\n\nThe Magen David Adom emergency medical service said four people were taken to hospital with \"relatively minor\" injuries.\n\nThe Israeli army said the blast was \"caused by the falling of an aerial target\", according to an initial inquiry, and a military official later said a \"very big\" drone was responsible.\n\n\"No sirens were activated,\" the army said in a statement, adding that the air force had \"increased its air patrols in order to protect

signal solidarity with Palestinians amid the Gaza war.\n\nThe Houthis have also alleged several attacks targeting the Israeli port city of Eilat, on the Gulf of Aqaba, but the strike is the first

For months, there have been concerns that Israel could go to war in Lebanon with the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. Friday's drone attack occurred not long after Israel announced it killed a senior Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon, and the fatal incident will likely raise further concerns that the war in Gaza risks spiraling into a much broader, regional conflict.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is preparing to visit the US next week to address Congress. Though the US and Israel remain close allies, Netanyahu's prosecution of the war in Gaza has made him unpopular with some Democratic lawmakers in Washington - particularly progressives - and he has frequently butted heads with the Biden administration.\n\nThe fact that the Knesset on Thursday overwhelmingly voted in favor of a resolution rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state - a move indicative of growing Israeli opposition to a two-state solution, a goal the US has pushed for decades - could also lead to some awkward conversations for Netanyahu in Washington.", "source": {"uri": "gzeromedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GZERO Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lebanese Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knesset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.gzeromedia.com/media-library/israeli-police-search-the-scene-of-an-explosion-near-a-branch-of-the-us-embassy-in-tel-aviv-early-friday.png?id=52950962&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C11", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The Houthis have claimed solidarity with the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and have launched drone and missile attacks from Yemen to disrupt Israel.\n\nMost of the Houthi attacks have targeted commercial ships in the Red Sea and its adjoining waterways. The Houthis have claimed to target ships connected to Israel or its allies and partners.

Medical services said four people suffered \"relatively minor\" injuries.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed to avenge the drone attack.\n\n\"The security system will settle the score with all who try to harm the state of Israel, or sends terrorism against it, in a decisive and surprising manner,\" he said in comments released on social media platform X.\n\nIn grainy security camera footage, the buzz of what appeared to be the drone was followed by an explosion that shook the building and set off car alarms.\n\nThe blast occurred about 100 metres (yards) from a US embassy annex, said an AFP journalist who saw broken windows along the street lined with apartment blocks.\n\n\"It woke me up because the vibration of the sound was like a 747 coming in,\" said Kenneth Davis, an Israeli who was staying in a hotel opposite the struck building.\n\n\"And then the explosion... everything blew out in the room, the windows and things from the ceiling, and it was on me, nothing heavy, but lots of pieces of stuff,\" he told AFPTV.\n\nHagari said Israel \"intercepted another UAV trying to infiltrate from the east\" at around the same time as the Tel Aviv attack.\n\n\"We are investigating why the UAV was not identified as a threat and intercepted before it struck,\" he said. \"I want to emphasise that (Israel's air) defence is not impenetrable.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, has claimed drone strikes against targets in Israel, labelling many of them \"joint operations\" with the Huthis.\n\nThe United States and Britain launched a campaign of air strikes in January to deter Huthi attacks on ships.\n\nThe Gaza war was triggered by the October 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's military retaliation to wipe out Hamas has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, where fighting raged on Friday.\n\nResidents said clashes were heard between Palestinian fighters and the Israeli army, with explosions and shelling in the Tal al-Hawa district of Gaza City.\n\nThe war has destroyed much of Gaza's housing and other infrastructure, leaving almost all the population displaced, short of food and drinking water.\n\nMany are living in unsanitary conditions. Health authorities in Gaza and Israel said on Thursday that a highly infectious polio virus has been detected in Gaza sewage samples.\n\nThe World Health Organization said on Friday however that so far no cases of polio had been discovered in Gaza.\n\n\"The humanitarian situation... is a moral stain on us all,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that, despite mounting pressure both at home and from abroad, there would be no let-up in Israel's campaign against Hamas.\n\nFar-right members of his governing coalition oppose a truce deal, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir who on Thursday said Netanyahu must not make a \"surrender\" accord with Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu is set to address the US Congress next Wednesday.\n\nAhead of his trip, Israeli lawmakers passed a symbolic resolution opposing the creation of a Palestinian state -- a move criticised by the United Nations and one that clashes with US ambitions for the region.\n\nDespite the vote, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby reiterated \"our firm belief in the power and the promise of the two-state solution\".", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki",

According to the police, who corroborated the information of the Israeli media, the body was found in a building near the explosion and showed signs of shrapnel wounds.\n\nThe targeted building is located on Ben Yehuda Street in Tel Aviv, and a state of panic among settlers in the city due to the loud explosion, which was heard as far away as the West Bank.\n\nIsraeli media sources revealed that a large drone approached Tel Aviv from the sea at a low altitude. It is still unclear how the drone managed to bypass all defensive systems and strike the building.\n\nFootage of the explosion and its aftermath showed the drone's engine noise before the impact. Israeli media reported that multiple drones targeted the area, but the Israeli military has yet to provide official details.\n\nNear the US embassy\n\nPalestinian journalists noted that the explosion occurred on one of Tel Aviv's major streets in a heavily secured area with additional air defenses, including the nearby US embassy, as confirmed by journalist Samer Khowaira.\n\nAccording to Khowaira, the drone used in the operation resembles one owned by Hezbollah.\n\nAbout an hour after the explosion, all initial speculations about the incident being a bomb or having a criminal background were ruled out.

Following the incident, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu conducted security consultations via phone. Israeli sources indicated a potential response in Yemen.\n\nThe Alma Research Center identified the drone as a KAS-04 model, equipped with 40 kilograms of explosives. Launched from Yemen, it traveled nearly 2,000 kilometers, with reduced explosives to allow for increased fuel capacity.\n\nIsraeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari confirmed that the drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model, striking a building near the US Embassy in Tel Aviv. \"Our assessments indicate the drone flew from Yemen to Tel Aviv,\" Hagari stated at a press conference.\n\nThe Houthis have repeatedly launched drones and missiles towards Israel and at Israeli-linked shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in a show of support for Palestinians amid Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nUntil the early morning attack on Friday, all attempts to hit Israel by the Houthis were intercepted by either Israeli defences or Western allies with forces stationed in the region, The Associated Press news agency reported.\n\nHezbollah in southern Lebanon has also stepped up attacks against military targets in northern Israel, saying they are also acting in solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel's war on Gaza, which has killed almost 39,000 people.\n\nFollowing the latest drone attack, Hezbollah welcomed the development as \"a triumph for the oppression of the Palestinian people and their fighters\".\n\nIt said the Yemeni fighters were supporting \"the heroic\" Palestinian fighters in Gaza who in turn are defending \"all our people and countries of our Arab and Islamic nations\".\n\nThe group said the fight will not stop until \"the aggression and the siege of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is stopped\".", "source": {"uri": "shafaq.com", "dataType":

The IDF official confirmed the death of a civilian and said at least 10 others were injured in the attack.\n\nIsraelis typically receive warnings for incoming aerial attacks, but the IDF official said an alert was not issued in this case due to \"human error.\"\n\nVideo shared on social media appeared to show the aftermath of the strike, with the air shrouded in smoke and shattered glass and other debris on the ground as ambulance crews and police continued to arrive to the scene.\n\n\"I was dead asleep,\" one eyewitness, Ken Davis, 56, an actor from New York, told Reuters in an on-camera interview. \"But this sound of this drone was like a vibration that woke me right up and then the explosion rattled the whole building.\"\n\n\"Everything was falling from the ceiling and the windows blew out in my room,\" he said, adding that he was shocked by how quickly Israeli first responders and military members arrived to the scene. He also said he knew the man who was found dead.\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack, which they said was \"in support of the oppressed Palestinian people and their fighters\" and in response to Israel's ongoing assault on Gaza, where local health officials say nearly 39,000 people have been killed since Israeli forces launched their offensive following Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks.\n\nThey said the attack was carried out with a new drone \"capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems,\" alleging it could not be detected by radar. And they said their operations would continue until Israel's offensive in Gaza ends.\n\nIn a briefing Friday morning, IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said a preliminary investigation suggested the UAV was a \"Sammad 3,\" an Iranian weapon that he said was likely upgraded to extend its flight range. He said it was believed to have reached Tel Aviv from Yemen.\n\nThe Houthis have been targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, as well as U.S. targets, since Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nThe attack comes as the International Court of Justice is expected to on Friday issue a landmark opinion on the legal consequences of Israel's \"policies and practices\" in its occupation of Palestinian territories.\n\nThe ICJ, which is based at The Hague in the Netherlands, has been looking into the matter since the start of last year following a request from the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nThe international court has previously ordered Israel to do everything in its power to prevent genocidal acts in its offensive in Gaza and more recently demanded that Israeli forces halt operations in Rafah, the city in southern Gaza once considered a safe zone, due to the risk to Palestinian lives. But to date, Israel has continued its offensive in the area.\n\nOn Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the Israeli leader had visited Rafah. The exact details of the visit, including how much time he spent in the largely destroyed city, were not immediately clear.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"},

He said the military is investigating the connection between the two attacks.\n\nAn Israeli military official said the drone that struck Tel Aviv was detected by an Israeli aerial defense system but was not intercepted due to \"human error.\"\n\n'I want to emphasize that the defense is not impenetrable,\" Hagari told reporters. \"We are bolstering our air patrols and the defense of the entire country's airspace. We are investigating the incident, improving, and refining our capabilities to better protect Israeli citizens.'\n\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said in a televised statement the strike had been conducted with a new drone capable of bypassing intercept systems. The Houthis have said their attacks on Israel and other western targets in the region are being carried out in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nMeanwhile, the Reuters news agency says rockets fired from Lebanon hit northern Israel on Friday and intercept missiles were launched toward aerial targets during a cross-border fire exchange.\n\nVideo provided by Reuters, taken in northern Israel, shows smoke rising from where the incoming missiles hit and intercept missiles being launched.\n\nThe exchange comes a day after the Israeli military confirmed it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon. The slain field commander in Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces was the latest senior member of the group to be killed in months of reciprocal strikes across the border with Israel.\n\nIsrael has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Israeli troops in southern Gaza on Thursday as their tanks continue to drive into the city of Rafah. The visit comes as Netanyahu is set to address the U.S. Congress next week in Washington.\n\nIsraeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir visited a contested holy site in Jerusalem the same day. Netanyahu's office announced the visit after he left southern Gaza. He later released a statement saying, \"Only the military pressure helps us advance the hostage deal.\"\n\nEarlier, the Knesset - Israel's parliament - easily passed a resolution opposing the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\nU.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Thursday Israeli politicians should not fan the flames in the wake of Ben-Gvir's visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. \"We would continue to urge our Israeli counterparts to do nothing that inflames passions or could lead to or encourage violent activity one way or the other,\" Kirby said.", "source": {"uri":

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"We are holding an investigation today and in the coming days to understand exactly from where the threat was fired and what are the needed responses to defend the country and what are the attacking responses against who is threatening the state of Israel,\" said Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for Israel's military.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the country's war with Hamas. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement published on the social media platform X. He said it was in retaliation for the Israel-Hamas war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nIsrael's military said it believed the drone -- an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances -- had traveled from Yemen, but rebuffed the Houthis' claim that their arsenal was capable of bypassing Israel's aerial defenses.\n\nAn Israeli military official said the explosive-laden drone was identified on Thursday but penetrated Israel because of \"human error\" in operating the system. The assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such attacks for months.\n\nThe Houthi strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv, hit at around 3:10 a.m. Local police said it reverberated to nearby cities and physically injured at least 10 people.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIsrael's military said they had not determined whether the drone exploded in the air or directly struck buildings, but it blew out windows and damaged cars throughout the coastal neighborhood. People thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel, said the blast shook him awake to watch the aftermath from his balcony and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war.\n\nHearing it was human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone is believed to have exploded, said he hopes the war ends soon, but he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nAnalysts and Western intelligence services have long accused Iran of arming the group, a claim that Tehran denies. In recent years, U.S. naval forces have intercepted a number of ships packed with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and missile parts on route from Iran to Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The Houthis maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom, however many have little or no connection to the war.\n\nFriday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas expanding into a regionwide conflagration as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations. The country remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIsrael's multilayered aerial defense system has intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. A military official said the system had identified the weapon but due to human error, was not set to alarm in case of attack.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided direct confrontations with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.\n\n___\n\nMetz reported from Rabat, Morocco.

The explosion occurred approximately 330 feet from the former U.S. Embassy building in Tel Aviv. Houthi spokesperson Yahya Sare'e described the attack as a \"significant military operation\" involving a drone capable of \"bypassing the enemy's interception systems.\"\n\nIn a follow-on press briefing, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that the drone, which the IDF believes \"flew from Yemen to Tel Aviv,\" was likely an Iranian-made Samad-3 \"that was likely upgraded to extend its flight range.\" Hagari added that the IDF is \"thoroughly examining the incident,\" including why Israel's air defense system did not detect the threat. Another Israeli military official claimed the failure was caused by \"human error.\" Separately, Hagari said that the IDF \"intercepted another UAV that attempted to infiltrate from the east.\" The IDF is \"examining the connection between the two incidents,\" he noted.\n\n\"The July 19 drone attack on Tel Aviv that killed one and wounded several other people, which was claimed by the Iranian-backed Houthis, represents the largest escalation by the Houthi terrorists since they began attacking Israel in October 2023. The drone threat they possess is now a clear and present danger to the entire region. Along with other Iranian-backed groups, they have created a deadly drone alliance to threaten Israel, the United States, and U.S. allies.\" -- Seth J. Frantzman, FDD Adjunct Fellow\n\n\"Drone and associated long-range strike proliferation from Iran to Yemen's Houthi rebels has consistently provided Tehran with a low cost, high return model of warfighting. By arming this group, the Islamic Republic has now succeeded in striking Tel Aviv with one of its drones. That is something the regime's barrage of 300 projectiles against Israel on April 13 was unable to achieve and is therefore a game changer.\" -- Behnam Ben Taleblu, FDD Senior Fellow\n\nIsrael has successfully intercepted multiple projectiles since the Houthis began orchestrating attacks on Israel following the October 7 Hamas atrocities. Both Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, which are designed to intercept ballistic missiles as well as fighter jets, and the \"C-Dome\" system -- referred to as the naval Iron Dome -- have been used to intercept Houthi aerial threats. On March 17, a Houthi-launched cruise missile impacted an open area north of Eilat, marking the first time the terrorist organization struck inside Israeli territory. The Israeli Air Force confirmed that it had monitored the missile until impact, noting that no damage or injuries resulted.\n\nIran is the primary purveyor of drone and missile technology to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, and numerous other proxy militias in Iraq and Syria. On July 8, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian reaffirmed that the regime will continue to support the \"resistance\" against the \"illegitimate Zionist regime.\" Tehran has also provided hundreds of drones to Moscow since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz emphasized at the recent NATO summit in Washington, DC, that \"the Iranian drones and missiles that are attacking Ukraine and threatening Europe are the same Iranian drones and missiles that tried to hit Israel on April 14. We have a common enemy and that is the Iranian regime.\"", "source": {"uri": "fdd.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "FDD"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_berman@fdd.org", "name": "Zachary Berman",

Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, told reporters that Israel's defense systems had apparently picked up the drone but failed to register it as a threat. No air-raid sirens were activated to warn civilians of the attack, despite Israel's extensive aerial defense system.\n\n\"We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,\" Admiral Hagari said.\n\nThe Israeli military said the drone had likely flown from Yemen, where the Houthis are based, before approaching Tel Aviv from the coast.

He said the drone bore technologies that made it difficult to detect.\n\nBut Admiral Hagari told reporters that the drone was a Samad-3, an Iranian model, that had been adapted for long-distance flight. He denied that it had stealth capabilities that enabled it to evade Israeli surveillance.\n\nMr. Amer said that the attack was a response to \"an escalation in massacres against the Palestinian people in Gaza,\" and that the Houthis would halt their assaults only when the war in Gaza ends and Israel's blockade of the enclave is lifted. He added that Iran was not involved in the decision to carry out the attack on Tel Aviv, but he said the Houthis had updated the Iranians afterward.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy_of_the_United_States,_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embassy of the United States, London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stealth aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/19/multimedia/19mideast-crisis-video-cgkt/19mideast-crisis-video-cgkt-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Emergency medical services said four people were taken to hospital with \"relatively minor\" injuries.\n\n- 'Everything blew out' -\n\nThe explosion went off in a street about 100 metres (yards) from an annex of the US embassy in Israel, said an AFP journalist who saw broken windows all along the street lined with many apartment blocks.\n\n\"It woke me up because the vibration of the sound was like a 747 coming in,\" said Kenneth Davis, an Israeli who was staying in a hotel opposite the struck building.\n\n\"And then the explosion... everything blew out in the room, the windows and things from the ceiling, and it was on me, nothing heavy, but lots of pieces of stuff,\" he told AFPTV.\n\nThe Israeli military official said an attack by the Huthis was \"one of the possibilities\" being investigated.\n\nHe said another drone was detected on Israel's eastern border and \"thwarted\" overnight, but he gave no details on where it came from.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, has claimed drone strikes against targets in Israel, labelling many of them \"joint operations\" with the Huthis.\n\nThe Gaza war began with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel\n\nThe war in Gaza began with the October 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's military retaliation has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, where fighting raged on Friday.\n\n- Gaza fighting rages -\n\nResidents said clashes were heard between Palestinian fighters and the Israeli army, with explosions and shelling in the Tal al-Hawa district of Gaza City.\n\nA Palestinian boy walks through heaps of garbage at a camp for displaced people in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza -- many are living in unsanitary conditions\n\nThe war has destroyed much of Gaza's housing and other infrastructure, leaving almost all of the population displaced, short of food and drinking water.\n\nMany are living in unsanitary conditions. Health authorities in Gaza and Israel said on Thursday that highly infectious polio has been detected in Gaza sewage samples.\n\n\"The humanitarian situation... is a moral stain on us all,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that despite mounting pressure both at home and from abroad, there would be no let-up in Israel's campaign against Hamas.\n\nFar-right members of his governing coalition oppose a truce deal, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who on Thursday said Netanyahu must not make a \"surrender\" accord with Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu is set to address the US Congress next Wednesday.\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden was expected to meet with him, but it will depend on the US leader's recovery from Covid.\n\nA handout image made available by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office shows him in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, where he visited troops\n\nAhead of Netanyahu's visit, Israeli lawmakers passed a symbolic resolution opposing the creation of a Palestinian state -- a move criticised by the United Nations and one that clashes with US ambitions for the region.\n\nThe White House reaffirmed Biden's commitment to achieving a two-state solution despite the Israeli vote.\n\n\"I think the best way I can respond to that is to just reiterate our firm belief in the power and the promise of the two-state solution,\" said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby.\n\nburs-dv/it", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

The strike, which bypassed Israel's air defenses, comes amid the ongoing nine-month war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. Concerns of escalation remain high.\n\nIn a dramatic escalation, Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone attack early Friday morning over Tel Aviv, Israel, resulting in the death of one person and injuries to at least 10 others, authorities confirmed. The aerial strike caused significant concern as it managed to bypass Israel's sophisticated air defenses, raising questions about efficacy and future security measures. Israel's military responded by ramping up air patrols in the area.\n\nAuthorities reported that the drone attack led to a rain of shrapnel over Tel Aviv's streets, creating a large explosion radius. Despite Israel's multilayered defense system, which has intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the ongoing nine-month war, this incident highlighted potential vulnerabilities. The Houthis lauded the strike as a success and signaled their intent to target deeper into Israel in response to the conflict in Gaza and recent events in Lebanon.\n\nThis latest development arrives as international mediators push for a cease-fire agreement to end the fighting, aiming to free approximately 120 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel's war efforts continue, both in Gaza and against Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, following the confirmation of a Hezbollah commander's death due to an Israeli airstrike.

Emergency medical services said four people were taken to hospital with \"relatively minor\" injuries.\n\n- 'Everything blew out' -\n\nThe explosion went off in a street about 100 metres (yards) from an annex of the US embassy in Israel, said an AFP journalist who saw broken windows all along the street lined with many apartment blocks.\n\n\"It woke me up because the vibration of the sound was like a 747 coming in,\" said Kenneth Davis, an Israeli who was staying in a hotel opposite the struck building.\n\n\"And then the explosion... everything blew out in the room, the windows and things from the ceiling, and it was on me, nothing heavy, but lots of pieces of stuff,\" he told AFPTV.\n\nThe Israeli military official said an attack by the Huthis was \"one of the possibilities\" being investigated.\n\nHe said another drone was detected on Israel's eastern border and \"thwarted\" overnight, but he gave no details on where it came from.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, has claimed drone strikes against targets in Israel, labelling many of them \"joint operations\" with the Huthis.\n\nThe war in Gaza began with the October 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's military retaliation has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, where fighting raged on Friday.\n\n- Gaza fighting rages -\n\nResidents said clashes were heard between Palestinian fighters and the Israeli army, with explosions and shelling in the Tal al-Hawa district of Gaza City.\n\nThe war has destroyed much of Gaza's housing and other infrastructure, leaving almost all of the population displaced, short of food and drinking water.\n\nMany are living in unsanitary conditions. Health authorities in Gaza and Israel said on Thursday that highly infectious polio has been detected in Gaza sewage samples.\n\n\"The humanitarian situation... is a moral stain on us all,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that despite mounting pressure both at home and from abroad, there would be no let-up in Israel's campaign against Hamas.\n\nFar-right members of his governing coalition oppose a truce deal, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who on Thursday said Netanyahu must not make a \"surrender\" accord with Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu is set to address the US Congress next Wednesday.\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden was expected to meet with him, but it will depend on the US leader's recovery from Covid.\n\nAhead of Netanyahu's visit, Israeli lawmakers passed a symbolic resolution opposing the creation of a Palestinian state -- a move criticised by the United Nations and one that clashes with US ambitions for the region.\n\nThe White House reaffirmed Biden's commitment to achieving a two-state solution despite the Israeli vote.\n\n\"I think the best way I can respond to that is to just reiterate our firm belief in the power and the promise of the two-state solution,\" said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby.", "source": {"uri":

Gen. Daniel Hagari said in a press briefing.\n\nAccording to Hagari, the drone was an Iranian-made \"Samad-3\" model that was modified in Yemen to maximize its range. The drone flew a distance of over 2,000 km, crossing southern Israel, and finally approached Tel Aviv from the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, he said.\n\nThe IDF will investigate the attack in depth in the coming days to reach conclusions on how to improve the aerial defense systems and prevent similar attacks in the future.\n\nThe attack that killed one Israeli and injured eight others occurred just a short distance from the U.S. consulate in Tel Aviv.\n\nAn Israeli source told the Saudi al-Hadath news channel that Israel is investigating whether the consulate was the target of the attack. \"We will also look into the involvement of Iran in the drone launch,\" the source added.\n\nApparently not ruling out future Israeli strikes in Yemen, Hagari said the IDF would determine \"what the required offensive response will be against those who threaten Israel.\"\n\nHagari added that another drone was shot down outside of Israel's eastern borders at the same time as the attack on Tel Aviv, and said, \"We are checking the connection between the two events.\"\n\n\"Since the beginning of the war, dozens of drones launched from Yemen have been intercepted. The defense is not hermetic,\" he emphasized.\n\nHagari also commented on the attempted assassination of Hamas' military chief Mohammed Deif some days ago, noting that \"The signs indicating the success of the assassination of Mohammad Deif are increasing. Rafa'a Salameh was definitely eliminated, Deif and Salameh were sitting next to each other at the time of the impact. Hamas is hiding what happened to Deif.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant completed an operational situational assessment regarding the drone strike, together with security chiefs including IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi.\n\n\"The defense establishment is working to immediately strengthen all defense systems and will settle the score with anyone who harms the State of Israel or directs terror against it,\" he stated after the meeting.\n\nFollowing the attack that shocked many Israelis living in the center of the country, which hasn't been directly impacted by the war in the past months, opposition leader Yair Lapid blamed the government.\n\n\"The crash of the drone in Tel Aviv is further proof that this government does not know how and cannot give security to the citizens of Israel. Those who lose deterrence in the north and south also lose it in the heart of Tel Aviv,\" Lapid wrote on X.\n\n\"There are no policies, no plans, all public relations and discussions about themselves. They have to go. We will know how to establish a functioning and efficient government that will restore security and power to Israel,\" he vowed.\n\nNational Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir attacked the government from the right wing, demanding a stronger military response to every attack on Israel and reiterating his demand for more influence on the war policy.\n\n\"The red line was crossed a long time ago in the north! When you contain fire on Kiryat Shmona and Sderot, you receive fire on Tel Aviv. This is exactly how the 'conception' was conducted in Gaza for years. 'Proportionality' and 'containment are obscene words when it comes to national security,\" Ben Gvir said.\n\nUkraine's ambassador to Israel, Evgen Kornichuk, sent his condolences to the family of the dead and wounded in the attack.\n\n\"It is so unfortunate that innocent citizens are murdered by the evil forces who are busy hurting and harming innocent citizens, including children and women.\"\n\n\"The same drones are attacking Kiev and Tel Aviv! I call once again to the leaders of the sane Western world, let's join forces to eradicate the axis of evil! We owe it to our children,\" Kornichuk wrote.\n\nRepublished with permission from All Israel News", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The man was found in his apartment and had shrapnel injuries, the Tel Aviv police said in a statement.\n\nThe police said 10 people had been wounded and described them as \"lightly injured.\" Four of them suffered penetrating and blunt force trauma, said Roee Klein, a paramedic for the national emergency service, in a video.\n\nWitnesses described a \"very loud explosion\" that could be heard miles away. Surveillance video widely circulated on social media and verified by Storyful shows a bright flash of light, followed by a boom and the sound of an alarm.\n\nThe police said that a large number of forces was responding to the explosion. The military said that security forces were at the scene and that the air force had increased patrols of Israeli air space.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Huldai", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron Huldai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(weaponry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fragmentation (weaponry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blunt trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Explosion-in-Tel-Aviv-Kills-at-Least-One.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The IDF official confirmed the death of a civilian and said at least 10 others were injured in the attack.\n\nIsraelis typically receive warnings for incoming aerial attacks, but the IDF official said an alert was not issued in this case due to \"human error.\"\n\nVideo shared on social media appeared to show the aftermath of the strike, with the air shrouded in smoke and shattered glass and other debris on the ground as ambulance crews and police continued to arrive to the scene.\n\n\"I was dead asleep,\" one eyewitness, Ken Davis, 56, an actor from New York, told Reuters in an on-camera interview. \"But this sound of this drone was like a vibration that woke me right up and then the explosion rattled the whole building.\"\n\n\"Everything was falling from the ceiling and the windows blew out in my room,\" he said, adding that he was shocked by how quickly Israeli first responders and military members arrived to the scene. He also said he knew the man who was found dead.\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack, which they said was \"in support of the oppressed Palestinian people and their fighters\" and in response to Israel's ongoing assault on Gaza, where local health officials say nearly 39,000 people have been killed since Israeli forces launched their offensive following Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks.\n\nThey said the attack was carried out with a new drone \"capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems,\" alleging it could not be detected by radar. And they said their operations would continue until Israel's offensive in Gaza ends.\n\nIn a briefing Friday morning, IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said a preliminary investigation suggested the UAV was a \"Sammad 3,\" an Iranian weapon that he said was likely upgraded to extend its flight range. He said it was believed to have reached Tel Aviv from Yemen.\n\nThe Houthis have been targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, as well as U.S. targets, since Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nThe attack comes as the International Court of Justice is expected to on Friday issue a landmark opinion on the legal consequences of Israel's \"policies and practices\" in its occupation of Palestinian territories.\n\nThe ICJ, which is based at The Hague in the Netherlands, has been looking into the matter since the start of last year following a request from the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nThe international court has previously ordered Israel to do everything in its power to prevent genocidal acts in its offensive in Gaza and more recently demanded that Israeli forces halt operations in Rafah, the city in southern Gaza once considered a safe zone, due to the risk to Palestinian lives. But to date, Israel has continued its offensive in the area.\n\nOn Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the Israeli leader had visited Rafah.

Emergency medical services said four people were taken to hospital with \"relatively minor\" injuries.\n\n'Everything blew out'\n\nThe explosion went off in a street about 100 metres (yards) from an annex of the US embassy in Israel, said an AFP journalist who saw broken windows all along the street lined with many apartment blocks.\n\n\"And then the explosion... everything blew out in the room, the windows and things from the ceiling, and it was on me, nothing heavy, but lots of pieces of stuff,\" he told AFPTV.\n\nThe Israeli military official said an attack by the Huthis was \"one of the possibilities\" being investigated.\n\nHe said another drone was detected on Israel's eastern border and \"thwarted\" overnight, but he gave no details on where it came from.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, has claimed drone strikes against targets in Israel, labelling many of them \"joint operations\" with the Huthis.\n\nThe war in Gaza began with the October 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's military retaliation has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, where fighting raged on Friday.\n\nGaza fighting rages\n\nResidents said clashes were heard between Palestinian fighters and the Israeli army, with explosions and shelling in the Tal al-Hawa district of Gaza City.\n\nThe war has destroyed much of Gaza's housing and other infrastructure, leaving almost all of the population displaced, short of food and drinking water.\n\nMany are living in unsanitary conditions. Health authorities in Gaza and Israel said on Thursday that highly infectious polio has been detected in Gaza sewage samples.\n\n\"The humanitarian situation... is a moral stain on us all,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that despite mounting pressure both at home and from abroad, there would be no let-up in Israel's campaign against Hamas.\n\nFar-right members of his governing coalition oppose a truce deal, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who on Thursday said Netanyahu must not make a \"surrender\" accord with Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu is set to address the US Congress next Wednesday.\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden was expected to meet with him, but it will depend on the US leader's recovery from Covid.\n\nAhead of Netanyahu's visit, Israeli lawmakers passed a symbolic resolution opposing the creation of a Palestinian state -- a move criticised by the United Nations and one that clashes with US ambitions for the region.\n\nThe White House reaffirmed Biden's commitment to achieving a two-state solution despite the Israeli vote.\n\n\"I think the best way I can respond to that is to just reiterate our firm belief in the power and the promise of the two-state solution,\" said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com",

We are in a long war and air defense is not tight. Besides the fact that we succeeded in shooting down a target from the east, we are investigating this event.\" He added.\n\nHe continued: \"We saw the effects of drones that tried to mislead us and changed the direction of flight during the flight.\" He announced that he had strengthened the air defense system, and indicated that there were no additional drones on their way to Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, sources in the office of the prime minister of the Zionist enemy said: \"Netanyahu is expected to cancel his travel to the United States in the coming days, following the targeting of Tel Aviv.\"\n\nIn light of the drone incident, the head of the local authority in Tel Aviv, Ron Huldai, announced that \"Tel Aviv-Jaffa has moved to a state of high alert.\"\n\nA Zionist military official said a \"very large drone that can fly long distances\" was used in the Tel Aviv attack. He stressed that \"human error\" caused the interception and defense systems to not operate.\n\n\"No warning was issued in Tel Aviv because it was not activated.\" He stressed that \"the matter is under deep investigation, many forces are working at the site, and the weather Air Patrols operating to protect the country's skies have been strengthened.\" He said.\n\nIsraeli Army Radio reported that the drone was monitored and was not intercepted because it was not classified as a hostile target.\n\nReuters quoted a Zionist military official as saying that he \"does not rule out any possibility regarding the source of the drone that hit Tel Aviv.\"\n\nAfter the attack, Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid called for the departure of Benjamin Netanyahu's government, saying that \"the explosion of the drone in Tel Aviv is further proof that this government does not know and cannot provide security for its citizens.\"\n\nLapid added in a tweet on the \"X\" platform: Those who lose deterrence in the north (Lebanon) and the south (Gaza) also lose it in the heart of \"Tel Aviv.\"\n\nFor his part, the head of the \"Yisrael Beitenu\" party, Avigdor Lieberman, described the incident as very serious, and that it is a direct result of what he called \"the policy of containment and humiliation\" under which \"the government of illusions continues to work and refuses to rise after the events of the seventh of October 2023.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the so-called far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said that Israel's red line was breached in the north, and those who work to contain the bombing of Kiryat Shmona and Sderot receive the bombing of Tel Aviv.\n\nThis is the first time that the Zionist entity acknowledges that Tel Aviv was subjected to a drone air strike coming from Yemen since the Yemeni armed forces began their operations against targets inside the occupied Palestinian territories and associated ships in the Red Sea, the Bab al-Mandab Strait and the Gulf of Aden.\n\nE.M", "source": {"uri": "saba.ye", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0633\u0628\u0623\u0646\u062a - \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0633\u0628\u0623"}, "authors": [],

(UPI) -- A drone fired by Houthi militants struck a building in Tel Aviv, killing at least one person and injuring eight others, officials said.\n\nThe attack occurred overnight Thursday near the U.S. consulate in central Tel Aviv.\n\nA 50-year-old man was found unconscious and suffering from \"penetrating injuries\" resulting from the attack in a building near the site of the explosion and was pronounced dead shortly afterward, a spokesperson for Israel's Magen David Adom national emergency service said in a statement.\n\nFour others were treated for shrapnel and blast injuries with another four for anxiety symptoms.\n\nOf the injured, two -- a 37-year-old man and a 47-year-old woman -- were at home while two others -- a 25-year-old woman and a 30-year-old man -- were wounded in the street.\n\n\"They were all fully conscious and suffered shrapnel injuries to shoulders and limbs, and one who suffered blast injuries,\" the spokesperson said, stating they were transported to a local hospital in \"mild condition.\"\n\nTel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai said his city was on heightened alert following the attack.\n\n\"The war is still here, and it is hard and painful,\" he said on X.\n\n\"Municipal forces arrived at the scene quickly and dealt with the incident, and we are prepared for further developments, should they occur.\"\n\nThe Israeli Air Force said a preliminary investigation confirmed that the explosion was caused by an \"an aerial object\" that did not trigger an alert when it entered Israeli airspace.\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthi rebels in nearby Yemen have claimed responsibility for the strike, with spokesman Ameen Hayyan stating it was carried out with a new drone named Yafa that is \"capable of bypassing interception systems and radars cannot detect it.\"\n\nHe called the attack \"a victory for the oppression of the Palestinian people\" and was in response \"to the massacres of the Israeli aggression against our brothers in Gaza.\"\n\nThe Israeli Air Force said it was investigating.\n\n\"The Air Force will increase the patrols of the planes operating to protect the country's skies,\" it said.\n\n\"'Proportionality' and 'tolerance' are inappropriate words when it comes to national security.\"\n\nIsrael has been waging war in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza against Hamas since Oct. 7 when the Iran-backed militia launched a surprise and bloody attack on the Middle Eastern country, killing some 1,200 Israelis and kidnapping about 250 more.\n\nEmbolden by the conflict, the Houthis have attacked Israel from Yemen and since mid-November shipping vessels that transit the Red Sea region as it tries to enforce a maritime trade blockade, citing it was standing in solidarity with the Palestinian people.\n\nNearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Fresno Bee"}, "authors":

But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nFormer St. Louis officials Lewis Reed, John Collins-Muhammad released from federal prison Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley elects not to pitch in All-Star Game, replaced on NL roster St. Charles teacher sexually abused teen girl for years, police say New St. Louis Public Schools communications chief also lives in Texas 'Steal of the draft': Cardinals pounce at No. 7 on collegiate infielder JJ Wetherholt Cardinals TV analyst Jim Edmonds draws controversy with Cubs celebration gripe Trump injured but 'fine' after attempted assassination at rally; shooter and one attendee are dead Grades for Cardinals position players: the good, bad and ugly St. Louis hosts emergency and military training for massive earthquake O'Fallon, Mo., firm to expand, add jobs with millions in federal dollars for semiconductor push MSD's recently retired CEO was paid more than $100,000 for unused vacation, sick time New report says MetroLink expansion in St. Louis would aid economy HOA rules in the St. Louis area can turn into fighting words St. Louis Public Schools halts hiring over questions on new administrator from Texas Lush gardens surround renovated historic Kirkwood home\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement published on the social media platform X. He said it was in retaliation for the Israel-Hamas war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nIsrael's military said it believed the drone -- an Iranian Samad-3 upgraded to travel long distances -- had traveled from Yemen, but rebuffed the Houthis' claim that their arsenal was capable of bypassing Israel's aerial defenses.\n\nAn Israeli military official said the explosive-laden drone was identified on Thursday but penetrated Israel because of \"human error\" in operating the system. The assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such attacks for months.\n\nThe Houthi strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv, hit at around 3:10 a.m. Local police said it reverberated to nearby cities and physically injured at least 10 people.\n\nIsrael's military said they had not determined whether the drone exploded in the air or directly struck buildings, but it blew out windows and damaged cars throughout the coastal neighborhood. People thronged to the area as police helicopters hovered overhead. For many, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel, said the blast shook him awake to watch the aftermath from his balcony and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war.\n\nHearing it was human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone is believed to have exploded, said he hopes the war ends soon, but he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nAnalysts and Western intelligence services have long accused Iran of arming the group, a claim that Tehran denies. In recent years, U.S. naval forces have intercepted a number of ships packed with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and missile parts on route from Iran to Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The Houthis maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the United Kingdom, however many have little or no connection to the war.\n\nFriday's drone strike on Tel Aviv could resurface fears about the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas expanding into a regionwide conflagration as international mediators continue to push for a cease-fire. The deal under discussion would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nSuch fears run counter to renewed hopes that Israel signaling its operation underway in Rafah nearing its finish could foster an environment more conducive to negotiations. The country remains divided over striking a deal, with some wanting the government to take the necessary steps to free the hostages and others, including far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir disavowing the idea. On Thursday, Ben-Gvir visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site to pray for the return of Israeli hostages, he said, \"without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\"\n\nIsrael's multilayered aerial defense system has intercepted thousands of projectiles throughout the war. But officials warn they are not 100% effective, and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones. A military official said the system had identified the weapon but due to human error, was not set to alarm in case of attack.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's archenemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided direct confrontations with Iran throughout the war. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel during a single incident in April in response to Israel's alleged assassination of a pair of Iranian generals in Syria at the time.\n\nThe war in Gaza, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has killed more than 38,600 people, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has created a humanitarian catastrophe in the coastal Palestinian territory, displaced most of its 2.3 million population and triggered widespread hunger.\n\nHamas' October attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants took about 250 hostage. About 120 remain in captivity, with about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nMetz reported from Rabat, Morocco.

The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\nThe strike came a day after Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Thursday, a move that threatened negotiations to end the 9-month-old war in Gaza.\n\nHamas' Oct. 7 attack sparked the war when militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and abducting about 250. Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 38,600 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nTwo international courts have accused Israel of war crimes and genocide - charges Israel denies. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza. Israeli restrictions, fighting and the breakdown of law and order have limited humanitarian aid efforts, causing widespread hunger and sparking fears of famine.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drone warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Itamar Ben-Gvir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/07/19/Israel_Palestinians_37648_c0-470-5616-3744_s1770x1032.jpg?ab78b1bc4db36a8bfde7104c165b29c5c49f3109", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1022, "textEnd": 1028}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

drone called 'Yafa', which is capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems,\" the Iran-backed Yemeni movement's spokesman, Yahya Saree, said.\n\nAccording to a report by news agency AFP, an Israeli military official said a \"very big\" drone was used in the attack on Israel's commercial capital, explaining that \"human error\" led to it not being intercepted.\n\nThe Houthis have launched scores of drone and missile attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November in a campaign they say is an act of solidarity with Palestinians.\n\nThey have also repeatedly

The Houthis have repeatedly launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the nine-month-long war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel.\n\nBut, until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X - previously Twitter - that the strike was made in retaliation to the war underway in Gaza between Israel and Hamas and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed that their newest drones could bypass Israel's aerial defence systems.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for Israel's military said on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\" The military's assessment of aerial threats has not changed because, the military said, Israel's adversaries have attempted such strikes for months.\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted to kill civilians in Israel,\" the Israeli spokesperson said.\n\nThe Houthi strike hit hours after Israel's military confirmed one of its airstrikes had killed a Hezbollah commander and other militants in southern Lebanon. Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nIt comes as international mediators continue to hold out hope for a cease-fire agreement, pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would halt fighting and free about 120 hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.\n\nIsrael possesses a multilayered aerial defence system, capable of intercepting threats ranging from long-range ballistic missiles to drones and short-range missiles.\n\nWhile these systems have managed to intercept thousands of projectiles throughout the war, officials warn they are not 100% effective - and the systems appear to have struggled against small and hard-to-detect attack drones.\n\nIt was not known which if any, system was deployed on this occasion.\n\nLike Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Israel's arch enemy, Iran. Israel for the most part also has avoided a direct confrontation with Iran throughout the war.

The incident, which occurred in the early hours of Friday, followed closely after Israel confirmed the elimination of a senior Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe Israeli Air Force (IAF) revealed that the explosive-laden drone had been identified prior to the attack but was not intercepted due to human error. As a result, no defensive action was taken against the drone -- described as a large, long-range attack UAV -- and consequently, no warning sirens were sounded. This lapse allowed the drone to strike directly at an apartment in Tel Aviv at 3:12 a.m., entering the city from the direction of the sea.\n\n\"The incident is under thorough review,\" stated the Israeli military, noting that air patrols have been increased to protect Israeli airspace, though no new civil defense measures have been ordered. The origin of the drone is still under investigation by the IAF, with potential launch sites being considered in Yemen, Iraq, or Syria.\n\nThe military spokesman for Yemen's Houthi group, which are backed by Iran like Hezbollah, claimed responsibility for the attack on the social media platform X. This claim has not yet been verified by the IAF.\n\nLocal police reported finding the body of a man in an apartment close to the explosion site and are investigating the circumstances surrounding his death.

drone, capable of evading radar detection.\n\nSaree warned that Tel Aviv would remain a primary target and declared the area unsafe for the \"Zionist enemy.\" The Ansarallah have been targeting Israeli-linked ships in the Red Sea since November in support of Gaza.\n\nThis marks the first acknowledged Ansarallah airstrike on Tel Aviv since their operations began.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant vowed to hold accountable those responsible for the attack and emphasized the need to strengthen air defense systems.\n\nThe Israeli army alleged that the drone was monitored but not intercepted due to \"human error.\"\n\nFollowing the incident, Israeli Channel 12 reported that the US military had intercepted four drones en route to Israel.", "source": {"uri":

Emergency medical services said four people were taken to hospital with \"relatively minor\" injuries.\n\nThe explosion went off in a street about 100 metres (yards) from an annex of the US embassy in Israel, said an AFP journalist who saw broken windows all along the street lined with many apartment blocks.\n\n\"And then the explosion... everything blew out in the room, the windows and things from the ceiling, and it was on me, nothing heavy, but lots of pieces of stuff,\" he told AFPTV.\n\nThe Israeli military official said an attack by the Huthis was \"one of the possibilities\" being investigated.\n\nHe said another drone was detected on Israel's eastern border and \"thwarted\" overnight, but he gave no details on where it came from.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, has claimed drone strikes against targets in Israel, labelling many of them \"joint operations\" with the Huthis.\n\nThe war in Gaza began with the October 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's military retaliation has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, where fighting raged on Friday.\n\nResidents said clashes were heard between Palestinian fighters and the Israeli army, with explosions and shelling in the Tal al-Hawa district of Gaza City.\n\nThe war has destroyed much of Gaza's housing and other infrastructure, leaving almost all of the population displaced, short of food and drinking water.\n\nMany are living in unsanitary conditions. Health authorities in Gaza and Israel said on Thursday that highly infectious polio has been detected in Gaza sewage samples.\n\n\"The humanitarian situation... is a moral stain on us all,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that despite mounting pressure both at home and from abroad, there would be no let-up in Israel's campaign against Hamas.\n\nFar-right members of his governing coalition oppose a truce deal, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who on Thursday said Netanyahu must not make a \"surrender\" accord with Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu is set to address the US Congress next Wednesday.\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden was expected to meet with him, but it will depend on the US leader's recovery from Covid.\n\nAhead of Netanyahu's visit, Israeli lawmakers passed a symbolic resolution opposing the creation of a Palestinian state -- a move criticised by the United Nations and one that clashes with US ambitions for the region.\n\nThe White House reaffirmed Biden's commitment to achieving a two-state solution despite the Israeli vote.\n\n\"I think the best way I can respond to that is to just reiterate our firm belief in the power and the promise of the two-state solution,\" said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby.", "source": {"uri":

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nRear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesperson, said an initial assessment suggests the system used in the attack was an Iranian-made Samad-3 one-way attack drone with an extended range. He said the drone was launched from Yemen and crossed into Israeli territory from the direction of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nIn video footage from Friday's attack, the unmanned aircraft can be seen crossing over a beach in Tel Aviv and striking a building, causing a large explosion. The attack occurred near the US Embassy branch office, although it's unclear if that was the intended target. The resulting blast shattered windows and sent shrapnel falling into the streets.\n\nAccording to a February 2024 report by the US Defense Intelligence Agency, the Samad family of drones has a maximum range of just over 1,200 miles, which technically allows them to reach the bottom half of Israel.\n\nThe Houthis have launched dozens of drones from Yemen, although a majority have been intercepted before they could reach Israeli territory, Hagari said. He added that the IDF is investigating this latest incident to determine why the Samad-3 was not identified as a threat and shot down before it reached Tel Aviv.\n\n\"Today and in the coming days, we will conduct a situational assessment in order to examine the incident, understand exactly where the threat was launched from, what the necessary defensive responses are, and what the necessary operational responses are against those who threaten the State of Israel,\" Hagari said.\n\nLooking at the available information, Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank, said that \"it's possible\" that the drone used in the Tel Aviv attack is a \"slightly more capable\" Samad variant.\n\nHe wrote in commentary on social media that \"for the Houthis, increasing the UAV range would be quite attractive as it would allow them to strike targets further away, fly routes evading enemy defenses and attack from unexpected angles.\"\n\nThe Houthi said their drone strike was carried out in support of Palestinians in Gaza, the same rationale for their ongoing attacks on merchant shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The rebels have spent months launching one-way attack drones and anti-ship missiles into the waterways, often forcing US Navy and allied warships to intercept the threats.\n\nIsrael has yet to strike the Houthis directly in Yemen. The US and UK militaries, however, have carried out several rounds of joint strikes targeting rebel facilities there, and American forces have carried out a number of unilateral strikes.\n\nBeyond the Houthis, Iran also provides military and financial support to Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nFriday's attack took place hours after Israel killed a senior Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon and raises long-standing fears that the devastating Gaza war could escalate further into a broader regional conflict.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news",

The Yemeni Houthi movement has claimed responsibility for the drone attack. The Israeli air force said it had identified an approaching drone, without confirming its origin, and failed to intercept it due to \"human error.\"\n\nThe device, which is believed to have traveled more than 2,000 kilometers, penetrated Israeli defenses without triggering the city's warning sirens. It exploded shortly after 3am. \"The war is still here, and it's difficult and painful,\" Tel Aviv mayor Ron Huldai reminded his constituents.\n\nSince November 2023, the Yemeni movement has taken on a greater role in the Tehran-led \"axis of resistance,\" thanks to the war in Gaza. In a statement, it claimed responsibility for \"a qualitative military operation, targeting one of the major objectives in the occupied area of Jaffa, known in Israel as 'Tel Aviv'.\"\n\nOn July 14, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone strike on the Israeli tourist port of Eilat, supposedly in response to the previous day's Israeli strikes - which killed 90 people in Gaza, according to the local health ministry - targeting Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, whose death has not been confirmed.\n\nThe Yemeni rebels launched a series of missiles and drones toward Eilat in solidarity with Hamas after October 7, 2023. These strikes caused neither casualties nor damage, and the group represented a distant nuisance to Israel. These attacks have been coupled recently with drone attacks against the port claimed by Iraqi Shiite militias, also allied with Iran, and with whom the Houthis claim to be working. Israel left the task of responding to this threat to an American coalition, which has been carrying out limited strikes in Yemen since January.\n\nIsrael has other, more pressing concerns than Houthi attacks on commercial and military vessels off the Bab Al-Mandab Strait, although these are disrupting international traffic, some 12% of which passed through these waters before the war. Since November 2023, missiles and drones fired by the Houthis have targeted more than 60 ships, some en route to the ports of their Iranian ally. They sank two of them, killing four sailors, and the rebels also seized a ship.\n\nAfter a relative lull in April, the Houthis stepped up their attacks, announcing a \"fourth phase\" of their campaign in early May. Their ambition is to extend this campaign to the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, although they have not yet demonstrated the capacity to do so. In response, the American coalition has struck in recent months in the region around the Yemeni port of Al Hudaydah, the country's capital Sanaa, and the central city of Taez. On May 30, a series of strikes killed 16 people and wounded 42, according to the rebels.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Emergency medical services said four people were taken to hospital with \"relatively minor\" injuries.\n\n- 'Everything blew out' -\n\nThe explosion went off in a street about 100 metres (yards) from an annex of the US embassy in Israel, said an AFP journalist who saw broken windows all along the street lined with many apartment blocks.\n\n\"It woke me up because the vibration of the sound was like a 747 coming in,\" said Kenneth Davis, an Israeli who was staying in a hotel opposite the struck building.\n\n\"And then the explosion... everything blew out in the room, the windows and things from the ceiling, and it was on me, nothing heavy, but lots of pieces of stuff,\" he told AFPTV.\n\nThe Israeli military official said an attack by the Huthis was \"one of the possibilities\" being investigated.\n\nHe said another drone was detected on Israel's eastern border and \"thwarted\" overnight, but he gave no details on where it came from.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, has claimed drone strikes against targets in Israel, labelling many of them \"joint operations\" with the Huthis.\n\nThe war in Gaza began with the October 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's military retaliation has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, where fighting raged on Friday.\n\n- Gaza fighting rages -\n\nResidents said clashes were heard between Palestinian fighters and the Israeli army, with explosions and shelling in the Tal al-Hawa district of Gaza City.\n\nThe war has destroyed much of Gaza's housing and other infrastructure, leaving almost all of the population displaced, short of food and drinking water.\n\nMany are living in unsanitary conditions. Health authorities in Gaza and Israel said on Thursday that highly infectious polio has been detected in Gaza sewage samples.\n\n\"The humanitarian situation... is a moral stain on us all,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that despite mounting pressure both at home and from abroad, there would be no let-up in Israel's campaign against Hamas.\n\nFar-right members of his governing coalition oppose a truce deal, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who on Thursday said Netanyahu must not make a \"surrender\" accord with Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu is set to address the US Congress next Wednesday.\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden was expected to meet with him, but it will depend on the US leader's recovery from Covid.\n\nAhead of Netanyahu's visit, Israeli lawmakers passed a symbolic resolution opposing the creation of a Palestinian state -- a move criticised by the United Nations and one that clashes with US ambitions for the region.\n\nThe White House reaffirmed Biden's commitment to achieving a two-state solution despite the Israeli vote.\n\n\"I think the best way I can respond to that is to just reiterate our firm belief in the power and the promise of the two-state solution,\" said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby.\n\nburs-dv/it", "source": {"uri":

The explosion led to chaos around the area as security forces and medical teams rushed to the site in response. Local media reported that the site of the explosion was close to the US Consulate in Tel Aviv.\n\nTimes of Israel reported that the Israel Defence Forces confirmed the blast in Tel Aviv was caused by a drone, saying an initial probe determined that \"an aerial target\" impacted the coastal city.\n\nThe IDF statement said that the issue was under \"thorough investigation,\" after the drone managed to enter Israeli airspace without setting off sirens. The IDF also said that the Israeli Air Force would increase patrols by fighter jets \"to defend Israeli skies\"\n\nAccording to the Times of Israel, the Magen David Adom ambulance service said that a man had been killed by shrapnel from the explosion of a drone in Tel Aviv. According to the ambulance service, the man was found lifeless in a nearby building. The ambulance service said eight people had been taken to local hospitals, four of whom were wounded by shrapnel. The other four were being treated for anxiety.\n\nMeanwhile, Saudi-based Al Arabiya news cited sources claiming that the Houthi terror group fired a ballistic missile and four drones at Israel overnight. The missile and three of the drones were reportedly shot down by US forces based in the region, and only the fourth drone managed to reach Tel Aviv, the Times of Israel further reported.\n\nEarlier on July 18, The Israeli Defence Forces said that they had eliminated Ali Jaafar Maatuk, a commander of the Radwan Force's operations unit, along with another commander responsible for Radwan's operations in the Hajir region. IDF said that the strikes targeted Radwan Force command centres in Jmaijmeh and Majdal Selm, southern Lebanon, also eliminating additional terrorists.\n\nThe IDF also reported that 20 Hamas terrorists, including Nukhba terrorists, engineers, and snipers had been eliminated. Among them was Muhammed Abu Jattab, a platoon commander and sniper.\n\nThe IDF statement said that Abu Jattab conducted numerous sniper attacks against IDF troops in Gaza, including the fatal incident on July 9 during a targeted raid to dismantle terror infrastructure at the UNRWA Centre in Gaza City.\n\nAdditionally, Ismael Shakshak, a Nukhba terrorist who infiltrated Israeli territory on October 7, was also eliminated in the operation.

The Yemen-based Houthi militia has claimed responsibility for the attack, which did not trigger air raid alarms.\n\nThe incident occurred shortly after the Israeli military announced the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesperson, indicated that the drone was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model, likely launched from Yemen.\n\nThe event adds to concerns of escalating regional tensions, as the Houthis and other Iranian-backed groups ally with Hamas.

Emergency medical services said four people were taken to hospital with \"relatively minor\" injuries.\n\n- 'Everything blew out' -\n\nThe explosion went off in a street about 100 metres (yards) from an annex of the US embassy in Israel, said an AFP journalist who saw broken windows all along the street lined with many apartment blocks.\n\n\"It woke me up because the vibration of the sound was like a 747 coming in,\" said Kenneth Davis, an Israeli who was staying in a hotel opposite the struck building.\n\n\"And then the explosion... everything blew out in the room, the windows and things from the ceiling, and it was on me, nothing heavy, but lots of pieces of stuff,\" he told AFPTV.\n\nThe Israeli military official said an attack by the Huthis was \"one of the possibilities\" being investigated.\n\nHe said another drone was detected on Israel's eastern border and \"thwarted\" overnight, but he gave no details on where it came from.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, has claimed drone strikes against targets in Israel, labelling many of them \"joint operations\" with the Huthis.\n\nMore from this section 'No more PC nonsense!' Martin Daubney hits out at 'political' Gareth Southgate after England exit 102 Dolphins Survived the Largest Mass Stranding in US History, Rescuers Say Israel lawmakers vote to oppose Palestinian state\n\nThe war in Gaza began with the October 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's military retaliation has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, where fighting raged on Friday.\n\n- Gaza fighting rages -\n\nResidents said clashes were heard between Palestinian fighters and the Israeli army, with explosions and shelling in the Tal al-Hawa district of Gaza City.\n\nThe war has destroyed much of Gaza's housing and other infrastructure, leaving almost all of the population displaced, short of food and drinking water.\n\nMany are living in unsanitary conditions. Health authorities in Gaza and Israel said on Thursday that highly infectious polio has been detected in Gaza sewage samples.\n\n\"The humanitarian situation... is a moral stain on us all,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that despite mounting pressure both at home and from abroad, there would be no let-up in Israel's campaign against Hamas.\n\nFar-right members of his governing coalition oppose a truce deal, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who on Thursday said Netanyahu must not make a \"surrender\" accord with Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu is set to address the US Congress next Wednesday.\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden was expected to meet with him, but it will depend on the US leader's recovery from Covid.\n\nAhead of Netanyahu's visit, Israeli lawmakers passed a symbolic resolution opposing the creation of a Palestinian state -- a move criticised by the United Nations and one that clashes with US ambitions for the region.\n\nThe White House reaffirmed Biden's commitment to achieving a two-state solution despite the Israeli vote.\n\n\"I think the best way I can respond to that is to just reiterate our firm belief in the power and the promise of the two-state solution,\" said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby.\n\nburs-dv/it", "source": {"uri":

rebels claimed a drone attack on Tel Aviv on Friday that left one person dead, saying it marked a \"new phase\" in its operations against Israel.\n\nThe rebels fired a \"new drone called 'Yafa', which is capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems,\" their spokesman, Yahya Saree, said on social media.\n\nIt struck \"one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv,\" he said, adding \"the operation has achieved its goals successfully\".\n\nIsraeli authorities said an explosion hit an apartment building in Tel Aviv at 3:12 am (0012 GMT), killing one person and wounding four.\n\nThe Israeli army said the blast was \"caused by the falling of an aerial target\", based on an initial inquiry.\n\nAn Israeli military official who spoke on condition of anonymity said a \"very big\" drone had been detected but the alarm was not immediately raised because of \"human error\".\n\nThe Huthis pledged to turn Tel Aviv into a \"primary target\" after months of drone and missile attacks targeting shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in response to the Gaza war.\n\nA member of the rebel movement's politburo, Hezam al-Asad, called the strike \"unprecedented\".\n\nIn an interview with the pro-Iranian channel Al-Mayadeen, he said the attack marked a \"new phase\" of operations against Israel which would increase in the coming period.\n\nAnother politburo member, Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, said the attacks would not stop until a Gaza ceasefire was reached.\n\n\"Our demand is fair: stop the genocide in Gaza, lift the siege on its residents, and we will stop our military operations,\" he said on social media platform X, sharing footage of the aftermath of the drone strike.\n\nTop Huthi official Mohamed Ali al-Huthi said the \"first operation\" to strike Tel Aviv marked a \"qualitative shift\" in the group's anti-Israel campaign.\n\nThe Huthis have previously claimed attacks targeting the southern Israeli resort of Eilat and port cities of Ashdod and Haifa, but Friday's strike is the first operation claimed by the rebels against Tel Aviv.\n\nThe Huthis' military spokesman declared the Israeli commercial hub \"an unsafe area\" on Friday, saying it \"will be a primary target within the range of our weapons\".\n\nSaree said the Huthis \"have a bank of targets\" in Israel, including \"sensitive military and security targets\".\n\nThey \"will continue... to strike those targets in response to the enemy's massacres and daily crimes against our people in the Gaza Strip,\" he said.\n\n- Ship attack -\n\nLater on Friday, the Huthis said they struck a Singapore-flagged vessel with missiles and drones because its owner had docked ships in Israeli ports.\n\nThe attack was confirmed by maritime security firm Ambrey, which said \"a Singapore-flagged container ship was 'hit' by projectiles\" southeast of the Yemeni port city of Aden.\n\nSingapore's Maritime and Port Authority identified the container ship as the Lobivia, saying the attack caused a fire which had since been extinguished.\n\n\"All crew are accounted for and are safe,\" it said in a statement, adding the ship had sailed \"under her own propulsion\" to Berbera Port in the breakaway Somaliland region of Somalia to assess the damage and determine necessary repairs.\n\nThe Huthis have attacked at least 88 commercial vessels since their campaign against shipping started in November, according to a tally compiled by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank.\n\nHuthi attacks have prompted some shipping companies to detour around southern Africa to avoid the Red Sea, a vital route that normally carries about 12 percent of global trade, according to the International Chamber of Shipping.\n\nEgypt's Suez Canal reported a 23.4-percent drop in revenue on Thursday which it attributed to disruption to Red Sea shipping over the past year.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

They had come to see the aftermath of a drone attack on Tel Aviv overnight. The drone had exploded and killed one person and injured ten just after three in the morning. Six hours later, most of the debris from the attack was cleared away. Police, a fire truck, and an ambulance remained nearby, and part of the street was closed. However, most of life was continuing as normal on this quiet Friday.\n\nTel Aviv is usually quiet on Friday mornings. The snarls of traffic that usually make the city impossible to navigate, are reduced. Many streets are taken over by people on stand-up scooters and others out for a jog, or heading back and forth to breakfast, or yoga.\n\nBen-Yehuda Street next to the impact site is a chaos of traffic changes and construction, so the once-bustling street is often now a ghost town. On the corner, across from where the drone hit, there is an Aroma, and several of its windows are cobwebbed with shattered glass. On three sides of the street are small mini-markets. There is a Thai massage place, a laundromat, and a few small hotels. Overall the damage to the street, cars and buildings did not appear outwardly great. Broken glass and shrapnel had rained down. Several officials came to inspect the damage and file paperwork. A man cleaned his motorbike from the falling glass and dust.\n\nThe site of the drone impact is within a few minutes walk of the US Embassy branch office on Ha-Yarkon. This shows how close this impact came, not just to the US diplomatic outpost, but also the line of hotels along HaYarkon. It just so happens to be that the impacted area is primarily a number of construction sites.\n\nTel Aviv has been in the crosshairs before\n\nTel Aviv has been in the crosshairs before. It has been targeted by Hamas, and it was targeted in years past by Saddam Hussein and also during Israel's war of independence. The Egyptians bombed Tel Aviv in May of 1948. During the War of Independence, soldiers who came back from the front would remark on how Tel Aviv went about its daily life of cafes and beach culture. Today, one could say the same amid the Houthi threat. While people gathered to see the site of the impact, they then went on their way. On Bograshov Street, a few minutes away from the site of the drone attack, people enjoyed their Friday breakfast. Some had coffee, others a sandwich. A group of older men, who probably meet like this every Friday, sat and discussed the day's events.\n\nTel Aviv US Consulate adjacent to scene of Houthi Drone Attack 19 July 2024 (credit to Seth J.

Health authorities in Gaza and Israel said on Thursday that highly infectious polio has been detected in Gaza sewage samples.\n\n\"The humanitarian situation... is a moral stain on us all,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that despite mounting pressure both at home and from abroad, there would be no let-up in Israel's campaign against Hamas.\n\nFar-right members of his governing coalition oppose a truce deal, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who on Thursday said Netanyahu must not make a \"surrender\" accord with Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu is set to address the US Congress next Wednesday.\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden was expected to meet with him, but it will depend on the US leader's recovery from Covid.\n\nAhead of Netanyahu's visit, Israeli lawmakers passed a symbolic resolution opposing the creation of a Palestinian state -- a move criticised by the United Nations and one that clashes with US ambitions for the region.\n\nThe White House reaffirmed Biden's commitment to achieving a two-state solution despite the Israeli vote.\n\n\"I think the best way I can respond to that is to just reiterate our firm belief in the power and the promise of the two-state solution,\" said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby.\n\nburs-dv/it\n\nMore from this section\n\nNational Nonprofit Petco Love Invests in Sacramento SPCA to Save and Improve the Lives of Pets in the Sacramento Region\n\nHow to Unlock a Disabled iPhone without iTunes?

The Magen David Adom ambulance service reported one fatality and eight hospitalized injuries, with a mix of shrapnel wounds and anxiety-related conditions.\n\nSources from Saudi-based Al Arabiya news suggested that the Houthi terror group launched a ballistic missile and four drones towards Israel, with US forces intercepting three of the drones. This incident follows the IDF's recent elimination of key terrorist figures, including leaders of the Radwan Force and Hamas operatives.\n\nThe operation also saw the death of Muhammed Abu Jattab, a Hamas sniper commander responsible for numerous fatal attacks, and Ismael Shakshak, a terrorist who infiltrated Israeli territory.

establishment is in a state of complete shock.\n\nThough the writing was on the wall, no one saw it coming from a couple thousand kilometers away.\n\nThat is despite the fact that Hezbollah has managed to successfully strike Israel dozens of times with drones without being detected.\n\nThe Houthis and an Iranian militia from Iraq have successfully hit parts of Eilat, including a naval base, using drones from late 2023 to mid-2024, without being detected.\n\nIsrael has essentially outsourced its defense responses regarding the Houthis to the US.\n\nOnly pre-October 7 thinking would have missed the possibility that the Houthis might attack other parts of Israel with drones.\n\nAnd now one Israeli is dead and around a dozen wounded in the heart of one of Israel's two most important cities, Tel Aviv.\n\nNo sense of immediacy\n\nIsrael has been moving in slow motion when attempting to improve their agency of shooting down low-flying drones, which can outwit Israeli radar, anti-air batteries, and aircraft much better than ballistic rockets.\n\nUntil now, there has been no sense of immediacy, despite the fact that either Hezbollah, the Houthis, an Iraqi militia, or Iran itself could use a drone at any time to attack just about any target in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem.\n\nLike the Hamas tunnel threat, which was ignored until it killed and wounded Israelis in 2014, this threat has been given scant attention because there were so many larger threats and because Israel has done, by and large, a great job shooting down Houthi threats to Eilat until this point in time.\n\nAnd Israel and the US, together with European and Arab allies, did a phenomenal job shooting down Iranian drone threats in April.\n\nBut the April attack was extremely forecasted in advance, and the success of defending Eilat only matters, that is, as long as the enemy sticks to the same pattern and does not patiently probe a part of Israel that the IDF is not constantly protecting.\n\nIt is an October 6 mentality only to anticipate predictable and recurring attacks as opposed to trying to predict where Israel's many enemies might find a soft underbelly.\n\nThe scary thing is not that the Houthis snuck one drone through to Tel Aviv.\n\nThe scary thing is that this incident stunned the defense establishment, and they are nowhere closer to a plan to protect Israel's citizens from future

Usually the Israeli air force's aerial defence array is pretty quick with figuring out what's a hostile target and what isn't,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think it's something we've seen, not in these circumstances, before. There've been dozens of these attacks from Yemen, from Iraq and Syria as well, where the army is able to identify them and engage them at an earlier stage before they even reach Israel - so this is an outlier.\"\n\nMr Fabian explained that everything from friendly and civilian aircraft to large birds is picked up on the radar - which only shows a possible target's altitude and speed - and that optical sensors like cameras must then be used, by human analysts, to determine whether something is hostile.\n\n\"In this case, [the drone] showed up on the radar and was just ignored due to some human decision and wasn't suspected of being a hostile target,\" he added. \"It's a very complicated and sensitive system that's not automatic - there are people that have to try and work out what the target is\".\n\nIt comes as the impact of the Houthi campaign is increasingly felt in Israel, with the Israeli port of Eilat declaring bankruptcy due to a sharp decline in commercial activities and revenues resulting from the naval blockade imposed by the Yemen-based militants on Israeli-linked cargo ships since last November.\n\nBut Michael Knights, a Middle East military and security affairs expert and researcher of Iran's militia network at The Washington Institute, told the attack \"looks like a fluke\".\n\n\"Eventually something gets through - there may have been a unique routing factor here and made this look like a helicopter or Israel drone,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked whether it could be a sign of Israel's defences being worn down amid constant attacks from several directions, he added: \"Let's see them repeat it.\n\n\"Presume for a second they used a new tactic or technology: The problem with stunt shots is that you blow the technique and next time they don't work. That's why major powers reserve their best kinetic and cyber capabilities for the big wars and don't use them in the meantime\".\n\nMichael Burleigh, a senior fellow at the foreign policy think-tank LSE Ideas, said he was surprised the defence and siren activation systems within the Iron Dome - the smallest of three systems in Israel's Aerial Defense Array, which has been effective at stopping short-range rockets fired by the likes of Hamas and Hezbollah - weren't \"computerised\" or operated by AI, adding that he did not expect that human error could come into play.\n\n\"Israel prides itself on its defensive shield,\" he told . \"Perhaps they're so focused on Lebanon that they're not really looking [in the direction of Yemen] at 3 o'clock in the morning\".\n\nOn the significance of a sole drone evading Israel's defences, Mr Burleigh said that usually \"it would be overwhelmed by the sheer number of missiles - that's what Hezbollah's strategy would be, is to hit it with so many missiles you couldn't intercept them all at once because they'd run out of the rockets needed to neutralise them\".\n\nHe added that the incident also highlights the \"complete failure of the British and American military campaign to suppress the Houthi; they've been doing it for months at vast cost and yet they haven't stopped their capacity to fire missiles and launch drones\".", "source":

A man in his 30s and a woman in her 20s were wounded by shrapnel and were taken to the hospital, while the others suffered lighter injuries, according to the Times of Israel.\n\nThe blast was preceded by a loud whirring noise, according to eyewitnesses as well as dashcam and security camera footage circulating online. A large number of Israeli police are on the scene, studying the shrapnel and debris to determine whether the blast was caused by a drone, local media reported.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are investigating the explosion, which it suspects was caused by \"an aerial target,\" a military term it uses for drones, the Times of Israel wrote, adding that no air sirens were heard ahead of the blast.\n\nThe explosion happened in the air, and the sound carried to nearby towns, police stated. \"The blast apparently occurred at some altitude,\" Haaretz quoted the police. \"We still do not know what it was. Right now, we are clearing the area. There was a lucky escape here.\"\n\nPolice added that eyewitnesses saw a \"red lump\" in the sky, which could explain why the explosion didn't occur in a building or on the ground.\n\nThe incident took place less than a few hundred meters from the former US embassy building in Tel Aviv on Shalom Aleichem street, local media reported. However, there has been no official comment from the authorities on the cause of the blast, while the IDF and Tel Aviv police continue to investigate the incident.\n\nSeveral photos circulating on X (formerly Twitter) showed alleged fragments of a drone at the scene. One showed a piece of hull, made of a substance that looked like fiberglass, with metal parts attached. Another showed a wing lying on the sidewalk, longer than the height of a person, next to a group of people.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rt@rt.com", "name": "RT", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consulate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consulate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrapnel_shell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shrapnel shell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Times of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RT (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy_of_the_United_States,_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embassy of the United States, London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiberglass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haaretz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_(watercraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hull (watercraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Explosives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Explosives", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/static.en/article/breaking.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The victim was later named as Yevgeny Ferder, who had moved to Israel from Belarus two years ago with the start of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nThe incident left many residents shocked and dismayed that even after nine months of war and the army's heightened alertness, a drone was able to penetrate the country's defense system without triggering any sirens. An initial investigation carried out by the Israeli Air Force said human error resulted in air defenses not engaging the craft.\n\nThe drone directly impacted an apartment building in Tel Aviv at 3:12 a.m.\n\nThe aircraft, identified by the IDF as an Iranian-made Samad-3 which had been modified to have an extended range, had taken several hours to reach Israel, flying at low altitude, according to the probe.\n\nErez Ram narrowly escaped physical harm after the drone's engine fell on his balcony, leaving shattered glass throughout the residence.\n\n\"This is something I've never seen. A drone fell on my home. Everything blew up. God forbid. The entire home is covered in glass,\" he said in a video posted on Facebook.\n\nSpeaking to the Ynet news site, he described being awake in his lounge when he saw the explosion, which shattered his windows.\n\nHe then went out to his balcony, where he found the smoking engine.\n\n\"The bomb squad came and everything was ok. In the first minute I admit I was terribly shocked, then I realized it wasn't active so I chose to start laughing and took videos of it,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, it was very random. A drone from the sky landed on my house.\"\n\nHe said his apartment was still \"habitable,\" and he would work to clean up and repair what was broken in the coming week.\n\nAviel, who said his home was slightly damaged by the explosion, told the Kan public broadcaster he had never heard such a loud explosion in his life.\n\n\"After seven months of reserve duty, I thought we were leaving the country in a slightly better situation. And now this happens, which is very disappointing,\" he said.\n\nMany of the roughly 60,000 Israelis evacuated from their homes in northern Israel due to daily Hezbollah attacks have been housed in hotels in the area.\n\nFor many of them, it reaffirmed feelings of disillusionment with how the military has handled the war over the past nine months.\n\nYossi Nevi, a retired evacuee from Kiryat Shmona living in a nearby hotel in Tel Aviv said the blast shook him awake and decreased his faith in the army's management of the war.\n\nHe said many expected such a strike to come from the north, which the military said had not been the case.\n\nHearing it was a human error, Nevi said, made him lose \"all trust in the army, not that I had much after the past nine months.\"\n\nEldad Namdar, who owns a camera store next to the intersection where the drone exploded, said some of the items in his shop had fallen but there was no major damage. While he hopes the war ends soon, he also wants it to be concluded in a way that secures his future.\n\n\"I don't want this to happen again in six months, I want them to finish this situation until the end,\" he said.\n\nThe blast from the drone was around 100 meters (yards) from an annex of the US embassy in Israel.\n\n\"It woke me up because the vibration of the sound was like a 747 coming in,\" said Kenneth Davis, an Israeli who was staying in a hotel opposite the struck building.\n\n\"And then the explosion... everything blew out in the room, the windows and things from the ceiling, and it was on me, nothing heavy, but lots of pieces of stuff,\" he told AFPTV.\n\nTespel Aragyi told Ynet the explosion occurred a moment before he entered the convenience store on the ground floor of the building that was hit.\n\n\"I heard a whistle followed by the explosion. The building then caught fire,\" he said.\n\nYochai Afek, who lives on the same street as the building that was hit, told Channel 12 that he and his wife awoke to the sound of the explosion that \"shook the building,\" and then saw from the window his car caught alight.\n\n\"We went down quickly and tried to put it out with a hose until firefighters came. The entire neighborhood came outside,\" he said.\n\nAnother eyewitness told Channel 12 he was with a friend at the beach when he saw the drone \"at the height of a building\" pass by.\n\n\"I said to everyone, hear that? It crashed into a building. Not a second passed, and we saw yellow in the sky. It came from the sea, without a siren or anything,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesofisrael.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samad_(UAV)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samad (UAV)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_duty_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reserve duty (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ynet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ynet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_disposal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bomb disposal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_12_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Channel 12 (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_evacuation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency evacuation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic mission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiryat_Shmona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Building_Types", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Building Types", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Build_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Build Management", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Explosives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Explosives", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/07/AP24201186806602.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel.

However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\nThe strike came a day after Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Thursday, a move that threatened negotiations to end the 9-month-old war in Gaza.\n\nAlso Read | Who Is Kim Young-hoon?

Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 38,600 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nTwo international courts have accused Israel of war crimes and genocide -- charges Israel denies. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza. Israeli restrictions, fighting and the breakdown of law and order have limited humanitarian aid efforts, causing widespread hunger and sparking fears of famine.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nThe UK restores funding to the UN agency for the Palestinians\n\nLONDON -- The new British government has overturned its predecessor's suspension of funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for the Palestinians.\n\nForeign Secretary David Lammy told lawmakers that humanitarian aid in Gaza is \"a moral necessity\" and that UNRWA is \"absolutely central\" to UK efforts to support civilians on the ground.\n\nIn January, the previous government paused funding for UNRWA due to allegations that staff from the aid organisation had been involved in the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nLammy, who travelled to Israel last weekend and urged a ceasefire, said UNRWA is already feeding more than half of Gaza's population and that the organisation will be vital for the future reconstruction of the territory.\n\nLammy said he was \"appalled\" by the allegations against UNRWA staff but having spoken to senior officials at the UN is \"reassured\" that the organisation is meeting \"the highest standards of neutrality and strengthening its procedures.\"\n\nThe UK, he added, will provide 21 million pounds (USD 27 million) in new funds.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Gaza refugee camps kill 12 overnight, Palestinian officials say\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Two Israeli strikes on central Gaza killed 12 people overnight Thursday, according to Associated Press journalists and Palestinian medical officials.\n\nSeven of the dead, including two women and three children, were killed in an airstrike on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza late Thursday evening, while the second airstrike hit Bureij refugee camp, also in central Gaza, killing five people early Friday morning, ambulance crews said.\n\nThe bodies were taken to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital, in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where they were counted by AP journalists.\n\nPalestinian militant groups call on the PLO to rescind recognition of Israel\n\nBEIRUT -- The militant Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad have called on the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organisation to withdraw its recognition of Israel in retaliation for a resolution approved by Israel's parliament rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nThe two groups made the announcement late Thursday following a meeting in the Gulf nation of Qatar between Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Islamic Jihad chief Ziad Nakhaleh and his deputy Mohammed al-Hindi, according to a Hamas statement.\n\nThe two groups said the Palestinian people have the right to set up their own independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nHezbollah says it fired rockets on northern Israeli village\n\nBeirut -- Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group said it fired a volley of rockets on a northern Israeli village Friday morning in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes the night before on south Lebanon that killed several Hezbollah members and wounded civilians.\n\nIn another attack, the group also said that it used for the first time a new rocket with heavy warhead to strike an Israeli army post in the disputed Kfar Chouba hills. Hezbollah said in a statement that the Wabel rocket, produced by the group in Lebanon, destroyed parts of the Rweisat al-Alam post and caused a fire inside it.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters fired a salvo of rockets on the northern Israeli village of Abirim for the first time since fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border began in early October.\n\nHezbollah began firing rockets shortly after Hamas' October 7 attack, saying it aimed to ease pressure on Gaza. Since then, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed over 450 people, mostly Hezbollah members but also around 90 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 21 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed.\n\nYemen's Houthi rebels claim drone strike that hit Tel Aviv\n\nTel Aviv -- Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone strike early Friday that hit part of central Tel Aviv near the US Embassy, killing one person and injuring 10.\n\nThe aerial strike rumbled through the streets causing shards of shrapnel to rain down and spreading shards of glass over a large radius. The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted to kill civilians in Israel,\" the official said of the strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv in months.

His new apartment was relatively unscathed.\n\nKarten said he and his friends were looking out of the windows just before the strike when one said: \"'Hey, what's that over there? It looks cool'.\n\n\"I turn around, I hear this large, deafening buzz, like an F-35 or an F-15, but it was only roughly 40 metres (130 feet) above sea level. It didn't make sense.\"\n\nThen the roar became an explosion.\n\nKarten felt the heat and got everyone to the floor and then to building's protective bunker, which has been regularly used since the October 7 Hamas attacks.\n\nRocket threat\n\nHundreds of rockets were fired at Tel Aviv during the attacks and in following days.\n\nNearly all were intercepted, so a strike that hits the city has been a rare event, no matter where it comes from.\n\n\"Obviously, all of this stuff can be replaced,\" Karsten said as he surveyed the damage outside. \"The most important thing is we left with our lives.\"\n\n\"It's important to note that this is a residential area. It's not a military target,\" he added.\n\nPolice said they received hundreds of emergency calls from neighbours after the blast.\n\nThe man who died was in his 50s and suffered shrapnel wounds, a spokesman said.\n\nKenneth Davis, who was staying in a hotel opposite the building hit, said: \"It woke me up because the vibration of the sound was like a (Boeing) 747 coming in.\n\n\"And then the explosion... everything blew out in the room, the windows and things from the ceiling, and it was on me, nothing heavy, but lots of pieces of stuff,\" he told AFPTV.\n\nThe Israeli military has blamed \"human error\" for the failure to intercept the drone that the Huthis said was a new \"Yafa\" model that could by-pass Israel's air defences.\n\nThe Huthis have fired dozens of drones at Israel since the October 7 attacks. Nearly all have been intercepted by Israeli fighter jets and air defence missiles.\n\nIsraeli military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said the drone was probably an Iranian-designed Samad-3, upgraded to have its range extended to reach Tel Aviv.\n\nAcknowledging that Israel's air defences were not \"hermetic\", Hagari said Israeli air patrols have been stepped up and the attack was being \"deeply\" investigated.\n\nMilitary leaders would decide \"what the necessary operational responses are against those who threaten the state of Israel,\" he warned.", "source": {"uri":

Israeli media reported up to 10 other people with minor wounds were treated in emergency rooms.\n\nIranian-backed Houthis in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attack, although an initial Israel Air Force (IAF) investigation has not determined the exact source of the projectile. While it has assessed the UAV was likely launched from the south - which means Yemen could have been its point of origin - it has not ruled out other sites such as Iraq or Syria. The IDF revealed it tracked the UAV's flight, but human error was responsible for the failure to trigger a warning. Meanwhile, the IAF increased its patrols over the area for fear subsequent attacks could be imminent.\n\nTel Aviv's long-serving Mayor Ron Huldai posted on X: \"The Municipality of Tel Aviv-Yafo is on heightened alert in light of the severe UAV incident tonight, in which one person was killed and others were injured. The war is still here, and it is hard and painful. The municipal forces arrived at the spot quickly and dealt with the incident, and we are prepared for developments, if any. I call on the public to obey gov't instructions.\"\n\nThe Yemeni Army declared the \"occupied Yafa area [Tel Aviv] an unsafe zone,\" and that it would be a \"primary target within our weapons range.\"\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nThis event is obviously concerning on a number of levels. Although it is unknown if the U.S. consulate in Tel Aviv was the intended target, the drone impacted very close to the building. Is this a sign the Houthis are challenging both Israeli and U.S. power, sensing a certain weakness and fragility, which each of the governments may have projected?\n\nFrom a deterrence point of view, the fact Israel's vaunted aerial defense system did not alert Tel Aviv's residents to the incoming projectile would have been seen and noted by Iran's other proxies in the region - in particular Hezbollah. There are already deep concerns in the country if the Shi'ite group based in Lebanon were to release thousands of missiles, it would overwhelm Israel's air defenses and lead to the loss of life of potentially tens of thousands of people. Serious analysts and commentators have frequently warned - and for some time - a war with Hezbollah will be hugely costly in terms of damage to the civilian and military infrastructure - and in human lives.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) acknowledged the downing of both missiles and UAVs fired from Houth-controlled areas of Yemen, which \"presented an imminent threat to U.S., coalition forces, and merchant vessels in the region.\" The IAF said it had downed another drone overnight - outside of Israeli airspace - reportedly fired from an \"eastern direction\" thought to be Iraq.\n\nContent created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Israel has so far not made attacks on the Houthis, allowing its allies instead to take the lead as it focuses its efforts on the war in Gaza and ongoing fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.\n\nThe Houthis have routinely claimed responsibility for hitting targets in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.

Houthis unveil Their new weapon", "body": "Is this Tel Aviv Drone attack the first of many? The Houthis have just revealed their new disastrous potential.\n\nRotem Meital, CEO of Asgard Systems in Tel Aviv, which develops military technology for the Israeli defense industry, spoke with \"Maariv\" regarding the UAV attack that struck a building in Tel Aviv early morning. (Friday)\n\nIs this a new UAV not seen in the war before?\n\n\"It's important to understand that this is essentially an Iranian UAV operated by Houthi terrorists, not a Houthi UAV,\" he explains. \"Iran began developing its unmanned aerial vehicle industry in 1985, with the goal always being increasing maximum range (to reach Israel and eventually the US) and maximum payload capacity, whether for attack drones or explosive suicide drones targeting infrastructure, military, and civilian targets.\"\n\nHe then adds: \"The drones Iran develops are like 'Shiite suicide bombers' - they fly and aim to hit their target directly and not to return home, unlike Israeli mission aircraft. Therefore, just like in typical high-tech - a new version of the UAVs are released every quarter and sent to operators in Yemen and the Gulf of Aden, and sometimes also to operators in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq.\"\n\nHow is the UAV that attacked Tel Aviv different from the ones attacking Israel thus far?\n\nWe still aren't sure. We do know that its dimensions, along with its overall shape, are different and most likely larger than the previous one, with an electric engine capable of traveling further distances, as well as being able to carry heavier payloads as the traditional Mohajer series 10 drones did. \"What we unfortunately do know in practice is that the UAV managed to penetrate the detection and warning systems of our air defense, possibly due to a human error and possibly due to flying at an unusually low altitude, which makes it difficult for the radars to detect, pinpoint the aerial threat.\"\n\nHow was the detection, identification, and interception of the UAV supposed to take place?\n\n\"Simply put, there are three stages in responding to an aerial threat. The first stage is the detection of the threat in our airspace and issuing a warning (detection and alert). The second stage involves classifying the information, understanding that what the system detected is indeed a threat, and identifying exactly what the threat is. Is it a drone, UAV, glider, paraglider, and so on. In this case, it was apparently a relatively large UAV.\n\nThe third stage is the actual interception of the threat in our airspace. This can be done using two different techniques: either in the spectrum dimension, meaning through electronic warfare systems (using techniques such as jamming, disrupting navigation and satellite systems, offensive cyber, and more), or through the good old kinetic method, effectively shooting at the threat using an interceptor or automatic gun.\"\n\nThe Houthis have issued a statement claiming responsibility.\n\nThe Houthi rebels in Yemen and the Gulf of Aden are a terrorist and guerrilla organization, a sort of militia (a Shiite-Zaidi terror group) operating in the image of their leader, Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, who was killed in 2004 by the Yemeni government due to his extreme threat to the regime. The Houthis are effectively an Iranian proxy, acting as one of its geopolitical chess pieces, much like Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and the militias in Syria and Iraq - forces that are 'dispensible' and are basically used like low-level pawns in a fundamental Shiite Muslim game of chess.\n\nThe Houthis are generally in conflict with anyone who is not them or Iran. They are at odds with the Sunnis, attacking Saudi Arabia and the UAE; they are in conflict with Americans (and likely targeted the US Embassy in Tel Aviv), and of course, they hate Israel and are extremely antisemitic.\n\nApart from gaining attention during the Israel-Hamas War, when the Houthis initially launched missiles and UAVs intercepted by the American destroyer in the Red Sea and later fired drones at Eilat, including at a school in the city, it's important to note that they have been around for quite some time, primarily targeting Saudi Arabia and the UAE until now.\"\n\n\"To conclude, do you think we will see an escalation in Houthi attacks on Israel?\"\n\n\"In my view, it is crucial to understand that these attacks are, in truth, Iranian. The Houthis are just a tool and proxy of Iran, with terror resources and weapons supplied by them. Given that Iran has long expressed its hostility towards Israel and has never concealed its intentions, it is likely that we will see an escalation in Houthi attacks as part of Iran's broader strategy.\"", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki",

The aftermath was evident in the broken windows, shattered shutters, and debris scattered around the area. Even cars were badly affected, and some were written off completely. Despite the city workers' efforts to clear most of the debris, dozens of residents and passersby continued to gather, visibly shaken by the events.\n\nIn speaking with the locals, many described a sudden flash of light followed by a powerful explosion that rocked their homes. Simon, who lives nearby, had been dozing off on his balcony when the blast occurred. He escaped with only a few scratches, but the scene outside was chaotic: fires, shards of glass, and scattered debris. Residents emerged from their homes, bewildered and scared, trying to make sense of the situation.\n\nAngel, another resident, recounted the overwhelming sound and tremor. The explosion brought people outside in a state of confusion and fear as they tried to comprehend the fire that had erupted. The experience left many feeling their sense of security was shattered.\n\n'Drone Attack on Tel Aviv inconceivable'\n\nA couple living in a rented apartment said the explosion jolted them awake, initially thinking it might have been a car bomb or a criminal conflict. The idea of a UAV crash had not crossed their minds.\n\nOne resident pointed out the stark difference in reactions between Tel Aviv and the north, where such incidents have become an almost daily occurrence. The intensity of the response in Tel Aviv underscored the contrast in daily experiences between the two regions.\n\nEvacuees from the north, staying in Tel Aviv for about nine months, shared their perspective. One evacuee from Kiryat Shmona noted the unsettling feeling that the violence from the north had followed them all the way to Tel Aviv.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hull loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_evacuation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency evacuation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_bomb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car bomb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiryat_Shmona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/610690", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745667", "eventUri": "eng-9745667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

These forces have amassed as many as 5,000 drones and missiles to strike Israel in an all-out conflict.The Israeli defense observer did not offer any \"solutions\" to the problem, apart from a vague reference to possible investments in offensive weapons.The Jerusalem Post contributor's concerns were echoed by Tel Aviv-based New York Times correspondent Patrick Kingsley, who suggested in his own piece Saturday that Israel \"has few options to retaliate\" to the Houthi drone attack, \"which made clear the weakness of its air defense system\" against slow-moving, low-altitude, low heat-emitting drones.\"Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister, has vowed revenge for the attack, but analysts said this weekend that Israel had few obvious options against a militia that shares no common border with Israel and has appeared undeterred by earlier displays of force by Western powers,\" Kingsley suggested, referring to the ongoing campaign of US-UK strikes in Yemen amid the Houthis' self-imposed partial blockade of the Red Sea.Israel-based Washington Institute fellow Ehud Yaari dismissed the prospect of Israeli airstrikes against the Houthis having any impact. \"What would be the benefit? If we enter the scene and we contribute our own strikes to dozens and dozens of strikes carried out by the US and the UK, that's not going to shift to this scale,\" he told the Times.As for Israeli air defenses, the NYT pointed out that they've \"repeatedly struggled to identify, track and destroy drones, particularly those fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon\" before Friday morning's Houthi strike.General Shafir expressed support for the Gaza truce idea, saying it may \"prompt some kind of a lull for a while.\"But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected calls for a ceasefire, and dismissed as false a report earlier this month that Israeli generals want a truce in Gaza and are ready to accept Hamas remaining in power - a prospect Netanyahu's coalition allies have fervently rejected.Hezbollah Sword of Damocles Hangs Over IsraelWhile the IDF remains bogged down in Gaza, Israeli officials including Prime Minister Netanyahu have been warning for over two months that Israel is \"prepared for a very intense operation\" against Hezbollah, sparking fears of an all-out war.\"The Israeli occupation forces admitted for the first time that it has a shortage of tanks because of damage of the fronts in Gaza and the north,\" Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised address on Wednesday amid the ongoing tensions with Israel. \"If your tanks enter southern Lebanon you won't suffer from a shortage of tanks since you won't have tanks at all,\" he warned.Nasrallah cautioned that if Israel continues \"to target civilians\" during its ongoing air and missile strikes in southern Lebanon in its skirmishes with Hezbollah, the militia will be pushed \"to launch missiles at [Israeli] settlements that were not previously targeted.\"", "source":

{"id": 223706096, "title": "&#039;Medical News&#039; monthly distributed to hospitals promotes anti-vax views", "text": "A periodical entitled 'Medical News' that uncritically promotes the views of anti-vaxxer and Slovak National Party (SNS) MP Peter Kotl\u00e1r can currently be found in the waiting rooms of state hospitals. Kotl\u00e1r was appointed in January as the government's special envoy for the investigation of the Covid-19 pandemic, but has not yet officially presented his team or any assessment of the pandemic period. Before accepting the role, he was mainly known in conspiracy circles, where he campaigned against vaccines, calling Covid-19 a biological weapon developed by \"satanic bases.\" One of the editors of 'Medical News' (its Slovak title is 'Lek\u00e1rske Noviny') has the same first name and surname as one of Prime Minister Robert Fico's advisors from the Smer party. When asked if he is indeed advising him, he did not respond. The Sme daily spoke to several doctors who are unhappy that the newspaper is promoting the views of people who reject evidence-based science. Medical news is controversial news Medical News is a monthly publication that is not audited, making it impossible to verify its actual circulation or sales. It is published by the company Veevent, which is registered to an address in Bratislava's Old Town borough. Karol\u00edna Koles\u00e1rov\u00e1 is listed as the editor-in-chief and Radoslav Koles\u00e1r as the owner. \"It is important to open old wounds, clean them, and let them heal completely,\" the April edition of Medical News quotes Kotl\u00e1r as saying in a speech to a conference reviewing the Covid-19 pandemic. Medical News dedicated three pages to the conference. The article in question, written by Marica Piro\u0161\u00edkov\u00e1, an advisor to Justice Minister Boris Susko (Smer), compiles quotes from conference participants. All the conference contributors criticised the management of the pandemic response in Slovakia and public health officials for pandemic management, claiming their emergency actions violated constitutional rights. \"From a legal standpoint, I consider the Covid-19 period and the inability to conduct a judicial review of anti-pandemic measures a dark period in Slovak history,\" the newspaper quotes conference participant Judge Dana Jel\u00ednkov\u00e1 Dudz\u00edkov\u00e1, suggesting comparing the anti-pandemic measures to totalitarianism before 1989. Slovak doctors are ready to oppose Doctor Milan Kulkovsk\u00fd told Sme that \"Medical News occasionally comes into my hands, and I believe they have their reasons. However, I must honestly say that I am disappointed by the promotion of a person who denies the principles of evidence-based medicine.\" Another doctor, who asked to remain anonymous, said it was inappropriate for newspapers with such views to be freely available to patients, especially in places like the waiting rooms at the National Institute of Children's Diseases in Bratislava's Kram\u00e1re district. \"The National Institute of Children's Diseases does not subscribe to Medical News,\" said its spokesperson Dana Kamenick\u00e1, when Sme enquired. \"It is distributed to us for free and, in many cases, delivered to the institute addressed to specific doctors by name,\" she added. Medical News defended its promotion of Kotl\u00e1r by citing its inclusion of other voices, like President \u010caputov\u00e1's. Is one of the editors Fico's adviser? Despite repeated inquiries, the Sme daily was not able confirm if Medical News editor Jozef Dermek is the same Jozef Dermek who is an official advisor to Prime Minister Robert Fico. Dermek the editor spoke to a Sme reporter, but he refused to clarify if he was also working for the prime minister, stating that he is not the paper's publisher or employee, just an external collaborator. His commentaries appear prominently on the paper's website.", "summary": "One of its editors has the same name as a Fico aide but refuses to confirm if he advises the premier.", "url": "https://spectator.sme.sk/c/23334781/slovak-medical-newspaper-anti-vax-views.html", "image": "https://m.smedata.sk/api-media/media/image/spectator/0/87/8781010/8781010_1200x800.jpg?rev=3", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:54:39", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "sk", "sentiment": -0.267}

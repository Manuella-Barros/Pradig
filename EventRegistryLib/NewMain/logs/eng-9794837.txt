He took over as country manager in late 2020. His departure comes at a time when the e-commerce giant is facing increasing competition in the Indian market. Despite investing over $7 billion in the country, Amazon has struggled to compete with domestic rivals Flipkart and Meesho.\n\nTiwary is leaving amid the US-based company's strategic shift toward its cloud business. His resignation also coincides with the discontinuation of several other initiatives by the firm, including its food delivery venture. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed Tiwary's departure to TechCrunch, and praised his leadership over the past few years.\n\nAmazon has encountered difficulties in expanding into smaller cities and towns across India. Industry experts suggest that these challenges stem from a limited product range for price-sensitive customers and underdeveloped logistics networks. In urban areas, the company is also facing stiff competition from quick commerce firms like BlinkIt, Zepto, and Swiggy that promise rapid delivery times of as little as 10 minutes.\n\nTiwary will continue with Amazon until October to ensure a smooth transition. The company's spokesperson emphasized India's importance to Amazon and expressed optimism about future opportunities in the country.

Despite a $7 billion investment in the country, Amazon struggles to penetrate smaller cities and towns where competitors like Flipkart and Meesho have a stronger presence.\n\nAmazon's limited product range and underdeveloped logistics network in these areas have been cited as factors, according to Techcrunch. Additionally, Meesho has surpassed Amazon in monthly active user share on mobile shopping apps, while Flipkart leads with over 50 million daily active users compared to Amazon's 40 million, as noted by Bank of America analysts.\n\nAmazon is also contending with competition from quick commerce startups such as BlinkIt, Zepto, and Swiggy's Instamart, which offer deliveries within minutes.

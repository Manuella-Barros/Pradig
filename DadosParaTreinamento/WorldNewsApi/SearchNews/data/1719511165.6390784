{"id": 223739330, "title": "Is bail reform keeping violent offenders off streets? Hard to tell, police say", "text": "Police in Canada say they are still waiting on more data to become available to determine whether Canada\u2019s bail reforms over recent years are keeping violent offenders off the street. Prior to the changes, the RCMP tracked that more than half of suspects in murder investigations in that force\u2019s jurisdiction were released early from custody. \u201cBetween 2019 and 2022, in the RCMP jurisdiction, 53 per cent of those that committed a homicide were on some form of community release,\u201d RCMP deputy commissioner Jodie Boudreau told The West Block host Mercedes Stephenson. It\u2019s a trend that extended to urban areas too that have their own police services, according to current Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police president and Winnipeg police chief Danny Smyth. \u201cI can tell you from my own experience in Winnipeg, we see about 20 per cent of those that we\u2019re arresting for violent offences that are, in fact, on bail. So that will be something that, collectively across the country, we\u2019ll really try to watch,\u201d Smyth said on the show. At the start of January, amendments to Canada\u2019s bail legislation came into force, reversing the onus for certain people accused of violent offences such as those charged with firearms offences and intimate partner violence. Reverse onus means the accused needs to demonstrate why they should be eligible for bail, rather than the onus being on Crown prosecutors to prove to a court why someone shouldn\u2019t be eligible for bail. Smyth says that generally speaking, most people who are arrested and charged with an offence are released the same day on some kind of order to later appear in court. \u201cThat reform took place in January of this year. It was passed and started Jan. 4,\u201d Boudreau said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have the stats for the last few months.\u201d Smyth echoed those comments. \u201cWe\u2019re really in a monitoring stage right now,\u201d he said. As the most recent bail reforms are studied, Smyth says that it is important that any future considerations find balance between public safety and the right to bail. \u201cI think focusing on repeat violent offenders, it\u2019s not a panacea but I think it\u2019s a good first step. And then I think it respects the rights of an individual as well, so that we\u2019re not denying people bail for lesser offences,\u201d Smyth said. When someone is on bail, probation, or some other form of community release, Boudreau says that violations are shared and warrants are displayed in a national database. However, Boudreau said it is not so simple as just going out and arresting an offender. \u201cAlthough that that information gets uploaded and the local detachments of our police service will be aware of the warrant, it isn\u2019t a matter of someone always being available to go out and arrest them, and part of the issue is finding them,\u201d she explained. \u201cSometimes bail is revoked. They\u2019re not living where they\u2019re supposed to be living, as happened with James Smith Cree Nation, and trying to find the person can be hard sometimes.\u201d In September 2022, Myles Sanderson went on a mass-stabbing spree that started at the northeast Saskatchewan First Nation. He killed 11 people and injured 17 others before ultimately dying of a drug overdose shortly after being arrested. Between 2008 and 2017, Sanderson racked up 46 criminal convictions. He\u2019d received statutory release from custody in August 2021. Statistics Canada has been reporting rising crime rates in the country following a drop in 2020 during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. To better address this, Boudreau says bail reform can only be one piece in a broader puzzle. \u201cI think we need to continue to reform the criminal justice system. This bail reform is one piece of it, and we are one piece of the system. I think we need to continue to reform it, but making sure both in custody and out of custody that those social supports are in place,\u201d Boudreau said. \u201cI think everybody would agree there\u2019s a lack of those resources, just like there\u2019s a lack of mental health support.\u201d", "summary": "Some of Canada's policing leaders say it is still too early to tell for sure if Ottawa's bail reform changes are having the desired effect of keeping violent criminals in custody.", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10523224/bail-reform-violent-crime-rcmp-police/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/_img/video-still.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:30:36", "author": "David Baxter", "authors": ["David Baxter"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.122}

It is nothing but a diversionary tactic and an attempted act of blackmail by a company desperate to obfuscate the grievous criminal charges it is facing in Nigeria.\n\n\"The facts of this matter remain that Binance is being investigated in Nigeria for allowing its platform to be used for money laundering, terrorism financing, and foreign exchange manipulation through illegal trading.\n\n\"While this lawful investigation was going on, an executive of Binance, who was in court-sanctioned protective custody, escaped from Nigeria, and he is now a fugitive from the law. Working with the security agencies in Nigeria, Interpol is currently executing an international arrest warrant on the said fugitive.\"\n\nBRIBERY ALLEGATION PART OF ORCHESTRATED INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN\n\nThe ministry said the bribery allegation is part of an orchestrated international campaign by Binance to undermine the Nigerian government.\n\nThe ministry said Binance is facing criminal prosecution in many countries including the United States.\n\n\"Just a week ago, the founder and former CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, was sentenced to prison in the United States, after pleading guilty to charges very similar to what Binance is being investigated for in Nigeria. In addition, Zhao agreed to pay a fine of $50 million, while Binance is liable for $4.3 billion in fines and forfeitures to the US Government,\" the government said.\n\n\"We would like to remind Binance that it will not clear its name in Nigeria by resorting to fictional claims and mudslinging media campaigns. The only way to resolve its issues will be by submitting itself to unobstructed investigation and judicial due process.\"\n\nThe ministry said the Nigerian government will continue to act within its laws and international norms and will not succumb to any form of blackmail from any entity, local or foreign.", "source": {"uri": "nigerianeye.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nigerianeye"},

The only way to resolve its issues will be by submitting itself to unobstructed investigation and judicial due process.\n\n\"The government of Nigeria will continue to act within its laws and

Since these allegations emerged, one of Binance employees has been imprisoned in the country.\n\nTeng accused unidentified Nigerian government officials of demanding a $150 million cryptocurrency payment to stop the ongoing criminal investigation against Binance. However, Rabiu Ibrahim, spokesman for the country's Ministry of Communications, rejected these claims, calling them baseless and a delaying tactic.

Criminal charges were filed against them on Feb. 28. Anjarwalla later escaped from custody on March 22.\n\n\"To invite a company's mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them, has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide,\" Teng wrote in a blog post early Tuesday.\n\nGambaryan was formerly a Special Agent for the U.S. IRS and has \"devoted his professional life to fighting financial crimes,\" Teng said. He was hired by Binance in 2021 to help the exchange build stronger compliance controls, subsequently assisting global law enforcement in freezing and seizing more than $2.2 billion worth of assets, including more than $285 million in cooperation with U.S. agencies like the FBI, DOJ and DEA, according to Teng.\n\n\"Tigran did not go to Nigeria as a 'decision-maker,' nor a 'negotiator.' He was merely acting as a functional expert in financial crime and capacity building in policy discussions,\" the Binance CEO added.\n\n\"My friend and colleague, Tigran Gambaryan, has been unlawfully detained by the Nigerian government for more than 70 days. We're tirelessly working to #BringTigranHome,\" Teng posted on X.\n\n'Let Tigran go home to his family'\n\nTeng claimed that during a bail hearing for Gambaryan on April 25, a prosecutor for Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) said to the court, \"The 1st defendant [Binance] is operating virtually. The only thing we have to hold on to is this defendant [Tigran].\"\n\n\"The message from the Nigerian government is clear: we must detain an innocent, mid-level employee and a former U.S. federal agent, and place him in a dangerous prison in order to control Binance,\" Teng stated.\n\nSince taking over from Changpeng Zhao as Binance CEO in November, Teng said he made a key commitment to work with global regulators and enforcement agencies, restructuring the organization and bringing in new leadership with compliance experience like Gambaryan to \"dramatically\" evolve the business.\n\nIn November, Zhao pleaded guilty in the U.S. for failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program and agreed to pay a $50 million fine. Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion in one of the largest corporate settlements in history.\n\nTeng said that Binance will continue to do everything to support Gambaryan, requesting that he be allowed to go home to his family, after which the firm would work with Nigeria's law enforcement to remove \"bad actors\" from its platform and with Nigeria's Federal Inland Revenue Service on resolving potential historic tax liabilities.\n\n\"This crisis must come to a resolution quickly, and Tigran must be allowed to go home if we're going to move forward,\" he added.\n\nHow we got here\n\nThe situation involving Binance in Nigeria began two years ago when Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission issued digital asset regulations requiring permits for crypto exchanges in May 2022. Binance attempted to comply but faced unclear requirements and non-responsiveness from the SEC, according to Teng. In June 2023, the SEC accused Binance of operating illegally, leading to Binance suspending the solicitation of Nigerian investors.\n\nAround the time Gambaryan and Anjarwalla traveled to Nigeria for meetings, Nigeria's currency, the naira, was suffering a steep decline, with many local Binance customers using its peer-to-peer trading platform to protect themselves, Teng said.\n\nBinance then began hearing concerns that the P2P naira prices from merchant advertisements were influencing the country's foreign exchange rate. The exchange worked on restrictions, including removing abnormally priced ads, and made it clear that malicious users would be removed from the platform. Despite assurances the meetings would be friendly, Teng added, the pair were still detained.\n\n\"To remove any doubt about suggestions that we had played a role in the country's currency crisis and as a good faith gesture, I made the difficult decision earlier this month to turn off our P2P product on the Binance platform for Nigeria and end the trading of all naira pairs on the spot exchange product on the Binance platform,\" Teng said today. \"Our hope when we took this drastic step was that our colleagues would be released and Binance could continue to work with the Nigerian government to resolve any further concerns. Unfortunately, that didn't happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblock.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Block"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_hunt@theblock.co", "name": "James Hunt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Financial_Crimes_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic and Financial Crimes Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changpeng_Zhao", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Changpeng Zhao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug Enforcement Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peer-to-peer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Barter", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.tbstat.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=webp,q=75/wp/uploads/2023/03/20230317_Binance.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-26", "textStart": 529, "textEnd": 536}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-28", "textStart": 654, "textEnd": 661}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-22", "textStart": 704, "textEnd": 712}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 1858, "textEnd": 1866}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

This is when Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published its crypto regulations, bringing the sector under its regulatory purview.\n\nHowever, with no clear rules and guidelines in place, no virtual asset service providers have received licences under the new regulations.\n\nTeng slams \"dangerous precedent\"\n\nOn January 8 this year, Gambaryan and other Binance employees met with members of the House Committee on Financial Crimes (HCFC).\n\nWhile the meeting initially targeted at bringing Binance and regulators towards regulatory clarity, it failed to achieve that and lawmakers threatened to arrest Binance officials, including the then new CEO Teng.\n\nIt's after these developments that Teng alleges individuals approached its representatives with the settlement proposal.\n\nThe demand was that if Binance paid up with 48 hours, the concerned parties would \"make these issues go away.\" Accusations include money laundering and tax evasion.\n\nBinance reportedly rejected the proposal and an \"increasingly concerned\" team immediately left Nigeria.\n\nIn February, Tigran and Nadeem Anjarwalla (head of Binance Africa) travelled to Nigeria and were arrested.\n\nCommenting on Gambaryan's detention, Teng says it sets \"a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide.\"\n\nMeanwhile, amid the regulatory woes and detention of its officials, Binance has delisted the naira from its P2P platform in the country.

The only way to resolve its issues will be by submitting itself to unobstructed investigation and judicial due process.\n\n\"The government of Nigeria will continue to act within its laws and international norms and will not succumb to any form of blackmail from any entity, local or foreign,\" the statement added.\n\nOn Tuesday May 7, Nairametrics reported that the CEO of Binance, Richard Teng, alleged that some unknown persons sought a bribe of cryptocurrency from its executives, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, before their detention on February 28, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "nairametrics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nairametrics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cyrus_ademola@nairametrics.com", "name": "Cyrus Ademola", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blackmail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_financing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism financing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nation state"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Untitled-design.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 2916, "textEnd": 2921}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Anjarwalla subsequently escaped and has been traced to Kenya.\n\nGambaryan has been held in Kuje Correctional Facility in the last four weeks, after he was transferred there from a safe house on April 8.\n\nBoth Binance and Gambaryan are facing trial for tax evasion and money laundering.\n\nTheir trial was scheduled to begin last Thursday, but the court postponed it until May 17.\n\nGambaryan reportedly wrote a three-page report describing the payment request and gave it to Binance's lawyers, two people familiar with the report told NYT.\n\nHe also reportedly alerted contacts in the Nigerian government and recounted the incident to them.\n\nBinance had denied that Gambaryan had any \"decision-making power\" in the company.\n\nThe case is the latest legal headache for Binance, which agreed to a $4.3bn fine last year to settle charges by the US government that it allowed criminal activity to flourish on its platform.\n\nIn April, the company's founder, Changpeng Zhao, was sentenced to four months in prison for his role in those violations.\n\nThe spokesman for the ONSA, Zakari Mijinyawa, said in a text message to NYT that the Federal Government would make its case \"on the strength of the facts and evidence, in accordance with due process.\"\n\n\"We are confident that Nigeria has a good case. Binance equally will have every opportunity under the rule of law to make its case and see justice delivered,\" Mijinyawa said.\n\nIn his post, Teng laid out the history of Binance's engagement with Nigeria, which has become a hotspot for the crypto industry.\n\nIt has the second-highest rate of crypto adoption in the world behind India, according to Chainalysis, a data firm.\n\nIn 2023, the financial regulators issued a statement directing Binance to stop soliciting investors in Nigeria.\n\nBinance halted its advertising in the country and offered to meet with government officials, Teng said.\n\nOn January 8, Teng said Gambaryan and a group of Binance employees met with lawmakers, but the meeting was contentious\n\nThe lawmakers, he wrote, read aloud a list of accusations against Binance, including tax violations.\n\nThey also threatened to pursue an arrest warrant for Teng, the article said.\n\nAs the Binance employees left the meeting, Teng wrote they were approached by \"unknown persons\" who suggested that they make a payment to settle the allegations.\n\nLater, a local lawyer representing Binance spoke with someone purporting to be an agent of the House committee, Teng further claimed in his article, adding that the purported agent demanded \"a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away,\"\n\nThe amount was roughly $150m, four people familiar with the matter said, according to a Bloomberg report, quoting NYT sources.\n\n\"Our team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed. We, of course, declined the payment demand via our counsel, not viewing it to be a legitimate settlement offer,\" Teng wrote in his post.\n\nTeng claimed that Binance had received assurances that Gambaryan would be safe if he returned to Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, a company adviser with deep local connections recommended that Binance officials meet with the ONSA.\n\nHowever, a prosecutor with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ekele Iheanacho, dismissed Teng's allegation, vowing to prosecute the case to the end.\n\nIheanacho, one of the lawyers prosecuting the Binance officials, said, ''Nobody demanded any money, the case is being taken to a logical conclusion. He's making it up although I am not aware of any such allegations. As far as I am concerned, the charges are going on and we are making every effort to ensure that we get to a logical end.''\n\nThe Media Adviser to the Attorney-General of the Federation, Kamarudeen Ogundele, directed inquiries to the information minister and the Presidency.\n\nHe said \"You can call the minister of information or president's spokesperson. This allegation is not court-related. It is not an allegation against the Attorney-General of the Federation.\n\nThe information minister, Mohammed Idris, could not be reached for comment as calls to his phone rang out.\n\nBut senior officials, who spoke in separate interviews with The PUNCH on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk about the matter, dared the Binance boss to reveal the names of individuals who demanded the bribe.\n\nA top official in the ONSA, who is close to the probe, said, \"Did he (Binance CEO) mention a name? Since he didn't mention a name, why should anyone be worried? Why should anyone waste their time if somebody made an unfounded allegation but could not mention any name?\"\n\nA top EFCC chief, who is close to the trial, also said, \"If someone would say something like this, he should have the capacity to mention the people. It's not worth our time, anybody can say anything but as long as they can't substantiate it, it's a waste of time. He should mention names, if not, all that he's saying is rubbish.\"\n\nTwo top officials at the EFCC accused the Binance CEO of blackmailing the Federal Government.\n\nThey noted that Teng's claim was frivolous, describing his action as ''the modus operandi of foreign personalities and corporations facing legal charges in Nigeria and other African countries.''\n\nOne of the sources noted, \"It is not only the EFCC that is prosecuting or investigating Binance over its atrocities against Nigeria. There are allegations of money laundering, and tax evasion, amongst others, against the company, and several federal government agencies are probing the company's activities in the country.\n\n\"But the latest comment about alleged request for bribery by the Binance CEO is a blackmail against the Federal Government. That is the modus operandi of international corporations and individuals facing charges in Nigeria or anywhere else in Africa.\"\n\nA senior official noted, \"It is the tradition of these international players to blackmail the country whenever they're caught. What is the correlation between the alleged request for bribes and the allegations brought against Binance?\n\n\"The facts are there - they evaded tax, their platform is being used to launder money, so why are they not facing the facts? The claim is frivolous and a mere blackmail against the government.\"\n\nThe spokesperson for ONSA, Mijinyawa, could not be reached for comments on Tuesday. He did not respond to calls and a message sent to his phone.\n\nThe spokesperson for the EFCC, Dele Oyewale, declined comment.\n\nCommenting on the development, the Executive Director of the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Auwal Musa Ibrahim, said he wasn't surprised by the allegation, noting the bad reputation of Nigeria's administrative justice system.\n\nHe urged the CEO to \"be bold enough\" to name persons and organisations involved in the alleged demand for bribes so that they could be dealt with decisively.\n\n''This allegation is not enough, it should be investigated and let Nigerians know those undermining their country's integrity. The (Binance) CEO should be bold enough to mention those individuals or corporate organisations that have demanded bribes on this matter.\n\n''This is important in order not to make frivolous accusations and to also deal decisively with these public officials who always mortgage this country. So, we urge him to be courageous and bold enough to also mention those individuals, those organisations, those government officials, if at all they were involved\", he said\n\nSimilarly, the Chairman of the Centre for Accountability and Open Leadership, Debo Adeniran, said Binance should be compelled to name the alleged persons so they can be prosecuted.\n\nHe added that the officials who allowed the Binance executive to slip out of the country should be equally investigated.\n\n\"Binance should be compelled to name names, and everyone involved should be prosecuted and punished. All the agencies involved in the Binance case; DSS, NIA, DMI, Immigration Services, which let him slip out of Nigeria should be investigated and culpable offenders should be prosecuted and given deterrent punishment,'' he suggested.\n\nBinance did not respond to email queries to provide clarity and insight on the 'unknown persons' who suggested making payment to settle the allegations.\n\nThe crypto exchange did not also respond to how much the 'unknown persons' requested.", "source": {"uri": "nigerianeye.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nigerianeye"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

However, Gambaryan, who heads Binance's anti-crime efforts, remains imprisoned at Kuje Prison in Abuja for the last four weeks.\n\nBinance CEO Richard Teng released a statement detailing the company's interactions with Nigerian officials. Here are the key takeaways:\n\nBinance denies wrongdoing and is challenging the accusations.

Anjarwalla subsequently escaped and has been traced to Kenya.\n\nGambaryan has been held in Kuje Correctional Facility in the last four weeks, after he was transferred there from a safe house on April 8.\n\nSee Also: Tinubu's Administration Demanded $150 Million Bribe To Make 'Illegal' Nigeria Charges Go Away: Binance CEO\n\nBoth Binance and Gambaryan are facing trial for tax evasion and money laundering.\n\nTheir trial was scheduled to begin last Thursday, but the court postponed it until May 17.\n\nGambaryan reportedly wrote a three-page report describing the payment request and gave it to Binance's lawyers, two people familiar with the report told NYT.\n\nHe also reportedly alerted contacts in the Nigerian government and recounted the incident to them.\n\nBinance had denied that Gambaryan had any \"decision-making power\" in the company.\n\nThe case is the latest legal headache for Binance, which agreed to a $4.3bn fine last year to settle charges by the US government that it allowed criminal activity to flourish on its platform.\n\nIn April, the company's founder, Changpeng Zhao, was sentenced to four months in prison for his role in those violations.\n\nThe spokesman for the ONSA, Zakari Mijinyawa, said in a text message to NYT that the Federal Government would make its case \"on the strength of the facts and evidence, in accordance with due process.\"\n\n\"We are confident that Nigeria has a good case. Binance equally will have every opportunity under the rule of law to make its case and see justice delivered,\" Mijinyawa said.\n\nIn his post, Teng laid out the history of Binance's engagement with Nigeria, which has become a hotspot for the crypto industry.\n\nIt has the second-highest rate of crypto adoption in the world behind India, according to Chainalysis, a data firm.\n\nIn 2023, the financial regulators issued a statement directing Binance to stop soliciting investors in Nigeria.\n\nBinance halted its advertising in the country and offered to meet with government officials, Teng said.\n\nOn January 8, Teng said Gambaryan and a group of Binance employees met with lawmakers, but the meeting was contentious\n\nThe lawmakers, he wrote, read aloud a list of accusations against Binance, including tax violations.\n\nAs the Binance employees left the meeting, Teng wrote they were approached by \"unknown persons\" who suggested that they make a payment to settle the allegations.\n\nLater, a local lawyer representing Binance spoke with someone purporting to be an agent of the House committee, Teng further claimed in his article, adding that the purported agent demanded \"a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away.\"\n\nThe amount was roughly $150m, four people familiar with the matter said, according to a Bloomberg report, quoting NYT sources.\n\nSee Also: Flying Pepe (FLYPEPE) to Surge 6,800% Ahead of MEXC Listing, as Bonk and Dogecoin Lag\n\n\"Our team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed. We, of course, declined the payment demand via our counsel, not viewing it to be a legitimate settlement offer,\" Teng wrote in his post.\n\nTeng claimed that Binance had received assurances that Gambaryan would be safe if he returned to Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, a company adviser with deep local connections recommended that Binance officials meet with the ONSA.\n\nHowever, a prosecutor with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ekele Iheanacho, dismissed Teng's allegation, vowing to prosecute the case to the end.\n\nIheanacho, one of the lawyers prosecuting the Binance officials, said, ''Nobody demanded any money, the case is being taken to a logical conclusion. He's making it up although I am not aware of any such allegations. As far as I am concerned, the charges are going on and we are making every effort to ensure that we get to a logical end.''\n\nThe Media Adviser to the Attorney-General of the Federation, Kamarudeen Ogundele, directed inquiries to the information minister and the Presidency.\n\nHe said \"You can call the minister of information or president's spokesperson. This allegation is not court-related. It is not an allegation against the Attorney-General of the Federation.\n\nThe information minister, Mohammed Idris, could not be reached for comment as calls to his phone rang out.\n\nBut senior officials, who spoke in separate interviews with The PUNCH on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk about the matter, dared the Binance boss to reveal the names of individuals who demanded the bribe.\n\nA top official in the ONSA, who is close to the probe, said, \"Did he (Binance CEO) mention a name? Since he didn't mention a name, why should anyone be worried? Why should anyone waste their time if somebody made an unfounded allegation but could not mention any name?\"\n\nA top EFCC chief, who is close to the trial, also said, \"If someone would say something like this, he should have the capacity to mention the people. It's not worth our time, anybody can say anything but as long as they can't substantiate it, it's a waste of time. He should mention names, if not, all that he's saying is rubbish.\"\n\nTwo top officials at the EFCC accused the Binance CEO of blackmailing the Federal Government.\n\nThey noted that Teng's claim was frivolous, describing his action as \"the modus operandi of foreign personalities and corporations facing legal charges in Nigeria and other African countries.\"\n\nOne of the sources noted, \"It is not only the EFCC that is prosecuting or investigating Binance over its atrocities against Nigeria. There are allegations of money laundering, and tax evasion, amongst others, against the company, and several federal government agencies are probing the company's activities in the country.\n\n\"But the latest comment about an alleged request for bribery by the Binance CEO is a blackmail against the Federal Government. That is the modus operandi of international corporations and individuals facing charges in Nigeria or anywhere else in Africa.\"\n\nA senior official noted, \"It is the tradition of these international players to blackmail the country whenever they're caught. What is the correlation between the alleged request for bribes and the allegations brought against Binance?\n\n\"The facts are there - they evaded tax, their platform is being used to launder money, so why are they not facing the facts? The claim is frivolous and a mere blackmail against the government.\"\n\nThe spokesperson for ONSA, Mijinyawa, could not be reached for comments on Tuesday. He did not respond to calls and a message sent to his phone.\n\nThe spokesperson for the EFCC, Dele Oyewale, declined comment.\n\nCommenting on the development, the Executive Director of the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Auwal Musa Ibrahim, said he wasn't surprised by the allegation, noting the bad reputation of Nigeria's administrative justice system.\n\nHe urged the CEO to \"be bold enough\" to name persons and organisations involved in the alleged demand for bribes so that they could be dealt with decisively.\n\n\"This allegation is not enough, it should be investigated and let Nigerians know those undermining their country's integrity. The (Binance) CEO should be bold enough to mention those individuals or corporate organisations that have demanded bribes on this matter.\n\n\"This is important in order not to make frivolous accusations and to also deal decisively with these public officials who always mortgage this country. So, we urge him to be courageous and bold enough to also mention those individuals, those organisations, those government officials, if at all they were involved\", he said\n\nSimilarly, the Chairman of the Centre for Accountability and Open Leadership, Debo Adeniran, said Binance should be compelled to name the alleged persons so they can be prosecuted.\n\nHe added that the officials who allowed the Binance executive to slip out of the country should be equally investigated.\n\n\"Binance should be compelled to name names, and everyone involved should be prosecuted and punished. All the agencies involved in the Binance case; DSS, NIA, DMI, Immigration Services, which let him slip out of Nigeria should be investigated and culpable offenders should be prosecuted and given deterrent punishment,'' he suggested.\n\nBinance did not respond to email queries to provide clarity and insight on the 'unknown persons' who suggested making payment to settle the allegations.\n\nThe crypto exchange did not also respond to how much the 'unknown persons' requested.", "source": {"uri": "bitcoinik.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bitcoinik"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On Tuesday, Richard Teng shared his concerns about the country's crackdown on the platform and its executives.\n\nIn a Binance Blog post, the CEO discussed the timeline of the Binance vs Nigeria saga from the exchange's point of view. Teng \" provided the facts so that the global community's perception may not be distorted unfairly.\"\n\nMy friend and colleague, Tigran Gambaryan, has been unlawfully detained by the Nigerian government for more than 70 days. We're tirelessly working to #BringTigranHome.\n\nFor the first time publicly, I'm sharing the full context of this situation here. https://t.co/Rg3DEYJZgW\n\n-- Richard Teng (@_RichardTeng) May 7, 2024\n\nAccording to the detailed timeline, this saga began in 2022, when Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published new regulations requiring crypto exchanges operating in the country to obtain SEC permits and comply with specific requirements.\n\nThe exchange claims to have \"proactively reached out\" several times seeking practical guidance. However, the Nigerian regulator allegedly did not respond to Binance's questions. Teng argues that \"no Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) has been licensed under the new regulations to this date.\"\n\nIn early January 2024, Binance employees finally met with the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) and agreed to share a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The MoU would set out the proposed terms and conditions for sharing anti-money laundering (AML)-related information.\n\nThe exchange representatives went through other meetings, including one with the House Committee on Financial Crimes (HCFC) members. Teng claims that as the Binance employees left the meeting, they were approached by \"unknown persons who suggested to them to make a payment in settlement of the allegations.\"\n\nHowever, the CEO alleges that the team was not informed of the accusations' details despite repeatedly requesting them.\n\nMoreover, Binance's local counsel was presented with a \"demand for a significant payment in cryptocurrency\" within the next 48 hours. The \"settlement\" would \"make the issues go away.\"\n\nAs a result, Binance representatives departed the country and declined the payment demand. The exchange considered the payment a non-legitimate settlement offer and clarified through its local counsel that it would engage in settlement negotiations under a set of conditions.\n\nAs of this writing, Nigeria has denied Binance's claim of bribery.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Binance CEO Richard Teng accused Nigerian officials of demanding a $150 million cryptocurrency payment to resolve a criminal investigation facing the company. The Nigerian government has denied Binance's accusations that its officials solicited bribes....\n\n-- Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 8, 2024\n\nIs Nigeria's Crackdown Setting A Dangerous Precedent?\n\nIn February, the exchange's local advisors suggested having a reunion with the director of the Office of National Security Advisor (ONSA). The meeting was scheduled for February 26, and the security of the exchanges' representatives was assured.\n\nNonetheless, it was during this reunion that Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were taken \"as guests\" by Nigerian authorities and \"were accused personally of holding responsibility for the state of the naira and the overall economy, and allegations of terrorist financing and money laundering.\"\n\nIn the post, the CEO shared Gambaryan's efforts to combat finance crime throughout his career. Teng highlighted that the now-detained executive has assisted global law enforcement in freezing and seizing more than $2 billion worth of assets with his financial Crime Compliance Team just in 2022 and 2023.\n\nDespite knowing about the risks and the growing tension, Gambaryan traveled to Nigeria as a representative of Binance. However, the executive didn't go as a \"decision-maker, nor a negotiator.\" He went \"as a functional expert in financial crime and capacity building in policy discussions,\" as Teng clarifies.\n\nPer the post, Gambaryan's situation \"went from bad to worse\" after Anjarwalla escaped from Nigerian custody at the end of March. The CEO alleges that during a bail hearing on April 25, the EFCC's prosecutor stated that since \"The 1st defendant [Binance] is operating virtually. The only thing we have to hold on to is this defendant [Tigran].\"\n\nAccording to Teng, the Nigerian government is sending a clear message: an innocent employee \"must be\" detained and placed in a \"dangerous prison in order to control Binance.\"\n\nUltimately, the CEO considers inviting mid-level employees under pretenses only to detain them \"has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide.\"", "source": {"uri": "cryptodaily.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "cryptodaily.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_of_understanding", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Memorandum of understanding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuse of power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_financing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism financing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Financial_Crimes_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic and Financial Crimes Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Routers_and_Routing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Routers and Routing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Clearing_Houses_and_Securities_Depositories", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Clearing Houses and Securities Depositories", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Barter", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-26", "textStart": 3530, "textEnd": 3541}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 4686, "textEnd": 4694}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Anjarwalla subsequently escaped and has been traced to Kenya.\n\nGambaryan has been held in Kuje Correctional Facility in the last four weeks, after he was transferred there from a safe house on April 8.\n\nBoth Binance and Gambaryan are facing trial for tax evasion and money laundering.\n\nTheir trial was scheduled to begin last Thursday, but the court postponed it until May 17.\n\nGambaryan reportedly wrote a three-page report describing the payment request and gave it to Binance's lawyers, two people familiar with the report told NYT.\n\nHe also reportedly alerted contacts in the Nigerian government and recounted the incident to them.\n\nBinance had denied that Gambaryan had any \"decision-making power\" in the company.\n\nThe case is the latest legal headache for Binance, which agreed to a $4.3bn fine last year to settle charges by the US government that it allowed criminal activity to flourish on its platform.\n\nIn April, the company's founder, Changpeng Zhao, was sentenced to four months in prison for his role in those violations.\n\nThe spokesman for the ONSA, Zakari Mijinyawa, said in a text message to NYT that the Federal Government would make its case \"on the strength of the facts and evidence, in accordance with due process.\"\n\n\"We are confident that Nigeria has a good case. Binance equally will have every opportunity under the rule of law to make its case and see justice delivered,\" Mijinyawa said.\n\nIn his post, Teng laid out the history of Binance's engagement with Nigeria, which has become a hotspot for the crypto industry.\n\nIt has the second-highest rate of crypto adoption in the world behind India, according to Chainalysis, a data firm.\n\nIn 2023, the financial regulators issued a statement directing Binance to stop soliciting investors in Nigeria.\n\nBinance halted its advertising in the country and offered to meet with government officials, Teng said.\n\nOn January 8, Teng said Gambaryan and a group of Binance employees met with lawmakers, but the meeting was contentious\n\nThe lawmakers, he wrote, read aloud a list of accusations against Binance, including tax violations.\n\nThey also threatened to pursue an arrest warrant for Teng, the article said.\n\nAs the Binance employees left the meeting, Teng wrote they were approached by \"unknown persons\" who suggested that they make a payment to settle the allegations.\n\nLater, a local lawyer representing Binance spoke with someone purporting to be an agent of the House committee, Teng further claimed in his article, adding that the purported agent demanded \"a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away,\"\n\nThe amount was roughly $150m, four people familiar with the matter said, according to a Bloomberg report, quoting NYT sources.\n\n\"Our team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed. We, of course, declined the payment demand via our counsel, not viewing it to be a legitimate settlement offer,\" Teng wrote in his post.\n\nTeng claimed that Binance had received assurances that Gambaryan would be safe if he returned to Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, a company adviser with deep local connections recommended that Binance officials meet with the ONSA.\n\nEFCC dismisses allegation\n\nHowever, a prosecutor with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ekele Iheanacho, dismissed Teng's allegation, vowing to prosecute the case to the end.\n\nIheanacho, one of the lawyers prosecuting the Binance officials, said, ''Nobody demanded any money, the case is being taken to a logical conclusion. He's making it up although I am not aware of any such allegations. As far as I am concerned, the charges are going on and we are making every effort to ensure that we get to a logical end.''\n\nThe Media Adviser to the Attorney-General of the Federation, Kamarudeen Ogundele, directed inquiries to the information minister and the Presidency.\n\nHe said \"You can call the minister of information or president's spokesperson. This allegation is not court-related. It is not an allegation against the Attorney-General of the Federation.\n\nThe information minister, Mohammed Idris, could not be reached for comment as calls to his phone rang out.\n\nBut senior officials, who spoke in separate interviews with The PUNCH on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk about the matter, dared the Binance boss to reveal the names of individuals who demanded the bribe.\n\nA top official in the ONSA, who is close to the probe, said, \"Did he (Binance CEO) mention a name? Since he didn't mention a name, why should anyone be worried? Why should anyone waste their time if somebody made an unfounded allegation but could not mention any name?\"\n\nA top EFCC chief, who is close to the trial, also said, \"If someone would say something like this, he should have the capacity to mention the people. It's not worth our time, anybody can say anything but as long as they can't substantiate it, it's a waste of time. He should mention names, if not, all that he's saying is rubbish.\"\n\nTwo top officials at the EFCC accused the Binance CEO of blackmailing the Federal Government.\n\nThey noted that Teng's claim was frivolous, describing his action as ''the modus operandi of foreign personalities and corporations facing legal charges in Nigeria and other African countries.''\n\nOne of the sources noted, \"It is not only the EFCC that is prosecuting or investigating Binance over its atrocities against Nigeria. There are allegations of money laundering, and tax evasion, amongst others, against the company, and several federal government agencies are probing the company's activities in the country.\n\n\"But the latest comment about alleged request for bribery by the Binance CEO is a blackmail against the Federal Government. That is the modus operandi of international corporations and individuals facing charges in Nigeria or anywhere else in Africa.\"\n\nA senior official noted, \"It is the tradition of these international players to blackmail the country whenever they're caught. What is the correlation between the alleged request for bribes and the allegations brought against Binance?\n\n\"The facts are there - they evaded tax, their platform is being used to launder money, so why are they not facing the facts? The claim is frivolous and a mere blackmail against the government.\"\n\nThe spokesperson for ONSA, Mijinyawa, could not be reached for comments on Tuesday. He did not respond to calls and a message sent to his phone.\n\nThe spokesperson for the EFCC, Dele Oyewale, declined comment.\n\nCSOs react\n\nCommenting on the development, the Executive Director of the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Auwal Musa Ibrahim, said he wasn't surprised by the allegation, noting the bad reputation of Nigeria's administrative justice system.\n\nHe urged the CEO to \"be bold enough\" to name persons and organisations involved in the alleged demand for bribes so that they could be dealt with decisively.\n\n''This allegation is not enough, it should be investigated and let Nigerians know those undermining their country's integrity. The (Binance) CEO should be bold enough to mention those individuals or corporate organisations that have demanded bribes on this matter.\n\n''This is important in order not to make frivolous accusations and to also deal decisively with these public officials who always mortgage this country. So, we urge him to be courageous and bold enough to also mention those individuals, those organisations, those government officials, if at all they were involved\", he said\n\nSimilarly, the Chairman of the Centre for Accountability and Open Leadership, Debo Adeniran, said Binance should be compelled to name the alleged persons so they can be prosecuted.\n\nHe added that the officials who allowed the Binance executive to slip out of the country should be equally investigated.\n\n\"Binance should be compelled to name names, and everyone involved should be prosecuted and punished. All the agencies involved in the Binance case; DSS, NIA, DMI, Immigration Services, which let him slip out of Nigeria should be investigated and culpable offenders should be prosecuted and given deterrent punishment,'' he suggested.\n\nBinance did not respond to email queries to provide clarity and insight on the 'unknown persons' who suggested making payment to settle the allegations.\n\nThe

This move by the Nigerian authorities has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide, Teng said in his statement.\n\nArrest of Executives Sets Dangerous Precedent\n\nIn the latest blog post, the Binance CEO said Gambaryan didn't travel to Nigeria to make decisions or negotiate. He was there solely as an expert in financial crime, contributing to policy discussions and capacity building. Teng said the arrests were made despite Nigerian authorities' assurances that they would be granted safe passage for their meetings.\n\nApart from Gambaryan, the exchange's African regional manager, Nadeem Anjarwalla, was also arrested in February after arriving for a meeting that involved the SEC CEO, the deputy governor of the central bank, and the national security adviser, as reported by Teng.\n\n\"Let Tigran go home to his family, and then Binance will work through the same process that we have done with Nigeria's law enforcement community voluntarily more than 600 times in the past.

We will work tirelessly with public and private partners to remove them.\"\n\nTen further affirmed that Binance will continue engagement with Nigeria's Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to resolve potential historic tax liabilities.\n\nHow Did The Arrests Unfold?\n\nBinance reportedly took proactive steps, reaching out to Nigeria's SEC multiple times to seek guidance and offering to collaborate with local authorities for consultation in 2022\n\nThe following year, the SEC issued a cease and desist order against the exchange. However, the circular targeted \"Binance Nigeria Limited,\" a separate entity not affiliated with Binance. Despite this, Binance suspended all solicitation activities in the African country. While Teng acknowledged that the firm repeatedly sought to cooperate with the SEC, it received no response from the regulator.\n\nBinance employees, including Gambaryan, traveled to Nigeria for a rescheduled public hearing on January 10. They met with the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) and the House Committee on Financial Crimes (HCFC) in pre-hearing meetings, demanding responses to allegations.\n\nBinance hadn't received these allegations and proposed written responses, declining a settlement offer for clear terms, no public hearing, and employee safety.\n\nGambaryan and Anjarwalla were detained during a public hearing and were accused of Nigeria's economic issues and terrorism financing. They were moved to a high-security compound after seizing their passports. While Binance agreed to delist the naira for their release, Gambaryan still remains detained.\n\nThe Binance CEO said that the Nigerian government's actions suggest its conspiracy to control Binance through Gambaryan's detention despite the exchange's actions such as suspending Nigerian naira trading and P2P services, as well as repeated attempts to engage with authorities.\n\nAnjarwalla was released on March 23, but Gambaryan remains detained.

enforcement training for the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) and Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nIn December 2023, Binance received a request from the House Committee on Financial Crimes (HCFC) to appear at a public investigative hearing.\n\nIn February 2024, Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, head of Binance Africa, traveled to Nigeria for meetings with government representatives, receiving assurances of safe passage.\n\nHowever, during the meetings, Nigerian officials demanded that Binance delist the naira from its platform, provide user information, and comply with financial/tax requirements.\n\nGambaryan and Anjarwalla were then detained and moved to a secure compound, with their passports and mobile phones confiscated.\n\nBinance responded by removing the naira pairing from its platform and shutting down the P2P product for Nigeria, hoping for the release of its employees.\n\nHowever, Gambaryan remains in detention, with Nigerian officials stating that they are holding him as leverage against Binance.\n\nTeng expressed his distress over the situation and reiterated Binance's commitment to working with global regulators and enforcement agencies to uphold the integrity of the global financial system.\n\nHe highlighted the company's efforts to restructure its organization, upgrade systems, and appoint new leadership with deep compliance experience.\n\nThe CEO called for Gambaryan's immediate release, emphasizing that Binance is willing to work with the Nigerian government to resolve any further concerns and address potential historic tax liabilities.\n\nHe urged the Nigerian government to allow Gambaryan to return home to his family and expressed hope for a future where Binance can work alongside the Nigerian government to build a strong economy for the Nigerian people.", "source": {"uri": "blockonomi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blockonomi"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_dale@blockonomi.com",

\"dangerous precedent\" for companies globally. has labelled the detention of the company's executives in Nigeria as a \"dangerous precedent\" for companies globally.\n\nTeng, who spoke to Reuters on Tuesday, said it was time to break the silence on the ongoing detention of Tigran Gambaryan, a U.S. citizen and Binance head of financial crime compliance.\n\nBinance and two of its executives, Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, are facing individual trials on charges of tax evasion and money laundering, which the firm is challenging.\n\nAnjarwalla escaped a lawful custody, and \"fled Nigeria using a smuggled passport\", the office of Nigeria's National Security Adviser said in a statement.\n\nOn his part, Binance CEO said the executives first held meetings with Nigerian authorities in the country in January 2024.\n\nHe said on February 26, the Nigerian authorities at a follow-up meeting said the issues involving Binance were of national security and demanded that the exchange delist the naira currency from its platform and provide \"granular-level\" details on all Nigerian users.\n\nTeng stated that Gambaryan had been detained in Nigeria for over two months \"on dubious grounds.\"\n\nIn early March, Binance declared that it was halting all transactions and trading in naira.\n\nHe stated that Gambaryan should be permitted to return home while Binance and Nigerian authorities settle any disputes.\n\nOn February 28, Nairametrics reported that Nigeria officials detained two senior Binance executives: Nadeem Anjarwalla, a 37-year-old British-Kenyan who serves as the regional manager for Africa, and Tigran Gambaryan, a 39-year-old American in charge of financial crime compliance at Binance.\n\nThe executives visited Nigeria in response to the country's recent crackdown on various cryptocurrency trading platforms.\n\nDuring their stay, they were apprehended by the Office of the National Security Adviser and their passports were confiscated.\n\nIn response to the detention of its executives, Binance discontinued the trading of the naira against bitcoin and tether cryptocurrencies on its exchange.\n\nMeanwhile, on March 24, a statement from the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) confirmed that one of the executives, Anjarwalla subsequently escaped from lawful custody.\n\nThe Briton, who also has Kenyan citizenship, is believed to have flown out of Abuja using a Middle East airliner.\n\nIt remains unclear how Mr Anjarwalla got on an international flight despite his British passport, with which he entered Nigeria, remaining in the custody of the Nigerian authorities.\n\nHowever, the Federal Government said it is discussing with Interpol to secure an international arrest warrant for Anjarwalla and extradite him to Nigeria.\n\nCurrently, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) in Abuja filed legal proceedings against the cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, alleging four instances of tax evasion.\n\nThe allegation against Binance involves the non-remittance of Value Added Tax (VAT), Company Income tax (CIT), non-compliance with tax return filing obligations, and facilitating tax evasion for its users.\n\nFurthermore, in the lawsuit, the Federal Government charged Binance with not registering for tax purposes with the FIRS and violating the country's tax laws.", "source": {"uri":

The detention was due to allegations leveled against Binance for making illegal-transaction profits in the country, with criminal charges filed against the pair on February 28. Anjarwalla later escaped from custody on March 22.\n\nIn a blog post published Tuesday, Teng expressed concern over the precedent set by inviting mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings and subsequently detaining them, calling it \"a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide.\"\n\nTeng emphasized Gambaryan's professional background as a former US IRS Special Agent and his efforts in assisting global law enforcement to freeze and seize more than $2.2 billion in assets since joining Binance in 2021.\n\nTeng also highlighted a statement made by a prosecutor for Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) during Gambaryan's bail hearing on April 25, which implied that the government was using the employee's detention as leverage against Binance. \"The message from the Nigerian government is clear: we must detain an innocent, mid-level employee and a former US federal agent, and place him in a dangerous prison in order to control Binance,\" Teng stated.\n\nThe Binance CEO, who took over from Changpeng Zhao in November, pledged to work with global regulators and enforcement agencies, restructuring the organization and bringing in new leadership with compliance experience. In November, Zhao pleaded guilty in the US for failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program, with Binance agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in one of the largest corporate settlements in history.\n\nTeng outlined the events leading up to the current situation, beginning with Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission issuing digital asset regulations in May 2022. Despite Binance's attempts to comply, the exchange faced unclear requirements and non-responsiveness from the SEC.\n\nIn June 2023, the US SEC accused Binance of operating illegally, prompting the exchange to suspend the solicitation of Nigerian investors.\n\nIn an effort to address concerns about Binance's role in Nigeria's currency crisis, Teng made the decision to turn off the exchange's P2P product and end the trading of all naira pairs on the spot exchange product for Nigeria. However, this action did not result in the release of the detained employees.\n\nTeng asked the Nigerian regulators to allow Gambaryan to return home to his family. After that, Binance promised would work with Nigeria's law enforcement and the Federal Inland Revenue Service to remove \"bad actors\" from its platform and resolve potential tax liabilities.", "source": {"uri": "cryptobriefing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crypto Briefing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vince_dioquino@cryptobriefing.com", "name": "Vince Dioquino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Financial_Crimes_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic and Financial Crimes Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changpeng_Zhao", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Changpeng Zhao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peer-to-peer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/07070957/img-9Ky5ps3rdMPmGxVa4MDDcQPN-800x457.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-26", "textStart": 417, "textEnd": 428}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-28", "textStart": 627, "textEnd": 638}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-22", "textStart": 681, "textEnd": 689}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 1314, "textEnd": 1322}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

On Tuesday, Richard Teng shared his concerns about the country's crackdown on the platform and its executives.\n\nIn a Binance Blog post, the CEO discussed the timeline of the Binance vs Nigeria saga from the exchange's point of view. Teng \" provided the facts so that the global community's perception may not be distorted unfairly.\"\n\nAccording to the detailed timeline, this saga began in 2022, when Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published new regulations requiring crypto exchanges operating in the country to obtain SEC permits and comply with specific requirements.\n\nThe exchange claims to have \"proactively reached out\" several times seeking practical guidance. However, the Nigerian regulator allegedly did not respond to Binance's questions. Teng argues that \"no Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) has been licensed under the new regulations to this date.\"\n\nIn early January 2024, Binance employees finally met with the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) and agreed to share a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The MoU would set out the proposed terms and conditions for sharing anti-money laundering (AML)-related information.\n\nThe exchange representatives went through other meetings, including one with the House Committee on Financial Crimes (HCFC) members. Teng claims that as the Binance employees left the meeting, they were approached by \"unknown persons who suggested to them to make a payment in settlement of the allegations.\"\n\nHowever, the CEO alleges that the team was not informed of the accusations' details despite repeatedly requesting them.\n\nMoreover, Binance's local counsel was presented with a \"demand for a significant payment in cryptocurrency\" within the next 48 hours. The \"settlement\" would \"make the issues go away.\"\n\nAs a result, Binance representatives departed the country and declined the payment demand. The exchange considered the payment a non-legitimate settlement offer and clarified through its local counsel that it would engage in settlement negotiations under a set of conditions.\n\nAs of this writing, Nigeria has denied Binance's claim of bribery.\n\nIs Nigeria's Crackdown Setting A Dangerous Precedent?\n\nIn February, the exchange's local advisors suggested having a reunion with the director of the Office of National Security Advisor (ONSA). The meeting was scheduled for February 26, and the security of the exchanges' representatives was assured.\n\nNonetheless, it was during this reunion that Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were taken \"as guests\" by Nigerian authorities and \"were accused personally of holding responsibility for the state of the naira and the overall economy, and allegations of terrorist financing and money laundering.\"\n\nIn the post, the CEO shared Gambaryan's efforts to combat finance crime throughout his career. Teng highlighted that the now-detained executive has assisted global law enforcement in freezing and seizing more than $2 billion worth of assets with his financial Crime Compliance Team just in 2022 and 2023.\n\nDespite knowing about the risks and the growing tension, Gambaryan traveled to Nigeria as a representative of Binance. However, the executive didn't go as a \"decision-maker, nor a negotiator.\" He went \"as a functional expert in financial crime and capacity building in policy discussions,\" as Teng clarifies.\n\nPer the post, Gambaryan's situation \"went from bad to worse\" after Anjarwalla escaped from Nigerian custody at the end of March. The CEO alleges that during a bail hearing on April 25, the EFCC's prosecutor stated that since \"The 1st defendant [Binance] is operating virtually. The only thing we have to hold on to is this defendant [Tigran].\"\n\nAccording to Teng, the Nigerian government is sending a clear message: an innocent employee \"must be\" detained and placed in a \"dangerous prison in order to control Binance.\"\n\nUltimately, the CEO considers inviting mid-level employees under pretenses only to detain them \"has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide.\"", "source": {"uri": "bitcoinist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bitcoinist.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rubmar_garcia@bitcoinist.com", "name": "Rubmar Garcia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_of_understanding", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Memorandum of understanding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuse of power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_financing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism financing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Financial_Crimes_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic and Financial Crimes Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Routers_and_Routing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Routers and Routing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Clearing_Houses_and_Securities_Depositories", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Clearing Houses and Securities Depositories", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Barter", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/vadim-artyukhin-_92BitC3QEU-unsplash.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-26", "textStart": 2882, "textEnd": 2893}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 4038, "textEnd": 4046}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

It is nothing but a diversionary tactic.\"\n\nThe cryptocurrency giant did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTeng's blog was the latest chapter in an increasingly sharp confrontation with Nigeria that's already seen the crypto platform blocked and two Binance employees detained in the country.\n\nOne managed to escape while the other, Tigran Gambaryan, remains in custody on charges of tax evasion, currency speculation and money laundering. His trial is scheduled to begin this month.\n\nTeng said in his blog that the company attended a meeting with Nigerian officials in Abuja, the capital, in early January at which it was confronted with criminal allegations.\n\nHe said Binance staff were approached by \"unknown persons\" for a payment to settle the allegations as they left the meeting. The company's lawyer was subsequently \"presented with a demand for a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away,\" he wrote.\n\nThe Binance chief said that Gambaryan and his colleague, Nadeem Anjarwalla, returned to Nigeria in late February at the invitation of the authorities, after being assured of their safe passage. Notwithstanding those promises, they were quickly arrested.\n\n\"The phantom bribe claim is part of an orchestrated international campaign by this company that is facing criminal prosecution in many countries including the US, to undermine the Nigerian government,\" Ibrahim said. \"It will not clear its name in Nigeria by resorting to fictional claims and mudslinging media campaigns.\"\n\nOn top of its problems in Nigeria, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao was ordered on April 30 to spend four months in prison in the US for failures that allowed cybercriminals and terrorist groups to freely trade on its platform. Binance in November agreed to pay $4.3 billion to resolve the US allegations.\n\nNaira Woes\n\nIn Nigeria, the company had been under pressure for months as authorities focused on the role played by crypto in speculation against the naira, which has lost around 65% of its value against the dollar.\n\nPart of the currency's depreciation was deliberate as the government eased longstanding foreign exchange controls that had pegged it at an unsustainably strong level against the greenback. But the descent has been accompanied by sometimes wild volatility that's hurt confidence and put crypto under scrutiny.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced Tuesday it will ban person-to-person cryptocurrency trading in the naira.

The company, and the two managers, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, have denied the allegations.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria's crypto community is buzzing in the wake of Teng's allegation.\n\nSome who spoke to DL News said Binance should either \"name names\" or refrain from besmirching the government's position.\n\nThe bribery allegations are being secretly investigated by state officials, according to a person close to the matter.\n\n\"It's possible that someone who claimed to have reasonable access to people in power may have approached them [Binance],\" the person said.\n\nInvestigators are also looking into possible ties between the alleged bribe offer and the escape of Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance's regional executive in Africa, from custody in Abuja on March 22.\n\nAnjarwalla and another Binance executive, Tigran Gambaryan, visited Nigeria on February 26 to talk about the simmering conflict between the company and the government.\n\nThat meeting deadlocked when Nigerian officials demanded access to customer data of Binance's Nigerian users, which the pair declined to provide, an official close to the case told DL News.\n\nThey were then detained in a government \"guest house\" before being charged with money laundering and tax violation offences alongside Binance.\n\nAnjarwalla escaped custody before the court proceedings began while Gambaryan has spent almost 100 days in detention without a decision on his bail application, which his lawyer has called state-sanctioned hostage taking.\"\n\n\"Gambaryan is incarcerated in Kuje Prison with a trial date set for May 17.\n\nThe bribery development is inflaming an already tense situation for the world's biggest crypto exchange.\n\nTeng said the payment solicitation came after a private hearing between the company and some Nigerian lawmakers over regulatory issues in January.\n\nThis week, The New York Times reported that it was Gambaryan who fielded the alleged request from Nigerian officials during a trip to the nation in January. The newspaper also reported the figure of $150 million.\n\nTeng said in his post that Binance officials were approached by someone purporting to represent the legislative committee who demanded a bribe to settle the problem.\n\nThe accusation is the latest salvo in a standoff between Nigeria's government and the country's burgeoning crypto industry.\n\nThe conflict began earlier this year when Nigeria's government blamed crypto trading for the country's currency woes.\n\nSeveral state officials including the central bank, law enforcement, and Nigeria's economic team accused rich crypto trading merchants who process large volumes in peer-to-peer transactions of manipulating the exchange rate of the naira against foreign currencies.\n\nBinance, the largest P2P crypto trading marketplace for Nigerians at the time with an estimated 13 million customers, got caught in the middle of the storm that has since morphed into the current legal crisis.\n\nBinance exited the Nigerian market amid the tussle and P2P trading in the country shifted to other exchanges like OKX, KuCoin, and Bybit.\n\nSeveral platforms have delisted the naira as Nigeria's government banned P2P crypto trading in May.\n\nDespite these measures, the naira has continued to show weakness and its exchange rate against the US dollar has now fallen more than 40% in the last month -- the same level it was earlier this year when alarm bells began to ring.", "source": {"uri": "dlnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DL News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance",

Binance declined the offer and continued to seek a diplomatic resolution to the matter.\n\nFollowing the refusal, further meetings were arranged involving representatives from various Nigerian governmental bodies, including the National Security Adviser's office and the Central Bank of Nigeria, among others.\n\nDespite the complexity of the situation, Teng stated that Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, head of Binance Africa, were assured of their safety for these meetings.\n\nHowever, the situation worsened when Nigerian officials detained Gambaryan and Anjarwalla, confiscated their passports and phones, and demanded that Binance comply with specific requests, including delisting the Nigerian naira from their platform.\n\nIn response to the escalating demands and the continued detention of its employees, Binance has temporarily shut down certain services in Nigeria, hoping to secure their release and resolve the situation amicably.", "source": {"uri": "cryptodaily.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "cryptodaily.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Associations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Gambaryan, who serves as Binance's Head of Financial Crime Compliance, is being tried on money laundering charges along with the firm.\n\nBinance's and Gambaryan's money laundering trial started on 2 May while tax evasion charges will be tried on 17 May, falling on his 40th birthday.\n\nSince the arrests of Gambaryan and Anjarwalla, Binance has remained silent - publicly at least. The world's biggest crypto exchange commented on Anjarwalla's escape, stating, \"We were made aware that Nadeem is no longer in Nigerian custody. Our primary focus remains on the safety of our employees and we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to quickly resolve this issue,\" but was rather muted on Gambaryan's case.\n\nTeng has now broken this silence, writing a lengthy blog post titled \"Tigran Gambaryan is Innocent and Must Be Released\" on Tuesday, defending Gambaryan and decrying his arrest.\n\n\"I want to start by sharing a bit about Tigran, a person I've gotten to know well, and admire deeply, since I joined Binance,\" Teng wrote. \"The greatest irony and most unfortunate fact is that a highly valued global financial crime fighter, who is professionally recognized by his peers in both the private and public sectors, has been detained in Nigeria for more than two months for spurious reasons.\"\n\n\"Tigran did not go to Nigeria as a \"decision-maker,\" nor a \"negotiator.\" He was merely acting as a functional expert in financial crime and capacity building in policy discussions,\" Teng explained. \"The ordeal has been deeply distressing for Tigran, his family and friends, as well as the entire Binance community.\"\n\nTeng also alleged that the firm was approached by \"unknown persons who suggested to them to make a payment in settlement of the allegations\" and that there was a \"demand for a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away and that our decision was expected by the morning.\"\n\nIn a separate post on LinkedIn, Teng stated, \"We are tirelessly working to #BringTigranHome. Our request is for Tigran to be safely returned to his wife and children.\"\n\nNigeria has since rejected the \"secret\" payment allegations. \"Teng made false allegations of bribery against unidentified Nigerian government officials who he claimed demanded $150 million in cryptocurrency payments to resolve the ongoing criminal investigation against the company,\" the Ministry of Information spokesman Rabiu Ibrahim said.\n\n\"This claim by Binance CEO lacks any iota of substance. It is nothing but a diversionary tactic.\"\n\n\"The phantom bribe claim is part of an orchestrated international campaign by this company that is facing criminal prosecution in many countries including the US, to undermine the Nigerian government,\" Ibrahim added.\n\n\"It will not clear its name in Nigeria by resorting to fictional claims and mudslinging media campaigns.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerian authorities are planning to ban the use of the naira for P2P cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Director General Emomotimi Agama said on Monday that the new rules could come \"in the coming days.\"\n\n\"The thing that needs to be done is delisting the naira from the P2P space in order to avoid the level of manipulation that is currently happening,\" Agama said.\n\n\"Recent concerns regarding crypto P2P traders and their perceived impact on the exchange rate of the naira has underscored the need for collective action,\" he said.", "source": {"uri":

The New York Times reported this $150m \"settlement\" originated within the Nigerian government.\n\nThe conflict began on Feb. 26 when executives Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla traveled to Abuja to address the Binance-Nigerian government dispute.

We will work tirelessly with public and private partners to remove them.\n\n\"Furthermore, we will continue engagement with Nigeria's Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on resolving potential historic tax liabilities.\"\n\nTeng added that The Nigerian government has extraordinary power to determine the future of Binance and the broader crypto industry within its borders.\n\nHe explained that Binance wants to have a future where they will work alongside the Nigerian government to be part of building a strong economy for the Nigerian people.\n\nHe, however, stated the crisis must come to a resolution quickly, and Tigran must be allowed to go home if they are to move forward.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Inland_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Inland Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot_20240507-1253173-640x360.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-28", "textStart": 1080, "textEnd": 1087}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-22", "textStart": 1139, "textEnd": 1147}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

January 2024 where the company was warned of potential arrests if it did not cooperate.\n\nHe said Binance refused the alleged bribe demand and instead proposed conditions for settlement talks, including seeing full details of the allegations against the company.\n\nTHE WHISTLER reports that Binance's problem in Nigeria was one in a broader regulatory crackdown on the company and the cryptocurrency industry globally following economic downturns.\n\nThe world's largest crypto exchange faced scrutiny from watchdogs across the U.S., and Europe, among others, over allegations it has

The agreed next step was for the FIU to share a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) setting out proposed terms and conditions for the sharing of anti-money laundering (AML)-related information,\" he narrated.\n\n\"On January 8, Binance employees had a face-to-face meeting with three members of the HCFC and a clerk in Abuja at the House of Representatives building for a scheduled pre-hearing engagement in private. The meeting was chaired by the Honourable Peter Akpanke, the Honourable Philip Agbese, and the Honourable Peter Aniekwe, as well as a clerk.\n\n\"During the conversation, the Committee highlighted the important nature of the issues at hand and the lengths to which they were prepared to go to summon Binance, including issuing arrest warrants against our team and CEO and preventing our team from leaving the country. While concerning, it was understood that the HCFC does not in fact have the power to issue arrest warrants.\n\n\"The Committee confirmed that the public hearing would proceed on the 10th of January and that Binance would be afforded an opportunity to respond to any allegations publicly in the presence of the petitioners, press, and over 30 agencies.\n\n\"Despite multiple requests, Binance had still not received details of the allegations, and our employees, therefore, inquired if there was an opportunity to submit our responses in writing and in the absence of a public hearing. There were a number of reasons for that, including the sensitivity of the information and getting the opportunity to see the allegations in full and prepare a thorough substantive response. The meeting ended with the Chair confirming they would consider the matter and revert through Binance's local counsel.\n\n\"However, as our employees were leaving the venue, they were approached by unknown persons who suggested to them to make a payment in settlement of the allegations. Later that day, our local counsel -- representing us at that time -- was summoned by the Committee through someone purporting to be their agent, who relayed the Committee's terms and instructed our local counsel to advise us.\n\n\"Counsel reported back that he had been presented with a demand for a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away and that our decision was expected by the morning. Our team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed. We, of course, declined the payment demand via our counsel, not viewing it to be a legitimate settlement offer, and clarified that we would engage in settlement negotiations on the following conditions:\n\n* Binance needs to see the relevant petition and/or the details of all allegations.\n\n* Any settlement must be official, recorded in writing, and signed by all relevant parties.\n\n* Any settlement must encompass all relevant agencies and be in full and final settlement of all allegations, including any potential historic tax liabilities, if applicable, with guarantees.\n\n*While the exact terms of any settlement may have to remain private, there would have to be some public acknowledgment that a resolution has been reached.\n\n* There should be no public hearing before the Committee.\n\n*Our contractors and employees are not to be intimidated, harassed, or detained.\n\n'Tigran Gambaryan's detention unjust'\n\nMeanwhile Teng in the post, voiced his profound concern regarding what he said is \"the unjust detention of one of its mid-level employees (who has no decision-making powers) by the Nigerian government.\"\n\nHe complained that despite numerous efforts at constructive engagement and a willingness to meet the requests of Nigerian authorities, a completely innocent employee remains detained for spurious reasons.\n\n\"Over the past two and a half years, Binance has worked hard to restructure our organization and personnel and upgrade our systems. We have new leadership in place with deep compliance experience and impressive backgrounds ranging from top traditional financial institutions and leading tech companies, to law enforcement and major corporate entities,\" he wrote.\n\n\"We continue to do anything and everything we can to support Tigran. This support is unwavering. Tigran did not go to Nigeria as a \"decision-maker,\" nor a \"negotiator.\" He was merely acting as a functional expert in financial crime and capacity building in policy discussions.\"\n\nHe said Binance believes it's an easy solution to let Tigran go home to his family and then Binance will work through the same process that they have done with Nigeria's law enforcement community voluntarily more than 600 times in the past.\n\nTeng continued, \"We will work tirelessly with public and private partners to remove them. Furthermore, we will continue engagement with Nigeria's Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on resolving potential historic tax liabilities.\n\n\"It remains unclear to me as to why this is not a solution to which the Nigerian government officials are willing to agree,\" added Teng. \"The Nigerian government has extraordinary power to determine the future of Binance and the broader crypto industry within its borders. At the end of the day, Binance wants to have a future where we work alongside the Nigerian government to be part of building a strong economy for the Nigerian people. But this crisis must come to a resolution quickly, and Tigran must be allowed to go home if we're going to move forward.\"\n\nTo invite a company's mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them, has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide, he noted.\n\nAdditionally, on 25 April, during a bail hearing for Tigran, the EFCC's prosecutor said to the court, \"The 1st defendant (Binance) is operating virtually. The only thing we have to hold on to is this defendant (Tigran).\"\n\nAccording to him, \"the message from the Nigerian government is clear: we must detain an innocent, mid-level employee, a former U.S. federal agent and place him in a dangerous prison to control Binance. This regrettable turn of events contradicts the spirit of cooperation and transparency that Binance has consistently demonstrated in its interactions with the regulatory authorities.\"\n\nTeng further said, \"Binance remains committed to embracing the opportunity that lies with taking an innovative approach to using digital assets and platforms but we also must build a future where we are seen, as we see ourselves, as good actors in the international community.\n\n\"I'd like to express my deepest gratitude for the many notes of support we have received from around the world in response to this crisis and hope that my next update is one where our employees are safe at home with their families.\"", "source": {"uri": "hallmarknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hallmarknews"}, "authors":

\"make the issues go away\".\n\nFollowing the incident, the Binance CEO said their executives were then invited to meet with the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), a move Binance believed would help resolve the issues diplomatically.\n\nMeanwhile, Teng said the meeting was supposed to be a diplomatic effort to resolve issues, noting that the Nigerian government gave \"multiple assurances that they would be granted safe passage for their meetings.\"\n\nTeng said the meeting was scheduled for \"February 26, 2024, at 2 pm at ONSA's offices in Abuja.\"\n\nHe said after the meeting, the executives, Gambaryan and Anjarwalla, were told to wait outside shortly, only to be summoned back by the officials two hours later.\n\nAccording to him, this led to the arrest and detention of the two executives.\n\nOn February 28, Nairametrics reported that Nigeria officials detained two senior Binance executives.\n\nNadeem Anjarwalla, a 37-year-old British-Kenyan who serves as the regional manager for Africa, and Tigran Gambaryan, a 39-year-old American in charge of financial crime compliance at Binance.\n\nThe executives visited Nigeria in response to the country's recent crackdown on various cryptocurrency trading platforms.\n\nDuring their stay, they were apprehended by the ONSA and their passports were confiscated.\n\nIn response to the detention of its executives, Binance discontinued the trading of the naira against bitcoin and tether cryptocurrencies on its exchange.\n\nMeanwhile, on March 24, a statement from ONSA confirmed that one of the executives, Anjarwalla, subsequently escaped from lawful custody.\n\nThe Briton, who also has Kenyan citizenship, is believed to have flown out of Abuja using a Middle East airliner.\n\nIt remains unclear how Mr Anjarwalla got on an international flight despite his British passport, with which he entered Nigeria, remaining in the custody of the Nigerian authorities.\n\nHowever, the Federal Government said it is discussing with Interpol to secure an international arrest warrant for Anjarwalla and extradite him to Nigeria.\n\nThe Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) in Abuja has filed legal proceedings against the cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, alleging four instances of tax evasion.\n\nThe allegation against Binance involves the non-remittance of value added tax (VAT), company income tax (CIT), non-compliance with tax return filing obligations, and facilitating tax evasion for its users.\n\nFurthermore, in the lawsuit, the Federal Government charged Binance with not registering for tax purposes with the FIRS and violating the country's tax laws.\n\nAll parties involved have pleaded not guilty to all charges, as the case is adjourned till May 17 by the Federal High Court in Abuja.", "source": {"uri": "newsghana.com.gh", "dataType": "news", "title": "News Ghana"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org",

We will always work to protect innocent users, and bad actors are not welcome on our platform. We will work tirelessly with public and private partners to remove them. Furthermore, we will continue engagement with Nigeria's Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on resolving potential historic tax liabilities.\n\nIt remains unclear to me as to why this is not a solution to which the Nigerian government officials are willing to agree. The Nigerian government has extraordinary power to determine the future of Binance and the broader crypto industry within its borders.\n\nAt the end of the day, Binance wants to have a future where we work alongside the Nigerian government to be part of building a strong economy for the Nigerian people. But this crisis must come to a resolution quickly, and Tigran must be allowed to go home if we're going to move forward.\"\n\nIn March, Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) leveled various charges against Binance, Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla, the regional manager for the crypto exchange's Africa operations.\n\nThe charges included \"operating without the required license, unlawfully negotiating foreign exchange rates, tax evasion and concealing the origin of illegal proceeds and revenue of $35.4 million.\"\n\nDon't Miss a Beat - Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\nGenerated Image: Midjourney\n\nThe post Binance CEO Richard Teng Demands Nigeria Release Imprisoned Employee, Offers Help in Resolving Tax Issues appeared first on The Daily Hodl.", "source": {"uri": "cryptodaily.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "cryptodaily.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Inland_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Inland Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Financial_Crimes_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic and Financial Crimes Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 13}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Binance did not immediately comment, but in a statement on Tuesday accused Nigeria of setting a dangerous precedent after its executives were invited for talks and then detained as part of a crackdown on the crypto industry.\n\nTeng's blog is the latest in a dispute that has already seen Binance close in Nigeria. Nigeria blamed Binance for its currency problems after cryptocurrency websites emerged as platforms of choice for trading the Nigerian naira as the country grappled with chronic dollar shortages.\n\nBinance said in early March it was stopping all transactions and trading in naira.

cryptocurrencies on its exchange.\n\nMeanwhile, on March 24, a statement from ONSA confirmed that one of the executives, Anjarwalla, subsequently escaped from lawful custody.\n\nHowever, the Federal Government said it is discussing with Interpol to secure an international arrest warrant for Anjarwalla and extradite him to Nigeria.\n\nThe Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) in Abuja has filed legal proceedings against the cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, alleging four instances of tax evasion.\n\nThe allegation against Binance involves the non-remittance of value added tax (VAT), company income tax (CIT), non-compliance with tax return filing obligations, and facilitating tax evasion for its users.\n\nFurthermore, in the lawsuit, the Federal Government charged Binance with not registering for tax purposes with the FIRS and violating the country's tax laws.\n\nAccording to the FIRS, \"One of the counts in the lawsuit pertains to Binance's alleged failure to collect and remit various categories of taxes to the federation as stipulated by Section 40 of the FIRS Establishment Act 2007 as amended.\"\n\nAll parties involved have pleaded not guilty to all charges, as the case is adjourned till May 17 by the Federal High Court in Abuja.", "source": {"uri": "nairametrics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nairametrics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cyrus_ademola@nairametrics.com",

Nigeria sought bribes from our executives before detention  --  Binance CEO", "body": "Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency trading platform, Richard Teng, has claimed that some unknown persons sought a bribe of cryptocurrency from its executives, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, before their detention on February 28, 2024.\n\nTeng made the claim in a blog post on Monday, detailing how the Binance executives tried to engage with Nigerian authorities, including a January 8 meeting in Abuja, before they were accused of criminal acts.\n\nHe said the meeting was set up with the Nigeria government through a committee consisting of about \"30 agencies.\"\n\nHe noted that the committee emphasized the serious nature of the meeting and their readiness to issue arrest warrants and restrict travel for Binance's team.\n\nHowever, it was discovered that the committee lacks the actual authority to issue arrest warrants.\n\nThe meeting was later postponed to January 11, 2024, Teng said.\n\nThe CEO stated that on the same day, January 8, some unknown persons approached their employees seeking bribes in cryptocurrency to \"make the issues go away\".\n\nFollowing the incident, the Binance CEO said their executives were then invited to meet with the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), a move Binance believed would help resolve the issues diplomatically.\n\nMeanwhile, Teng said the meeting was supposed to be a diplomatic effort to resolve issues, noting that the Nigerian government gave \"multiple assurances that they would be granted safe passage for their meetings.\"\n\nTeng said the meeting was scheduled for \"February 26, 2024, at 2 pm at ONSA's offices in Abuja.\"\n\nHe said after the meeting, the executives, Gambaryan and Anjarwalla, were told to wait outside shortly, only to be summoned back by the officials two hours later.\n\nAccording to him, this led to the arrest and detention of the two executives.\n\nOn February 28, Nairametrics reported that Nigeria officials detained two senior Binance executives: Nadeem Anjarwalla, a 37-year-old British-Kenyan who serves as the regional manager for Africa, and Tigran Gambaryan, a 39-year-old American in charge of financial crime compliance at Binance.\n\nThe executives visited Nigeria in response to the country's recent crackdown on various cryptocurrency trading platforms.\n\nDuring their stay, they were apprehended by the ONSA and their passports were confiscated.\n\nIn response to the detention of its executives, Binance discontinued the trading of the naira against bitcoin and tether cryptocurrencies on its exchange.\n\nMeanwhile, on March 24, a statement from ONSA confirmed that one of the executives, Anjarwalla, subsequently escaped from lawful custody.\n\nThe Briton, who also has Kenyan citizenship, is believed to have flown out of Abuja using a Middle East airliner.\n\nIt remains unclear how Mr Anjarwalla got on an international flight despite his British passport, with which he entered Nigeria, remaining in the custody of the Nigerian authorities.\n\nHowever, the Federal Government said it is discussing with Interpol to secure an international arrest warrant for Anjarwalla and extradite him to Nigeria.\n\nThe Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) in Abuja has filed legal proceedings against the cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, alleging four instances of tax evasion.\n\nThe allegation against Binance involves the non-remittance of value added tax (VAT), company income tax (CIT), non-compliance with tax return filing obligations, and facilitating tax evasion for its users.\n\nFurthermore, in the lawsuit, the Federal Government charged Binance with not registering for tax purposes with the FIRS and violating the country's tax laws.\n\nAll parties involved have pleaded not guilty to all charges, as the case is adjourned till May 17 by the Federal High Court in Abuja.",

Before this move, Gambaryan and several Binance team members visited Nigeria in January 2024 to meet with the House Committee on Financial Crimes (HCFC).\n\nTeng stated that the Committee emphasised the gravity of the situation and threatened arrest warrants for Binance's team and CEO, while confirming a public hearing on January 10 without providing specific allegations to the company.\n\nThe team at Binance asked for written responses rather than a public hearing, citing information gaps and security issues. However, as they left the venue, they were approached by unidentified individuals who suggested they pay to settle the allegations.\n\nLater, someone claiming to represent the committee summoned Binance's local counsel and demanded a significant cryptocurrency payment within 48 hours. New York Times put the figure at $150 million. The exchange declined this demand and outlined settlement conditions, including seeing the allegations, official written agreements signed by all parties, and employee protection from intimidation or harassment.\n\nIn March, Nigeria's tax authority filed tax evasion charges against Binance, alleging that the exchange failed to register with the authorities for tax purposes.\n\nHowever, Teng has highlighted flaws in Nigeria's 2022 SEC regulations on digital assets, claiming they lacked clarity on key licencing requirements, making it nearly impossible for crypto exchanges to obtain permits and comply.\n\nMoreover, he said the authority didn't respond to Binance's request for practical guidance on the licencing process and offer. Consequently, \"We will continue engagement with Nigeria's Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on resolving potential historic tax liabilities.\"\n\nIn April, the employees and Binance were charged with money laundering of over $35 million. Gambaryan, now held in a correctional centre in Abuja, pleaded not guilty to the charges. However, his colleague escaped detention and fled from Nigeria, and he is reportedly being spotted in Kenya with talks to extradite him.\n\nMeanwhile, Gambaryan has applied for bail and is awaiting a ruling, scheduled for May 17, 2024. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) stated that Gambaryan is a flight risk because his colleague fled custody.\n\nCommenting on Gambaryan's person, Teng described the reasons for his detention in Nigeria as bogus.\n\nPreviously, Binance clarified that Gambaryan has no decision-making authority in the company and is \"a strict law enforcement professional who is not part of Binance management.\" Thus, the CEO reiterated that \"[Gambaryan] did not go to Nigeria as a decision-maker or negotiator. He was merely acting as a functional expert in financial crime and capacity building in policy discussions.\"\n\nWhat's more, citing Gambaryan's April bail hearing, Teng stated that the EFCC prosecutor argued that Binance operates virtually, making him the only thing to hold. This, according to him, shows Nigeria's intent to detain an innocent employee and place him in a \"dangerous prison\" to exert control over Binance.", "source": {"uri": "techpoint.africa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Techpoint Africa"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ifeoma_joy_okorie@techpoint.africa", "name": "Ifeoma Joy Okorie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intimidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal liability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Financial_Crimes_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic and Financial Crimes Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://techpoint.africa/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Richard-Teng.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-10", "textStart": 584, "textEnd": 594}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-05-", "textStart": 2386, "textEnd": 2392}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nRichard Teng, CEO of Binance, openly criticized Nigerian authorities for what he claims is an abuse of power and mistreatment of cryptocurrency exchange executives. He specifically mentioned Tigran Gambaryan, who is currently detained. Teng emphasized the importance of this situation for the business community following the arrests of Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, head of Binance Africa.\n\nThe conflict arises from the 2022 SEC regulations governing crypto exchanges in Nigeria. Despite Binance's proactive efforts to seek guidance, they have received no response. Moreover, Binance asserts that no Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) has been licensed under these regulations till date.\n\nIn early 2024, during discussions with Nigerian officials, Binance claims they were approached with a demand for a significant cryptocurrency payment to settle unspecified allegations. Nigeria denied these bribery allegations, dismissing them as tactics to divert attention from Binance's activities.\n\nAlso read: Tigran Detained!? Binance CEO Demands Release of Employee in Nigeria\n\nNigeria's Information Ministry spokesperson, Rabiu Ibrahim, rejected Binance CEO's bribery allegations as baseless and claimed they were part of an orchestrated effort to deflect attention. Ibrahim also characterized these allegations as part of Binance's strategy to divert attention from its activities. The Nigerian government firmly denied any involvement in bribery attempts. It accused Binance of making fictional claims and conducting media campaigns to improve its reputation amid ongoing criminal prosecutions in multiple countries.\n\nThe dispute unfolds amidst Nigeria's intensified scrutiny of cryptocurrencies, fueled partly by concerns over the depreciation of the local currency, the naira.\n\nThe currency's decline is partly attributed to adjustments in foreign exchange controls and increased volatility managed by the Nigerian authorities. The SEC has banned person-to-person crypto trading involving the naira to address these concerns. Additionally, they have hinted at forthcoming regulations to govern the sector.\n\nHowever, Binance has yet to respond to Nigeria's accusations and denials, leaving uncertainty about Tigran Gambaryan's future and the implications of Binance's operations in Nigeria.\n\nDespite the turmoil, BNB, Binance's native token, continues to experience positive trading at $600, with an 8.3% increase last week. This resilience reflects investor confidence in the ability of Binance to weather the regulatory challenges and legal uncertainties.", "source": {"uri": "coinpedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elena_r@coinpedia.org", "name": "Elena R", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technical analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_controls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange controls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "http://image.coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/30183605/Binances-New-Chapter-Balancing-Innovation-with-Regulation.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Both executives have found themselves trapped in a legal tussle in Nigeria, facing charges of tax evasion and money laundering - allegations vehemently disputed by the company.\n\n\"To invite a company's mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them, has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide,\" Teng said.\n\nTeng provided a detailed account of the events leading up to the executives' detention, shedding light on the company's efforts to engage constructively with Nigerian authorities. Meetings held as early as January 2024 aimed at fostering collaboration were abruptly disrupted when Nigerian officials demanded the delisting of the country's currency, the naira, from Binance's platform, alongside intrusive demands for user data.\n\nThe CEO expressed profound dismay over the protracted detention of Gambaryan, lamenting what he termed as \"dubious grounds\" for his continued confinement. Despite diplomatic overtures and assurances of cooperation, Nigerian authorities have yet to relent, leaving Binance in a state of limbo.\n\nHowever, the plot thickened with Teng's revelation in a recent blog post, wherein he disclosed attempts at bribery directed at Binance executives before their detention. The CEO recounted a brazen encounter following a meeting with Nigerian officials on January 8, during which unidentified individuals purportedly offered to absolve the company of allegations in exchange for a substantial sum in cryptocurrency - a proposition summarily rejected by Binance.\n\n\"As our employees were leaving the venue, they were approached by unknown persons who suggested to them to make a payment in settlement of the allegations.\n\n\"Later that day, our local counsel -- representing us at that time -- was summoned by the committee through someone purporting to be their agent, who relayed the committee's terms and instructed our local counsel to advise us.\n\n\"Counsel reported back that he had been presented with a demand for a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away and that our decision was expected by the morning.\n\n\"Our team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed. We, of course, declined the payment demand via our counsel, not viewing it to be a legitimate settlement offer,\" Teng said.\n\nBinance's ordeal is part of a broader crackdown on the crypto industry by the Nigerian government.\n\nHow we got here - the Backstory\n\nThe unfolding drama surrounding the detention of two senior Binance executives, Nadeem Anjarwalla and Tigran Gambaryan, by Nigerian officials, has thrust the global cryptocurrency community into a whirlwind of speculation and intrigue. What began as a routine visit to Nigeria in February, in response to the country's heightened scrutiny of cryptocurrency trading platforms escalated into a complex legal battle fraught with diplomatic tensions and allegations of impropriety.\n\nIn response to the detention, Binance took decisive action, discontinuing the trading of the Nigerian naira against popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and tether on its platform.\n\nHowever, the plot thickened with the revelation on March 24 that Anjarwalla had managed to escape from lawful custody, throwing Nigerian authorities into disarray. The British-Kenyan executive, reportedly utilizing a Middle East airliner, fled Abuja despite his British passport remaining in Nigerian custody. The audacious escape prompted swift condemnation from the Nigerian government, which vowed to pursue international avenues, including cooperation with Interpol, to secure Anjarwalla's extradition.\n\nAmidst the escalating tensions, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) in Abuja escalated the legal battle by filing proceedings against Binance, alleging four instances of tax evasion. The FIRS accused the cryptocurrency exchange of failing to remit Value Added Tax (VAT) and Company Income Tax (CIT), neglecting tax return filing obligations, and facilitating tax evasion among its users. The lawsuit also highlighted Binance's purported failure to register for tax purposes and its alleged violations of Nigerian tax laws.\n\nThe gravity of the situation became further apparent as the Federal High Court adjourned the case against Binance and its executives to May 17. The charges, ranging from money laundering to tax evasion, underscored the multifaceted legal challenges confronting Binance in Nigeria. Allegations of manipulation of the local currency by peer-to-peer traders on the platform only added to the complexity of the case.", "source": {"uri": "tekedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tekedia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samuel_nwite@tekedia.com", "name": "Samuel Nwite", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya_Colony", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya Colony"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Value-added tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inland Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_passport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British passport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_return_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax return (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peer-to-peer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://tkcdn.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/10204724/nigeria-binance.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-08", "textStart": 1934, "textEnd": 1943}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-24", "textStart": 3817, "textEnd": 3825}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 4940, "textEnd": 4946}], "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

He accused Nigeria of setting a dangerous precedent for detaining its executives after they were invited to the country for a meeting.\n\n\"To invite a company's mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them, has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide. Gambaryan was being held in Nigeria for more than two months for spurious reasons,\" Teng said.\n\nIn the statement, Teng asked the Nigerian government to release Gambaryan while Binance and Nigerian authorities resolve any issues.\n\n\"We will continue engagement with Nigeria's Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on resolving potential historic tax liabilities,\" he added.\n\nThe statement partly reads: \"As you may be aware, one of our beloved colleagues, Tigran Gambaryan, continues to be held by the government in Nigeria for more than 70 days. There has been much public commentary on this episode, and I wanted to take this opportunity to provide the facts so that the global community's perception may not be distorted unfairly. I also feel that it's time to speak out about this issue on behalf of the global business community. To invite a company's mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them, has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide.\n\n\"I want to start by sharing a bit about Tigran, a person I've gotten to know well and admire deeply since I joined Binance. The greatest irony and most unfortunate fact is that a highly valued global financial crime fighter, who is professionally recognised by his peers in both the private and public sectors, has been detained in Nigeria for more than two months for spurious reasons.\n\n\"Tigran has devoted his professional life to fighting financial crimes. Tigran's decade as a federal cop was documented in a book called, Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, and we put out this blog a few weeks ago to share more about his illustrious career fighting crime.\n\n\"He joined Binance after his time working for the U.S. IRS as a Special Agent to continue the work he started. He recognised that he could do even more good working for the largest company in this nascent industry to keep out bad actors and uphold market integrity. Anyone who has left public service for a private organisation can tell you that sometimes you can make an even greater positive impact working for a private company that has an extraordinary scale.\n\n\"Given this background, Tigran was hired in 2021 to help Binance develop and build stronger compliance controls, specific to law enforcement cooperation and stopping financial crime. As the head of Binance's Financial Crime Compliance (FCC) team, he has been a strong advocate for Binance to develop policies and build compliance capabilities that set new industry standards. In 2022 and 2023, Tigran's Financial Crime Compliance team assisted global law enforcement in freezing and seizing more than $2.2B worth of assets, including more than $285M in cooperation with United States agencies like the FBI, DOJ, DEA, and others.\n\n\"Finally, it is important to note that Tigran did not go to Nigeria as a \"decision-maker,\" nor a \"negotiator.\" He was merely acting as a functional expert in financial crime and capacity building in policy discussions.\n\n\"On February 26, Tigran and Nadeem travelled to Nigeria and were present for the meetings they had scheduled and, as stated above, received multiple assurances for their safety. In their first meeting, they met with leaders from ONSA, the office of the President, the Central Bank, NFIU, EFCC, and the SEC.\n\n\"The tone of the meeting was neutral -- neither friendly nor hostile -- and it seemed that overall progress was being made during the two hours or so that the meeting lasted.\n\n\"One of the EFCC leaders, with whom Tigran had built a relationship over the last several months, took them aside and told them that everything was progressing well and that Tigran and Nadeem had no need to worry. The Binance employees were told that a further meeting would take place shortly after, this time involving the most senior leaders from ONSA, CBN, SEC, and the Ministry of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy.\n\n\"After waiting more than two hours, the Binance employees were invited back into a meeting room albeit with different attendees than the ones announced -- specifically, there were four members of the EFCC.\n\n\"The leader of the group took on a hostile approach. He said that the issues involving Binance were of national security and made the following demands: Delist naira from the Binance platform (this was the first time this request was explicitly made by Nigerian authorities to Binance), Provide granular-level detail on all Nigerian users, Provide financial/tax compliance information.\n\n\"They further explained that, until such time as Binance would fulfil these requests, Tigran and Nadeem would be their \"guests\" and be moved for \"security reasons\" to a house in a high-security compound. Additionally, they requested that Tigran and Nadeem hand over their passports.\n\n\"Following the meeting, Tigran and Nadeem were escorted to their hotel, asked to pack their belongings, and moved to the secure compound, which was controlled by ONSA. Their mobile phones were confiscated, and it was made clear to them that they were not free to leave. Both Nadeem and Tigran had no control over when and with whom they spoke.\n\n\"From this point on, Tigran (a US citizen) and Nadeem (a British-Kenyan citizen) were under detention. Both the UK High Commission and the US Embassy were alerted in the overnight hours of the detention of Tigran and Nadeem.\n\n\"The next day, Binance's legal counsel sent an email to the leaders of ONSA, asking them to \"urgently clarify the legal basis for the detention of [its] employees\" and noting that their respective nation's embassies (U.S. for Tigran and UK for Nadeem) had been notified. Our note further stated: \"We understand from our employees, after conversations with you yesterday, your main concern is the listing of the naira as a tradable asset on the Binance platform. This is the first time we have been made aware of this concern in relation to the listing of the naira on our platform. We are able to delist the naira from the Binance platform. However, we ask that you guarantee the immediate release of Tigran and Nadeem and that no restrictions will be placed on their movements, including their departure from Nigeria.\"\n\n\"The same day, ONSA responded by email, stating that Tigran and Nadeem were their \"guests\" and treated with \"hospitality.\"\n\n\"We also received confirmation that day that the U.S. and UK governments had been briefed on the situation and were following up closely.\n\n\"The next 24 hours were marked by aggressive behaviour towards Tigran and Nadeem where they were accused personally of holding responsibility for the state of the naira and the overall economy, and allegations of terrorist financing and money laundering.\n\n\"On February 28, we removed the naira pairing from our site and shut down the P2P product for Nigeria on the Binance platform. We advised ONSA of our actions in an email and requested that Tigran and Nadeem be immediately provided with \"safe passage to the airport.\n\n\"No official response from ONSA was received that day.\n\n\"On this day, the same EFCC leader with whom Tigran had become close over the past few months broke down emotionally to Tigran. He apologised and said it was his wrongdoing as he had given Tigran and Nadeem his word that everything would be OK and that the meeting was supposed to be a friendly one.\n\n\"Soon thereafter news of Tigran and Nadeem's detention broke in global media. Nearly a month later, on March 23, we learned that Nadeem left unlawful detention. From that point on, things went from bad to worse for Tigran.\n\n\"On April 25, during a bail hearing for Tigran Gambaryan, the EFCC's prosecutor said to the court, \"The 1st defendant [Binance] is operating virtually. The only thing we have to hold on to is this defendant [Tigran].\"\n\n\"The message from the Nigerian government is clear: we must detain an innocent, mid-level employee and a former U.S. federal agent, and place him in a dangerous prison in order to control Binance.\n\n\"Since I assumed the role of CEO of Binance, I have made it a key commitment to work with global regulators and enforcement agencies to uphold the integrity of the global financial system.\n\n\"Over the past two and a half years, Binance has worked hard to restructure our organisation and personnel and upgrade our systems. We have new leadership in place with deep compliance experience and impressive backgrounds ranging from top traditional financial institutions and leading tech companies, to law enforcement and major corporate entities.\n\n\"Today, the Binance leadership team, including myself, report to a Board of Directors. The Board is responsible, as corporate steward, to safeguard the company's interests as well as make key decisions to ensure the long-term sustainability and viability of the business. It is through this process that we have become a stronger, safer, and even more compliant and secure platform for our users. We have evolved dramatically as a business.\n\n\"This ordeal has been deeply distressing for Tigran, his family and friends, as well as the entire Binance community. As mentioned above, to remove any doubt about suggestions that we had played a role in the country's currency crisis and as a good faith gesture, I made the difficult decision earlier this month to turn off our P2P product on the Binance platform for Nigeria and end the trading of all naira pairs on the spot exchange product on the Binance platform. Our hope when we took this drastic step was that our colleagues would be released and Binance could continue to work with the Nigerian government to resolve any further concerns. Unfortunately, that didn't happen.\n\n\"We continue to do anything and everything we can to support Tigran. This support is unwavering.\n\n\"Let Tigran go home to his family, and then Binance will work through the same process that we have done with Nigeria's law enforcement community voluntarily more than 600 times in the past. We will always work to protect innocent users, and bad actors are not welcome on our platform. We will work tirelessly with public and private partners to remove them. Furthermore, we will continue engagement with Nigeria's Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on resolving potential historic tax liabilities.\n\n\"It remains unclear to me as to why this is not a solution to which the Nigerian government officials are willing to agree. The Nigerian government has extraordinary power to determine the future of Binance and the broader crypto industry within its borders. At the end of the day, Binance wants to have a future where we work alongside the Nigerian government to be part of building a strong economy for the Nigerian people. But this crisis must come to a resolution quickly, and Tigran must be allowed to go home if we're going to move forward.\n\n\"Binance remains committed to embracing the opportunity that lies with taking an innovative approach to using digital assets and platforms but we also must build a future where we are seen, as we see ourselves, as good actors in the international community.\n\n\"I'd like to express my deepest gratitude for the many notes of support we have received from around the world in response to this crisis, and I hope that my next update is one where our employees are safe at home with their families.\"", "source": {"uri": "thewillnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THEWILL NEWS MEDIA - Nigeria News, Nigeria Politics, Breaking News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He said it was nothing but a diversionary tactic and an attempted act of blackmail by a company desperate to obfuscate the grievous criminal charges it is facing in Nigeria.\n\nIdris reiterated that the facts of the matter remains that Binance is being investigated in Nigeria for allowing its platform to be used for money laundering, terrorism financing, and foreign exchange manipulation through illegal trading.\n\nHe further said while a lawful investigation was going on, an executive of Binance, who was in court-sanctioned protective custody, escaped from Nigeria, and he is now a fugitive from the law.\n\nHe, however, said that working with the security agencies in Nigeria, INTERPOL is currently executing an international arrest warrant on the said fugitive.\n\nHe noted that the phantom bribe claim was part of an orchestrated international campaign by this company that is facing criminal prosecution in many countries, including the United States, to undermine the Nigerian government.\n\nHe emphasised that just a week ago, the founder and former CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, was sentenced to prison in the United States, after pleading guilty to charges very similar to what Binance is being investigated for in Nigeria.\n\nThe Minister said in addition, Zhao agreed to pay a fine of $50 million, while Binance is liable for $4.3 billion in fines and forfeitures to the US Government.\n\n\"We would like to remind Binance that it will not clear its name in Nigeria by resorting to fictional claims and mudslinging media campaigns.

In its short history, it has endured all manner of online heists, rug pulls, multi-billion dollar meltdowns, and lost its leading lights -- Sam Bankman-Fried, Changpeng Zhao -- to felony crime convictions and prison sentences.\n\nBut no episode hits the jaw-on-the-floor levels of the narrative unfolding in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation.\n\nFor the last 10 weeks, Nigerian anti-corruption officials have slammed Binance, the world's top crypto exchange and one of the industry's most influential companies, with enforcement actions.\n\nThey have accused the company of facilitating $35 million in money laundering transactions for criminals and aiding market manipulators who are destroying the value of the nation's fiat currency, the naira. They have also accused the company of tax evasion.\n\nThe authorities have expanded their investigation to encompass all the peer-to-peer crypto exchanges operating in the nation. For all intents and purposes, Nigeria has declared a legal war on cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, or EFCC, has also charged two Binance executives with the same allegations as their employer: Tigram Gambaryan, Binance's head of financial crimes compliance and a former special agent with the US Internal Revenue Service, and Nadeem Anjarwalla, a UK lawyer and Binance's regional head based in Kenya.\n\nGambaryan, who is imprisoned, will stand trial beginning May 17, even though he has yet to hear from a judge on whether he can post bail.\n\nAnjarwalla managed to elude his guards on March 22 and escape Nigeria.\n\nBinance and the two men have denied the allegations, and Gambaryan's lawyer has said his client is a \"state-sanctioned hostage\" of Nigeria's legal crackdown on the company.\n\nHow did the crisis get to this stage? Why is Gambaryan still incarcerated? And why were he and Anjarwalla detained in the first place?\n\nThey are essentially middle managers and not the senior executives who make strategic decisions, Binance told DL News. So why are they being held to answer for Binance's alleged infractions?\n\nNigerian officials have consistently declined to comment on the case to DL News.\n\nThe story begins not in Abuja, Nigeria's capital, but rather in Washington.\n\nOn November 21, Binance pleaded guilty to violating US banking laws by allowing criminals and terror groups to use its exchange to facilitate illegal transactions and paid a $4.3 billion penalty.\n\nCo-founder and then CEO Changpeng Zhao, who also pleaded guilty, resigned. (On April 30, a judge sentenced Zhao to a four month prison term.)\n\nThe case exposed the fundamental weaknesses of Binance's internal controls, and its very model as a free-floating \"decentralised\" entity that had no need for a global headquarters or many of the other norms and rules that govern global finance.\n\nHis successor, Richard Teng, wasted no time in pledging the company would focus on regulatory compliance. But given how rapidly the exchange expanded around the world with little regard for licencing and registration, that was going to a tall order.\n\nAnd Teng had far less time than he may have imagined.\n\nBy the time he took charge, the Philippines was running out of patience with the crypto exchange's penchant for operating in markets without a licence. Despite repeated warnings from regulators that they would take action, Binance did not get licenced there.\n\nIn March, Manila made good on its threat and blocked Binance. Soon enough, Apple and Google were working with officials to boot Binance's app from the app stores.\n\nMeanwhile, trouble was brewing on the other side of the world. Just as it did in the Philippines, Binance chose not to register in Nigeria and to operate by proxy through a a legion of agents and marketers.\n\nThis backfired severely when the naira, Nigeria's fiat currency, plunged in value compared with the dollar.\n\nBecause Binance offered a digital form of the naira, as well as USDT and other widely used stablecoins, it drew the ire of officials who suspected the platform was was enabling market manipulation.\n\nIt didn't take long for them point the finger at crypto trading platforms, especially Binance.\n\nSomewhere along the way, the government and the company agreed there should be in-person meetings, so the company dispatched Gambaryan and Anjarwalla to Abuja at the end of February.\n\nNo sooner had they arrived for talks than Nigerian officials demanded the two men produce data on Binance's millions of customers in the nation, according to officials familiar with the probe.\n\n'These charges against Tigran are meritless. It's outrageous that he would be remanded in a prison.'\n\n-- Binance spokesperson\n\nWhen the two executives balked, they were detained in a government \"guest house\" and forced to surrender their passports and mobile phones. Meanwhile, the government formed an inter-agency investigative committee led by the EFCC in collaboration with Nuhu Ribadu, the national security adviser.\n\nThe authorities kept the pressure on -- they wanted user data. Binance declined to provide it.\n\nThe country's parliament demanded that Teng appear before a legislative committee. Teng did not respond, at least not publicly.\n\nBinance then delisted the naira as one of the supported fiat currencies on its platform and closed all of its services for users in the country. It didn't matter.\n\nLater in March, Nigerian officials obtained a court order directing Binance to hand over customer details of its users to the EFCC.\n\nOn March 22, everything changed. Officials granted Anjarwalla permission to attend prayer services at a mosque in Abuja in observance of Ramadan. Somehow he managed to elude his guards during or after the service and make his way undetected to the airport.\n\nAnjarwalla had kept a second passport, from Kenya, hidden from the authorities. And with it in hand, he boarded a flight and escaped Nigerian airspace before officials could catch up.\n\nSenior officials in the EFCC and state security were embarrassed and furious, people familiar with the matter told DL News. They interrogated the guards about letting their charge slip through their fingers.\n\nUnfortunately for Gambaryan, he did not have an alternative means for escaping Nigeria. While he tried in vain to get a new US passport, sources told DL News, the EEFC turned the screws.\n\nOn March 29, the EEFC charged Binance and the two executives with laundering $35.4 million in illicit assets on the platform. In conjunction with the case, a court ordered Gambaryan to be incarcerated in Kuje Prison, a facility in Abuja that also houses terrorists.\n\nBinance, which had said virtually nothing publicly since the crisis unfolded, broke its silence.\n\n\"We are deeply disappointed that Tigran Gambaryan, who has no decision-making power in the company, continues to be detained,\" a company spokesperson told DL News on April 8.\n\n\"Tigran has been dedicated to public service and fighting crime for most of his life. These charges against him are meritless. It's outrageous that he would be remanded in a prison such as Kuje Correctional Facility.\"\n\nGambaryan's situation worsened as the court scheduled his trial to begin in early May, even though he had yet to have a hearing on whether he could secure bail.\n\nNumerous delays due to procedural mistakes by prosecutors delayed his bail hearing until late April, when his lawyer, Mark Mordi, pleaded with the court to release his client on bond.\n\nThe court, however, took the matter under advisement until May 17, the date his trial is set to begin. Mordi was outraged by the unorthodox decision.\n\n\"This is purely state-sanctioned hostage-taking,\" Mordi told the court in proceedings monitored by DL News.\n\nNigerian officials had not forgotten about Anjarwalla.\n\nOn April 30, Garba Baba Umar, a Nigerian member of Interpol's executive committee, told a Nigerian news outlet that the agency had traced Anjarwalla to Kenya, though he acknowledged the executive may have moved to another location.\n\nInterpol issued a Red Notice for Anjarwalla, which means Interpol's 196 member states are obliged to pick him up if he surfaces.\n\n\"Wherever he is, he will be smoked out,\" Umar said.\n\nNow the focus shifts back to Gambaryan as his trial date approaches on May 17. As it happens, that will be his 40th birthday.\n\nHis wife Yuki decried the Nigerian government for its treatment of her husband in a blog post on change.com on April 23.\n\n\"I am in a constant state of grief and anxiety, not knowing what other injustice he is going to be put through,\" she wrote.\n\n\"It is outrageous that Tigran, an innocent man, continues to be kept in a prison cell and the ruling on his bail will not be made until after the trial starts. This is just pure cruelty.\"", "source": {"uri": "dlnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DL News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org",

amounts of payments in digital currency to make their problems \" go away\".\n\nTeng made this known in a blog post on Tuesday, adding that Binance legal representative declined the offer from those undisclosed officials.\n\nRecall that 0n February 28, the Office of the National Special Adviser (ONSA) detained two top executives of Binance as part of an investigation bordering on illegal operations in the country and foreign exchange rate manipulations.\n\nThe detained executives included, a 37-year-old British-Kenyan, Nadeem Anjarwalla who is Binance's regional manager for Africa; and a 39-year-old US citizen, Tigran Gambaryan, Binance's head of financial crime compliance.\n\nOn March 25, the Federal Government filed a criminal charge against Binance for \"tax evasion\" -- the same period Anjarwalla fled detention.\n\nSpeaking on Binance's issues with the Nigerian government, Teng explained how the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange made an attempt to engage with the authorities, including a meeting on January 8 in Abuja, where it was confronted with criminal allegations.\n\nThe Binance CEO said that despite requests, the crypto firm has still not received details of the allegations, saying, \"And our employees, therefore, inquired if there was an opportunity to submit our responses in writing and in the absence of a public hearing\".\n\n\"There were a number of reasons for that, including the sensitivity of the information and getting the opportunity to see the allegations in full and prepare a thorough substantive response,\" he said.\n\n\"The meeting ended with the Chair confirming they would consider the matter and revert through Binance's local counsel.\n\n\"However, as our employees were leaving the venue, they were approached by unknown persons who suggested to them to make a payment in settlement of the allegations.\n\n\"Later that day, our local counsel -- representing us at that time -- was summoned by the Committee through someone purporting to be their agent, who relayed the Committee's terms and instructed our local counsel to advise us.\n\n\"Counsel reported back that he had been presented with a demand for a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away and that our decision was expected by the morning.\n\n\"Our team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed.\"\n\nTeng said the payment request was declined \"via our counsel, not viewing it to be a legitimate settlement offer\".\n\nThe CEO said Binance clarified that it would engage in settlement negotiations on the conditions that the relevant petition or the details of all allegations were seen, adding that any settlement \"must be official, recorded in writing, and signed by all relevant parties\".", "source": {"uri": "vanguardngr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanguard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Nigerian government firmly denies involvement in any bribery attempts.\n\nAccording to Teng's blog post, Binance attended a meeting with Nigerian officials in January, during which criminal allegations were raised against the company.\n\nTeng claimed that as Binance staff left the meeting, they were approached by unknown individuals who demanded a significant cryptocurrency payment within 48 hours to settle the allegations.\n\nThe blog post also mentioned that Gambaryan and his colleague returned to Nigeria in February at the authorities' invitation but were subsequently arrested.\n\nWhile one employee has managed to escape in recent months, Tigran Gambaryan remains in custody. He faces charges of tax evasion, currency speculation, and money laundering. His trial is scheduled to commence later this month.\n\nThe Nigerian government dismisses Binance's bribery claims as part of the company's \"orchestrated international campaign\" to undermine Nigeria's reputation.\n\nThe government also accuses Binance of resorting to fictional claims and mudslinging media campaigns to clear its name amidst criminal prosecutions in multiple countries, including the United States.\n\nIt is worth noting that Nigeria has been scrutinizing the role of cryptocurrencies in the depreciation of the local currency, the naira. The government attributes part of the currency's decline to foreign exchange control adjustments and increased volatility.\n\nTo address concerns, the Securities and Exchange Commission banned person-to-person cryptocurrency trading in the naira and indicated that new regulations would be implemented to govern the sector.\n\nIn addition to the issues in Nigeria, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao was recently sentenced to four months in prison in the US for failures that allowed cybercriminals and terrorist groups to trade freely on the platform.

Additionally, authorities have accused the crypto exchange Binance of enabling trades worth billions, further exacerbating the strain on the Naira.\n\nThe Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission also recently announced plans to remove the Naira from peer-to-peer trading platforms as part of a broader crackdown on crypto trading, which has been blamed for adding volatility to the foreign exchange market.", "source": {"uri": "cryptoslate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoSlate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "assad_jafri@cryptoslate.com", "name": "Assad Jafri", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blackmail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_financing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism financing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fugitive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peer-to-peer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/binance-nigeria-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 357, "textEnd": 362}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-26", "textStart": 1582, "textEnd": 1589}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

It's nothing but a diversionary tactic and an attempted act of blackmail by a company desperate to obfus\u00adcate the grievous criminal charges it is facing in Nigeria.\n\n\"The facts of this matter remain that Binance is being investigated in Nigeria for allowing its platform to be used for money laundering, terrorism financing, and foreign exchange manipulation through illegal trading.\n\n\"While this lawful investiga\u00adtion was going on, an executive of Binance, who was in court-sanc\u00adtioned protective custody, escaped from Nigeria, and he is now a fu\u00adgitive from the law. Working with the security agencies in Nigeria, Interpol is currently executing an international arrest warrant on the said fugitive.\n\n\"The phantom bribe claim is part of an orchestrated interna\u00adtional campaign by this company that is facing criminal prosecution in many countries including the United States, to undermine the Nigerian government.\n\n\"Just a week ago, the found\u00ader and former CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, was sentenced to prison in the United States, after pleading guilty to charges very sim\u00adilar to what Binance is being inves\u00adtigated for in Nigeria. In addition, Zhao agreed to pay a fine of $50 million, while Binance is liable for $4.3 billion in fines and forfeitures to the US Government.\"\n\n\"We would like to remind Bi\u00adnance that it'll not clear its name in Nigeria by resorting to fictional claims and mudslinging media campaigns. The only way to resolve its issues will be by submitting it\u00adself to unobstructed investigation and judicial due process.\n\n\"The government of Nigeria will continue to act within its laws and international norms and won't succumb to any form of blackmail from any entity, local or foreign,\" the statement added.\n\nReps To Probe Binance Chief Escape From NSA Custody\n\nMeanwhile, the House of Repre\u00adsentatives on Wednesday resolved to investigate the circumstances leading to the escape of one of the two Binance chiefs from the custody of the National Security Adviser and the allegations of bribery leveled against the House by persons believed to be officials of Binance.\n\nNadeem Anjarwalla, one of the two Binance chiefs, detained for offences bordering on mon\u00adey laundering escaped from the custody of the NSA on March 22, 2024.\n\nRecall that on three occasions, the House Committee on An\u00adti-Corruption had invited Binance officials to an investigative hearing in relation to a petition by some ac\u00adclaimed Niger Delta youths.\n\nAt each of the three meetings, a legal representative of the com\u00adpany appeared on their behalf, but was turned back on the excuse that only an executive of the company can address the committee in line with the rules of the House.\n\nThe Binance executive has been arrested by the police in Kenya and is expected to be extradited to Nige\u00adria by Interpol to face prosecution.\n\nAdopting a motion by Hon. Dominic Okafor (APGA, Anam\u00adbra), the House asked its relevant committees to conduct investiga\u00adtion on how the detainee was able to escape and fish out those culpa\u00adble in the escape.\n\nThe House wants those found guilty in aiding the escape of the detainee to be brought to justice.\n\nAccording to Okafor, the Ni\u00adgerian government arrested and detained Nadeem Anjarwalla, an executive of a crypto currency exchange company, Binance, on February 26, 2024 for alleged com\u00adplicity of the company in money laundering and terrorism financ\u00ading.\n\nAccording to him, the two Bi\u00adnance executives were billed to ap\u00adpear in court on April 4, 2024, to an\u00adswer to the alleged crimes against Nigeria before the security breach occurred which led to the escape of one of the company's executives in a very scandalous dimension.\n\nHe alleged that persons suspect\u00aded to have committed such atro\u00adcious crimes against the state of Ni\u00adgeria with already over-burdened security challenges were kept in a guest house in Abuja instead of lawful custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) or any other approved custodial facility.\n\nThe lawmaker said the escape of the Binance executive from the office of the National Security Ad\u00adviser using a \"smuggled passport\" is, to say the least, most disappoint\u00ading, embarrassing and disturbing as it portrays the porosity of the se\u00adcurity architecture of the country to the world.\n\nHe stressed that weeks after the unfortunate escape and inability of the security forces to re-arrest Nadeem Anjarwalla, the Kenyan police arrested him April 22, 2024 as the International Criminal Police Organisation.\n\nSimilarly, a member of the House, Nkama Nkemkama (LP, Ebonyi) alleged that an official of a company he did not name accused the House of demanding bribe from them.\n\nHe said the House has never had any dealings with the indi\u00advidual whose name he also did not mention, suggesting that the House conducts an investigation to determine the truth behind the allegation.\n\n\"We have never invited this per\u00adson before. This House has never had a meeting with this person be\u00adfore. And this person woke up one morning and decided to accuse this House of demanding a bribe from them. This House can never allow itself to be embarrassed or talked down on in any way,\" he said.\n\nIn his ruling, Speaker Abbas Tajudeen also maintained that the committee never had an interface with Binance.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Independent Newspapers Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type":

The pair had traveled to the country to liaise with officials as they conducted an investigation into crypto exchanges.\n\nBoth Binance execs were initially held without charge under the terms of a court order, before Anjarwalla escaped what Teng characterized as \"unlawful detention\". The pair, along with the exchange, were subsequently charged with tax evasion by Nigeria's Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), while Gambaryan was transferred to a jail run by the country's anti-corruption agency.\n\nAccording to local media, Nigeria is seeking the extradition of Anjarwalla; a spokesperson for his wife subsequently claimed that reports of his arrest in Kenya are false.\n\nIn his blog post, Teng emphasized that Gambaryan was visiting Nigeria as a \"functional expert in financial crime and capacity building in policy discussions,\" and did not go to the country as a \"'decision-maker,' nor a \"negotiator.'\"\n\nThe Binance CEO also published a detailed breakdown of the exchange's activities in Nigeria over the past two years, and its negotiations with Nigerian lawmakers and regulators.\n\nNigeria is currently undergoing a currency crisis, which Teng claims had been attributed by local authorities to Binance's activities in the country.\n\nAs well as pushing back against those claims, he alleged that Gambaryan, an \"innocent, mid-level employee,\" is being held in \"a dangerous prison in order to control Binance.\" Gambaryan has sued the Nigerian government for violating his fundamental human rights.\n\nTeng claimed that Gambaryan and Anjarwalla had \"received multiple assurances that they would be granted safe passage for their meetings,\" and that in the course of a \"hostile\" meeting, members of Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) demanded that the exchange delist the Nigerian naira from its platform and \"provide granular-level detail on all Nigerian users.\"\n\nFollowing their detention, Teng said, Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were subject to \"aggressive behavior\" and were personally accused of \"holding responsibility for the state of the naira and the overall economy,\" as well as allegations of terrorist financing and money laundering.\n\nDecrypt has reached out to the EFCC for comment and will update this article should they respond.\n\nAs a \"good faith gesture,\" Teng stated that Binance had delisted the naira and disabled its P2P product for Nigerian users, and urged the country's authorities to release Gambaryan and continue its \"engagement\" with the exchange over tax liabilities and cooperation with law enforcement.\n\n\"I hope that my next update is one where our employees are safe at home with their families,\" Teng added.", "source": {"uri": "decrypt.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Decrypt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_graves@decrypt.co", "name":

The Nigerian government firmly denies involvement in any bribery attempts.\n\nAccording to Teng's blog post, Binance attended a meeting with Nigerian officials in January, during which criminal allegations were raised against the company.\n\nTeng claimed that as Binance staff left the meeting, they were approached by unknown individuals who demanded a significant cryptocurrency payment within 48 hours to settle the allegations.\n\nThe blog post also mentioned that Gambaryan and his colleague returned to Nigeria in February at the authorities' invitation but were subsequently arrested.\n\nWhile one employee has managed to escape in recent months, Tigran Gambaryan remains in custody. He faces charges of tax evasion, currency speculation, and money laundering. His trial is scheduled to commence later this month.\n\nNigeria Intensifies Scrutiny Of Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe Nigerian government dismisses Binance's bribery claims as part of the company's \"orchestrated international campaign\" to undermine Nigeria's reputation.\n\nThe government also accuses Binance of resorting to fictional claims and mudslinging media campaigns to clear its name amidst criminal prosecutions in multiple countries, including the United States.\n\nIt is worth noting that Nigeria has been scrutinizing the role of cryptocurrencies in the depreciation of the local currency, the naira. The government attributes part of the currency's decline to foreign exchange control adjustments and increased volatility.\n\nTo address concerns, the Securities and Exchange Commission banned person-to-person cryptocurrency trading in the naira and indicated that new regulations would be implemented to govern the sector.\n\nIn addition to the issues in Nigeria, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao was recently sentenced to four months in prison in the US for failures that allowed cybercriminals and terrorist groups to trade freely on the platform. The exchange also agreed to pay $4.3 billion to resolve allegations raised by US authorities.\n\nBinance has not yet responded to the Nigerian government's accusations and denials. It remains to be seen how the exchange will address the situation or provide any further clarification regarding the allegations.\n\nAs of this writing, the exchange's native token, BNB, is trading at $585, up 4.4% in the past week.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com", "source": {"uri": "cryptodaily.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "cryptodaily.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speculation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changpeng_Zhao", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Changpeng Zhao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_controls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange controls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Exchanges", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Barter", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The blog did not say if the individuals were from the Nigerian authorities.\n\nLater that day, Binance's local lawyer was \"presented with a demand for a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away,\" Teng wrote. The amount in question was $150 million, the New York Times reported separately, citing people it didn't identify.\n\nNigeria, which blames crypto speculators for some of the naira's steep recent losses against the US dollar, disputed this account.\n\n\"Investigators are confident that the sequence of events is not as Binance has indicated, nor the material facts,\" said Zakari Mijinyawa, spokesman for Nigeria's National Security Adviser. \"It will of course be for the courts to decide, and for due process to be followed and justice delivered.\"\n\nThe incident marks the latest legal problems for Binance, whose founder Changpeng Zhao was ordered on May 1 to spend four months in prison in the US for failures that allowed cybercriminals and terrorist groups to freely trade on its platform. Binance in November agreed to pay $4.3 billion to resolve the US allegations.\n\nIn Nigeria, the confrontation led to the arrest of two of its staff after they returned in late February for further talks. One of them fled, but the other, Tigran Gambaryan, has been jailed at the Kuje correctional center in Abuja and will go on trial this month to face charges of tax evasion, currency speculation and money laundering.\n\nTeng said Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla, who later escaped from custody, were given repeated assurances they would be granted safe passage.\n\n\"To invite a company's mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them, has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speculation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changpeng_Zhao", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Changpeng Zhao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2069752!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/tigran-gambaryan-at-court-in-abuja-nigeria-on-april-4-photographer-david-exodus-bloomberg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-08", "textStart": 404, "textEnd": 410}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 1579, "textEnd": 1584}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

currency to make their problems in the country \"go away\".\n\nRichard Teng, the firm's chief executive officer (CEO), made the claim in a blog post shared with TheCable on Tuesday.\n\nOn February 28, the federal government detained two top executives of Binance as part of a probe bordering on illegal operations in the country and foreign exchange rate manipulations.\n\nThe detained executives included Nadeem Anjarwalla, a 37-year-old British-Kenyan and Binance's regional manager for Africa; and Tigran Gambaryan, a 39-year-old US citizen and Binance's head of financial crime compliance.\n\nNigeria's government, on March 25, filed a criminal charge against Binance for \"tax evasion\" -- the same period Anjarwalla fled detention.\n\nSpeaking on Binance's issues with the Nigerian government, Teng detailed how the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange tried to engage with the authorities, including a meeting on January 8 in Abuja, where it was confronted with criminal allegations.\n\nTeng said despite multiple requests, Binance has still not received details of the allegations, \"and our employees, therefore, inquired if there was an opportunity to submit our responses in writing and in the absence of a public hearing\".\n\n\"There were a number of reasons for that, including the sensitivity of the information and getting the opportunity to see the allegations in full and prepare a thorough substantive response,\" he said.\n\n\"The meeting ended with the Chair confirming they would consider the matter and revert through Binance's local counsel.\n\n\"However, as our employees were leaving the venue, they were approached by unknown persons who suggested to them to make a payment in settlement of the allegations.\n\n\"Later that day, our local counsel -- representing us at that time -- was summoned by the Committee through someone purporting to be their agent, who relayed the Committee's terms and instructed our local counsel to advise us.\n\n\"Counsel reported back that he had been presented with a demand for a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away and that our decision was expected by the morning.\n\n\"Our team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed.\"\n\nTeng said the payment request was declined \"via our counsel, not viewing it to be a legitimate settlement offer\".\n\nThe CEO said Binance clarified that it would engage in settlement negotiations on the conditions that the relevant petition or the details of all allegations were seen.\n\nIn addition, he said any settlement \"must be official, recorded in writing, and signed by all relevant parties\".", "source": {"uri": "thecable.ng",

has disclosed.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Binance, Richard Teng, made the startling disclosure on Tuesday in a blog post.\n\nTeng said the bribery was demanded in digital currency, adding that the government officials that made the request assured Binance that their problems would \"go away\" once the payment is made.\n\nHe, however, disclosed that Binance legal representative declined the offer from those undisclosed officials.\n\nTeng and other Binance executives have maintained the allegations were Unfounded and illegal and vowed not to be railroaded into making any illegal

and foreign exchange rate manipulations.\n\nSpeaking on Binance's issues with the Nigerian government, Teng explained how the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange made an attempt to engage with the authorities, including a meeting on January 8 in Abuja, where it was confronted with criminal allegations.\n\nThe Binance CEO said that despite requests, the crypto firm has still not received details of the allegations, saying, \"And our employees, therefore, inquired if there was an opportunity to submit our responses in writing and in the absence of a public hearing\".\n\n\"There were a number of reasons for that, including the sensitivity of the information and getting the opportunity to see the allegations in full and prepare a thorough substantive response,\" he said.\n\n\"The meeting

someone purporting to be their agent, who relayed the Committee's terms and instructed our local counsel to advise us.\n\n\"Counsel reported back that he had been presented with a demand for a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away and that our decision was expected by the morning.\n\n\"Our team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed.\"\n\nTeng said the payment request was declined \"via our counsel, not viewing it to be a legitimate settlement offer\".\n\nThe CEO said Binance

This development comes amidst a broader crackdown that includes the arrest of two Binance executives.\n\nIndeed, Nigerian regulators' enforcement is escalating tensions within the crypto sector. It also stirs concerns among global crypto entities about the regulatory environment in the region.\n\nEmomotimi Agama, Director General of the SEC, expressed serious concerns about the effects of P2P trading on the Nigerian naira. Agama emphasized the urgency of these measures to stabilize the national currency.\n\n\"The thing that needs to be done is delisting the naira from the P2P space in order to avoid the level of manipulation that is currently happening. [...] Recent concerns regarding crypto P2P traders and their perceived impact on the exchange rate of the naira has underscored the need for collective action,\" Agama said.\n\nPeer-to-peer platforms allow direct trading between crypto investors and bypass intermediaries. Therefore, the method may have raised concerns for the regulators in Nigeria.\n\nAdditionally, Nigerian officials have previously alleged that Binance and several other crypto exchanges engaged in fixing dollar prices. These prices did not refer to the price of the Nigerian naira at the central bank.\n\nThis ultimately made speculators take a chance and make prices on crypto exchanges the standard price used for foreign exchange trading. The issue is particularly noteworthy, considering Nigeria has been battling with inflation.\n\nRead more: How to Protect Yourself From Inflation Using Cryptocurrency\n\nAs Nigeria grapples with economic instability, the SEC's approach aims to rein in activities perceived as threats to financial security. This initiative extends to upcoming regulations targeting crypto exchanges and digital asset custodians.\n\nThe regulatory body's aggressive posture was highlighted earlier this year following the ban on Binance operations and the subsequent detention of its top executives, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla. Although Anjarwalla managed to flee, Gambaryan has been arrested in Abuja. He is also facing charges, including tax evasion and money laundering, which will lead him to go on trial this month.\n\nIn response to the ongoing case between the company and the Nigerian SEC, Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, has publicly demanded Gambaryan's release. In an open letter published on May 7, Teng criticizes the Nigerian authorities for setting a \"dangerous precedent\" for global corporate engagements. Furthermore, Teng defended Gambaryan's integrity and professional background, particularly his global contributions to combating financial crime.\n\n\"It is important to note that Tigran did not go to Nigeria as a 'decision-maker,' nor a 'negotiator.' He was merely acting as a functional expert in financial crime and capacity building in policy discussions,\" Teng stated.\n\nRead more: 7 Best Binance Alternatives in 2024\n\nThis is not the first time Binance has publicly called for their executives' release.

28 as part of an investigation into alleged illegal activities and foreign exchange rate manipulation.\n\nThe detained individuals are Nadeem Anjarwalla, a 37-year-old British Kenyan who serves as Binance's regional manager for Africa, and Tigran Gambaryan, a 39-year-old US citizen who holds the position of Binance's head of financial crime compliance.\n\nAdditionally, the Nigerian government filed a criminal charge against Binance for \"tax evasion\" on March 25, coinciding with Anjarwalla's escape from detention.\n\nIn discussing Binance's challenges with the Nigerian government, Teng outlined the efforts made by the leading cryptocurrency exchange to communicate with the authorities.\n\nThis included a meeting held on January 8 in Abuja, during which Binance faced accusations of criminal activity.\n\nDespite numerous requests, Binance has not yet provided specific details regarding these allegations.\n\nConsequently, the company's employees inquired about submitting written responses in lieu of a public hearing.\n\n\"There were a number of reasons for that, including the sensitivity of the information and getting the opportunity to see the allegations in full and prepare

Despite Binance's proactive efforts to seek guidance, they have received no response. Moreover, Binance asserts that no Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) has been licensed under these regulations till date.\n\nCryptocurrency Bribery Allegations: Binance's Account vs. Nigerian Denials\n\nIn early 2024, during discussions with Nigerian officials, Binance claims they were approached with a demand for a significant cryptocurrency payment to settle unspecified allegations. Nigeria denied these bribery allegations, dismissing them as tactics to divert attention from Binance's activities.\n\nAlso read: Tigran Detained!? Binance CEO Demands Release of Employee in Nigeria\n\nNigeria's Response: Dismissing Bribery Claims as Diversionary Tactics\n\nNigeria's Information Ministry spokesperson, Rabiu Ibrahim, rejected Binance CEO's bribery allegations as baseless and claimed they were part of an orchestrated effort to deflect attention. Ibrahim also characterized these allegations as part of Binance's strategy to divert attention from its activities. The Nigerian government firmly denied any involvement in bribery attempts. It accused Binance of making fictional claims and conducting media campaigns to improve its reputation amid ongoing criminal prosecutions in multiple countries.\n\nCryptocurrency Scrutiny in Nigeria: Addressing Naira Depreciation and Regulatory Adjustments\n\nThe dispute unfolds amidst Nigeria's intensified scrutiny of cryptocurrencies, fueled partly by concerns over the depreciation of the local currency, the naira.\n\nThe currency's decline is partly attributed to adjustments in foreign exchange controls and increased volatility managed by the Nigerian authorities. The SEC has banned person-to-person crypto trading involving the naira to address these concerns. Additionally, they have hinted at forthcoming regulations to govern the sector.\n\nHowever, Binance has yet to respond to Nigeria's accusations and denials, leaving uncertainty about Tigran Gambaryan's future and the implications of Binance's operations in Nigeria.\n\nBNB's Positive Trading Despite Turmoil\n\nDespite the turmoil, BNB, Binance's native token, continues to experience positive trading at $600, with an 8.3% increase last week.

cryptocurrency bribe to halt ongoing investigations against the company.\n\nTensions are increasing between Nigerian authorities and Binance, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, as the Nigerian government refutes allegations of bribery levelled by Binance's CEO, Richard Teng.\n\nIn a recent blog post, Teng accused unidentified Nigerian officials of demanding a $150 million cryptocurrency bribe to halt ongoing investigations against the company.\n\nNigerian Information Ministry spokesperson Rabiu Ibrahim dismissed these claims, calling them baseless and a part of a larger scheme aimed at undermining the country's legal proceedings.\n\nThe rift between Nigeria and Binance deepened after criminal charges were brought against the exchange and two of its executives, citing tax evasion and money laundering exceeding $35 million.\n\nDespite Binance's vigorous defence against these charges, Tigran Gambaryan, the company's head of financial crime compliance, remains in custody, while Nadeem Anjarwalla, a British-Kenyan executive, has fled the country.\n\nThe Nigerian government perceives Binance's bribery allegations as an attempt to divert attention from the serious legal consequences that the company faces within the country.\n\nAccording to Ibrahim, Nigeria maintains that Binance is under investigation for facilitating money laundering, terrorism financing, and illegal foreign exchange manipulation through its platform.\n\nHe said that the government will uphold the rule of law and ensure accountability, dismissing Binance's accusations as a manoeuvre to evade accountability for criminal activities.\n\nThe Nigerian authorities assert that Binance's bribery claims are part of a bigger campaign to discredit ongoing investigations, drawing parallels with similar legal challenges encountered by the exchange in the US.\n\nWhile Binance refrained from commenting on Nigeria's rebuttal, the exchange previously criticised the Nigerian government's handling of the situation.\n\nBinance highlighted concerns over the detention of its executives following purported discussions with Nigerian officials, characterising it as a crackdown on the crypto industry.", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5,

Binance CEO Aims to Clear Up Legal and Regulatory Mess Left by Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao", "body": "After Binance came under a Justice Department investigation and its founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) pleaded guilty to financial crimes, the crypto exchange elevated the CEO of its Singapore arm, Richard Teng, to the top job.\n\nFive months later, CZ is facing a four-month prison sentence for overseeing Binance's anti-money laundering failures in the US. But Teng's work reinventing the firm has only just begun.\n\nBinance Remains Dogged by Controversy\n\nJust as CZ's legal saga comes to a conclusion, Binance has found itself embroiled in a fresh controversy. This time in Nigeria.\n\nEchoing the earlier US charges, Nigerian authorities have accused the firm of money laundering and tax evasion, arresting 2 senior executives and sparking an ongoing crisis for the company.\n\nIn the latest development, Teng has called for the release of Binance's Head of Financial Crime Compliance, Tigran Gambaryan.\n\nGambaryan initially met with Nigerian authorities to discuss allegations of illegal business conduct made by the government. It was at one of these meetings that he and fellow Binance executive Nadeem Anjarwalla were arrested.\n\nAlthough Anjarwalla fled the country in March, Gambaryan remains in custody.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 7, Teng said: \"To invite a company's mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them, has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide.\"\n\nWith many uncertainties surrounding the government's allegations, the Nigerian debacle undermines Teng's attempts to turn over a new leaf in Binance's post-Zhao era.\n\nRichard Teng's Background in Compliance\n\nIn his recent blog post, Teng said: \"Since I assumed the role of CEO of Binance, I have made it a key commitment to work with global regulators and enforcement agencies to uphold the integrity of the global financial system.\"\n\nBefore joining Binance, Teng had a successful career on the other side of the regulatory divide, working for the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Abu Dabi's Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSMA).\n\nHe also spent time as chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX).\n\nHowever, no amount of experience as a regulator or compliance officer can change the fact that Teng inherited a mess.\n\nThe Legacy of the CZ Era\n\nIf Binance is to successfully rebrand itself as a fully compliant, licensed crypto exchange, the allegations facing its Nigerian operations aren't the only challenge Teng faces.\n\nAfter pulling out of the UK market following the implementation of new crypto advertising rules in October, Binance's attempts at reentry have been repeatedly foiled by a hostile financial regulator.\n\nMeanwhile, since suspending fiat deposits last year, Binance US has become a ghost of its former self, with no indication that the company plans a relaunch any time soon.\n\nOther countries where the crypto exchange has partly or completely withdrawn its services include Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Japan and Thailand.\n\nIn each instance, markets where it was previously able to operate without a license have ramped up oversight of the crypto sector, throwing a spanner in the works for Binance's sprawling offshore structure.\n\nOf course, there have been some wins for the company during Teng's tenure. A full virtual-asset services provider (VASP) license in Dubai , for example.\n\nBut progress is inevitably slow. And the company's reputation for clashing with regulators surely doesn't help.", "source": {"uri": "ccn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CCN - Capital & Celeb News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_morales@ccn.com", "name": "James Morales", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changpeng_Zhao", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Changpeng Zhao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_financial_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Global financial system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Authority_of_Singapore", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Authority of Singapore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiat money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Financial_Consultants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Financial Consultants", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Education and Training", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/who-is-richard-teng-binance-s-new-ceo-outlines-his-vision.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1213, "textEnd": 1218}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

CEO Richard Teng has called out the Nigerian government for detaining Tigran Gambaryan for more than 70 days as a scapegoat. In a blog post, Teng has called for an unconditional release of Gambaryan for the Nigerian detention as he is innocent.\n\n\"To invite a company's mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them, has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide,\" Teng noted.\n\nThe Nigerian government is attempting to follow in the footsteps of the United States government, which fined Binance more than $4 billion and sentenced its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, to four months. Most experts have downplayed reports of the Nigerian government requesting $10 billion from Binance as a fine.\n\nThe Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) have remained quiet. Furthermore, NFIU ostensibly communicated with Binance using unofficial channels, which resulted in Gambaryan's detention earlier this year.\n\nHowever, Teng has clarified that Tigran did not go to Nigeria as a decision-maker, not a negotiator but as a functional expert in financial crime and capacity building in policy discussions.\n\nThe Nigerian government has blamed the rising demand for cryptocurrency assets on the deteriorating state of the national currency. As of this writing, the Nigerian Naira traded around 1,383 for a single US dollar.\n\nAs a control measure, the Nigerian SEC has proposed some regulatory changes, including a blanket ban on persons-to-persons alias P2P transactions involving the Naira.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fintech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changpeng_Zhao", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Changpeng Zhao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Financial_Crimes_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic and Financial Crimes Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiat money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peer-to-peer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://image.coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/23190443/SEC-Plays-the-Long-Game-Expert-Reveals-Secret-Strategy-Against-Binance.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

There has been much public commentary on this episode, and I wanted to take this opportunity to provide the facts so that the global community's perception may not be distorted unfairly. I also feel that it's time to speak out about this issue on behalf of the global business community. To invite a company's mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them, has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide.\n\nI want to start by sharing a bit about Tigran, a person I've gotten to know well, and admire deeply, since I joined Binance. The greatest irony and most unfortunate fact is that a highly valued global financial crime fighter, who is professionally recognized by his peers in both the private and public sectors, has been detained in Nigeria for more than two months for spurious reasons.\n\nTigran has devoted his professional life to fighting financial crimes. Tigran's decade as a federal cop was documented in a book called, Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, and we put out this blog a few weeks ago to share more about his illustrious career fighting crime.\n\nHe joined Binance after his time working for the U.S. IRS as a Special Agent to continue the work he started. He recognized that he could do even more good working for the largest company in this nascent industry to keep out bad actors and uphold market integrity. Anyone who has left public service for a private organization can tell you that sometimes you can make an even greater positive impact working for a private company that has an extraordinary scale.\n\nGiven this background, Tigran was hired in 2021 to help Binance develop and build stronger compliance controls, specific to law enforcement cooperation and stopping financial crime. As the head of Binance's Financial Crime Compliance (FCC) team, he has been a strong advocate for Binance to develop policies and build compliance capabilities that set new industry standards. In 2022 and 2023, Tigran's Financial Crime Compliance team assisted global law enforcement in freezing and seizing more than $2.2B worth of assets, including more than $285M in cooperation with United States agencies like the FBI, DOJ, DEA, and others.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that Tigran did not go to Nigeria as a \"decision-maker,\" nor a \"negotiator.\" He was merely acting as a functional expert in financial crime and capacity building in policy discussions.\n\nI think it's important to go back a couple of years to help provide a clearer picture of our activities in Nigeria. In fact, this story started nearly two years ago.\n\nIn May 2022, Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published regulations for digital assets, bringing cryptocurrency under its purview. The regulations required crypto exchanges operating in Nigeria to obtain a permit from the SEC and comply with certain requirements. However, the regulations failed to articulate some of the key licensing requirements (e.g. application process, licensing fees, etc.), making it practically impossible to apply for a license.\n\nBinance proactively reached out to the SEC on several occasions to seek practical guidance on the licensing process and offer to engage with the Nigerian authorities on a consultative basis.\n\nFor example, in a letter dated 22 June 2022, Binance stated that it \"would welcome and be grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with the SEC and other industry players in the blockchain coalition over the coming days to provide further clarity on the application of the new rules, particularly around the interaction of these rules vis-\u00e0-vis the position taken by the Central Bank of Nigeria, the fee structure for licensing, and the impact of the registration on the facilitation of bank accounts in the region.\"\n\nHowever, Binance never received any response from the SEC. To our knowledge, no Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) has been licensed under the new regulations to this date.\n\nAlmost a year later, on 9 June 2023, the SEC published a circular on its website to warn the Nigerian public against the activities of the Binance exchange and direct Binance to immediately stop soliciting Nigerian investors. The circular stated: \"Binance Nigeria Limited is neither registered nor regulated by the Commission and its operations in Nigeria are therefore illegal... By this circular, Binance Nigeria Limited is hereby directed to immediately stop soliciting Nigerian investors in any form whatsoever.\"\n\nThe reference in the circular to 'Binance Nigeria Limited' was incorrect. Binance Nigeria Limited is not affiliated with Binance and was registered by third parties in violation of the Binance trademark and for arbitrage purposes if Binance wished to establish a local presence in Nigeria. However, it was clear that the SEC's intention was to target the Binance exchange.\n\nRecognizing that the intent was to serve this notice on the authentic Binance exchange, Binance immediately suspended solicitation activities in Nigeria, including paid ads, SEO, online and offline events, as well as all targeted communications to users. Those restrictions are still in place to date.\n\nIn the letter we sent the SEC at that time, we reiterated that Binance was \"fully committed to cooperating with the Commission and complying with the relevant regulations\" and requested a meeting with the SEC (noting that a previous meeting had been requested by Binance but that no response had been received from the SEC).\n\nAgain, the SEC did not respond. We've continued to engage constructively with the SEC by providing commentary on their amended regulations as recently as March 29, 2024.\n\nIn August 2023, we decided to engage through Nigeria's digital assets industry. We began supporting the Digital Currency Coalition (DCC), an industry association comprising leading local and foreign digital asset service providers in Nigeria, promoting regulatory engagement and lobbying for the introduction of crypto regulations.\n\nIn November 2023, we did what we do with law enforcement organizations all over the world: Binance conducted law enforcement training for the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) and Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Not only have these efforts helped uplevel cryptocurrency-related crime-fighting efforts around the world but they serve as a critical relationship-building tool for Tigran's team to work more closely with law enforcement.\n\nIn early December 2023, Binance received a letter from the Chairman of the House Committee on Financial Crimes (HCFC) requesting that we appear at a public investigative hearing in less than two weeks.\n\nUltimately, through informal channels, we managed to agree with the Committee that the hearing should be rescheduled to 10 January 2024, to provide a realistic timeline to prepare and send a delegation of Binance employees with expertise on the issues that were important to discuss.\n\nTigran Gambaryan and several other members of our team traveled to Nigeria to participate in this and other meetings. On January 5, Binance employees met with the NFIU to discuss information sharing as well as continued capacity building. The agreed next step was for the FIU to share a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) setting out proposed terms and conditions for the sharing of anti-money laundering (AML)-related information.\n\nOn January 8, Binance employees had a face-to-face meeting with three members of the HCFC and a clerk in Abuja at the House of Representatives building for a scheduled pre-hearing engagement in private. The meeting was chaired by the Honourable Peter Akpanke, the Honourable Philip Agbese, and the Honourable Peter Aniekwe, as well as a clerk.\n\nDuring the conversation, the Committee highlighted the important nature of the issues at hand and the lengths to which they were prepared to go to summon Binance, including issuing arrest warrants against our team and CEO and preventing our team from leaving the country. While concerning, it was understood that the HCFC does not in fact have the power to issue arrest warrants.\n\nThe Committee confirmed that the public hearing would proceed on the 10th of January and that Binance would be afforded an opportunity to respond to any allegations publicly in the presence of the petitioners, press, and over 30 agencies.\n\nDespite multiple requests, Binance had still not received details of the allegations, and our employees, therefore, inquired if there was an opportunity to submit our responses in writing and in the absence of a public hearing. There were a number of reasons for that, including the sensitivity of the information and getting the opportunity to see the allegations in full and prepare a thorough substantive response. The meeting ended with the Chair confirming they would consider the matter and revert through Binance's local counsel.\n\nHowever, as our employees were leaving the venue, they were approached by unknown persons who suggested to them to make a payment in settlement of the allegations. Later that day, our local counsel -- representing us at that time -- was summoned by the Committee through someone purporting to be their agent, who relayed the Committee's terms and instructed our local counsel to advise us. Counsel reported back that he had been presented with a demand for a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away and that our decision was expected by the morning. Our team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed. We, of course, declined the payment demand via our counsel, not viewing it to be a legitimate settlement offer, and clarified that we would engage in settlement negotiations on the following conditions:\n\nOur counsel relayed Binance's conditions, to which initially objection was taken. However, we were informed by our counsel that the Committee eventually agreed to the above.\n\nSoon after returning from the trip, the NFIU shared the draft MoU, which scopes out Binance's undertaking to voluntarily file SARs/STRs, provide training to Nigerian and other regional law enforcement agencies, and for both parties to cooperate with each other. We saw this as a positive development in the effort to cooperate on making crypto safer and free of criminal activity.\n\nOn February 5, a Binance advisor with deep local connections advised a meeting with the director of the Office of National Security Advisor (ONSA) who would become the central gateway for Binance to have its presence in Nigeria. Again, we saw this as a positive development because rather than dealing with multiple agencies/departments, we would be able to focus communications through one very senior and respected pillar of Nigeria's law enforcement community.\n\nIn early February, our team was communicating with ONSA and EFCC regarding opportunities for a meeting. In one of these emails, we explained the \"pivotal role (we play) in global law enforcement efforts. We engage in partnerships with law enforcement agencies worldwide, undertaking joint investigations and offering support wherever necessary. Notably, we have established a strong and productive relationship with our counterparts in Nigeria, including the EFCC.\" The meeting agenda proposed by Binance included the following items:\n\nA meeting was scheduled for February 26, 2024, at 2pm at ONSA's offices in Abuja, Nigeria. It was confirmed that the following government representatives would be in attendance: the National Security Advisor; the Chief Executive of the SEC; and, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nDespite the clear risks, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla (Head of Binance Africa) received multiple assurances that they would be granted safe passage for their meetings.\n\nAt around this time, the naira (NGN), the Nigerian currency, was amid a steep decline, amounting to what some watchers referred to as the worst financial crisis in a generation. While many crypto platforms operate in Nigeria -- and continue to do so to this day -- Binance was the leading crypto platform operating in Nigeria at the time, and Nigerian traders were using the P2P product on the Binance platform to protect themselves against the currency decline. We began hearing concerns that the P2P NGN prices from merchant advertisements had influenced the country's foreign exchange rate.\n\nBinance's P2P team engaged with the local community. What we learned was that due to the lack of official reference FX prices in Nigeria, people in Nigeria, including crypto and non-crypto players, were using the price averages of the P2P advertisements as a source of FX rate reference.\n\nWhile the P2P market advertisement price (quotation price) is real-time and moves along with the market, it is not always a reflection of the actual traded price. Binance has no role in setting the P2P prices: in fact, P2P transactions are driven by individuals seeking to engage in direct buying and selling of particular crypto-to-crypto or fiat-to-crypto pairs. It's essentially a marketplace for crypto.\n\nThe P2P product does not have the same level of usage or the same depth of market and liquidity as the centralized exchange. Due to lower liquidity and higher volatility, people may see quotation spikes in the P2P market that do not necessarily represent real-world asset pricing, and quotations do not even lead to a trade necessarily. Part of the local community in Nigeria viewed those spikes as potential price manipulation, and given the wide usage of the P2P advertisement prices by merchants as FX rate reference, some suggested that Binance was a factor in the country's volatile FX rate and currency depreciations.\n\nThe reality, of course, is that contributing factors of FX rates are complex and largely driven by macroeconomic policies. Here are a couple of helpful links on that topic:\n\nAt the same time, our P2P team continued to work on several initiatives including removing abnormally priced ads, applying restrictions to relevant users, and separate controls for buy/sell limits. There were also intentions to add a last-traded price feed so quotation spikes would no longer be viewed as market prices. Below are a couple of blogs we put out at the time to make it clear that we are dedicated to providing a market-driven, fraud-free, and manipulation-free platform for users. The fact remains: we take our responsibility to protect users very seriously. To reinforce the point, we made it clear that if users are behaving in a malicious or manipulative way, they will be removed from the platform.\n\nOn February 26, Tigran and Nadeem traveled to Nigeria and were present for the meetings they had scheduled and, as stated above, received multiple assurances for their safety. In their first meeting, they met with leaders from ONSA, the office of the President, the Central Bank, NFIU, EFCC, and the SEC.\n\nThe tone of the meeting was neutral -- neither friendly nor hostile -- and it seemed that overall progress was being made during the two hours or so that the meeting lasted.\n\nOne of the EFCC leaders, with whom Tigran had built a relationship over the last several months, took them aside and told them that everything was progressing well and that Tigran and Nadeem had no need to worry. The Binance employees were told that a further meeting would take place shortly after, this time involving the most senior leaders from ONSA, CBN, SEC, and the Ministry of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy.\n\nAfter waiting more than two hours, the Binance employees were invited back into a meeting room albeit with different attendees than the ones announced -- specifically, there were four members of the EFCC.\n\nThe leader of the group took on a hostile approach. He said that the issues involving Binance were of national security and made the following demands:\n\nThey further explained that, until such time as Binance would fulfill these requests, Tigran and Nadeem would be their \"guests\" and be moved for \"security reasons\" to a house in a high-security compound. Additionally, they requested that Tigran and Nadeem hand over their passports.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Tigran and Nadeem were escorted to their hotel, asked to pack their belongings, and moved to the secure compound, which was controlled by ONSA. Their mobile phones were confiscated, and it was made clear to them that they were not free to leave. Both Nadeem and Tigran had no control over when and with whom they spoke.\n\nFrom this point on, Tigran (a US citizen) and Nadeem (a British-Kenyan citizen) were under detention. Both the UK High Commission and the US Embassy were alerted in the overnight hours of the detention of Tigran and Nadeem.\n\nThe next day, Binance's legal counsel sent an email to the leaders of ONSA asking them to \"urgently clarify the legal basis for the detention of [its] employees\" and noting that their respective nation's embassies (U.S. for Tigran and UK for Nadeem) had been notified. Our note further stated: \"We understand from our employees after conversations with you yesterday your main concern is the listing of the naira as a tradable asset on the Binance platform. This is the first time we have been made aware of this concern in relation to the listing of the naira on our platform. We are able to delist the naira from the Binance platform. However, we ask that you guarantee the immediate release of Tigran and Nadeem and that no restrictions will be placed on their movements, including their departure from Nigeria.\"\n\nThe same day, ONSA responded by email, stating that Tigran and Nadeem were their \"guests\" and treated with \"hospitality.\"\n\nWe also received confirmation that day that the U.S. and UK governments had been briefed on the situation and were following up closely.\n\nThe next 24 hours were marked by aggressive behavior towards Tigran and Nadeem where they were accused personally of holding responsibility for the state of the naira and the overall economy, and allegations of terrorist financing and money laundering.\n\nOn February 28, we removed the naira pairing from our site and shut down the P2P product for Nigeria on the Binance platform. We advised ONSA of our actions in an email and requested that Tigran and Nadeem be immediately provided with \"safe passage to the airport.\"\n\nNo official response from ONSA was received that day.\n\nOn this day, the same EFCC leader with whom Tigran had become close over the past few months broke down emotionally to Tigran. He apologized and said it was his wrongdoing as he had given Tigran and Nadeem his word that everything would be OK, and that the meeting was supposed to be a friendly one.\n\nSoon thereafter news of Tigran and Nadeem's detention broke in global media. Nearly a month later, on March 23, we learned that Nadeem left unlawful detention. From that point on, things went from bad to worse for Tigran.\n\nOn April 25, during a bail hearing for Tigran Gambaryan, the EFCC's prosecutor said to the court, \"The 1st defendant [Binance] is operating virtually. The only thing we have to hold on to is this defendant [Tigran].\"\n\nThe message from the Nigerian government is clear: we must detain an innocent, mid-level employee and a former U.S. federal agent, and place him in a dangerous prison in order to control Binance.\n\nSince I assumed the role of CEO of Binance, I have made it a key commitment to work with global regulators and enforcement agencies to uphold the integrity of the global financial system.\n\nOver the past two and a half years, Binance has worked hard to restructure our organization and personnel and upgrade our systems. We have new leadership in place with deep compliance experience and impressive backgrounds ranging from top traditional financial institutions and leading tech companies, to law enforcement and major corporate entities.\n\nToday, the Binance leadership team, including myself, report to a Board of Directors. The Board is responsible, as corporate steward, to safeguard the company's interests as well as make key decisions to ensure the long-term sustainability and viability of the business. It is through this process that we have become a stronger, safer, and even more compliant and secure platform for our users. We have evolved dramatically as a business.\n\nThis ordeal has been deeply distressing for Tigran, his family and friends, as well as the entire Binance community. As mentioned above, to remove any doubt about suggestions that we had played a role in the country's currency crisis and as a good faith gesture, I made the difficult decision earlier this month to turn off our P2P product on the Binance platform for Nigeria and end the trading of all naira pairs on the spot exchange product on the Binance platform. Our hope when we took this drastic step was that our colleagues would be released and Binance could continue to work with the Nigerian government to resolve any further concerns. Unfortunately, that didn't happen.\n\nWe continue to do anything and everything we can to support Tigran. This support is unwavering.\n\nLet Tigran go home to his family, and then Binance will work through the same process that we have done with Nigeria's law enforcement community voluntarily more than 600 times in the past. We will always work to protect innocent users, and bad actors are not welcome on our platform. We will work tirelessly with public and private partners to remove them. Furthermore, we will continue engagement with Nigeria's Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on resolving potential historic tax liabilities.\n\nIt remains unclear to me as to why this is not a solution to which the Nigerian government officials are willing to agree. The Nigerian government has extraordinary power to determine the future of Binance and the broader crypto industry within its borders. At the end of the day, Binance wants to have a future where we work alongside the Nigerian government to be part of building a strong economy for the Nigerian people. But this crisis must come to a resolution quickly, and Tigran must be allowed to go home if we're going to move forward.\n\nBinance remains committed to embracing the opportunity that lies with taking an innovative approach to using digital assets and platforms but we also must build a future where we are seen, as we see ourselves, as good actors in the international community.\n\nI'd like to express my deepest gratitude for the many notes of support we have received from around the world in response to this crisis, and I hope that my next update is one where our employees are safe at home with their families.", "source": {"uri": "binance.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "binance.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score":

There has been a claim pending against this company since the beginning of February.\n\nThe tension that exists between the protection of multinational corporate workers and the onslaught that the Nigerian government is undertaking against bitcoin businesses was brought to light by the blog post that Teng published on Tuesday which called attention to the situation.\n\nTeng, on the other hand, can be Binance satisfied with the fact that Gambaryan has a proven history of successfully tackling financial wrongdoing in the past.\n\nThis includes his prior role as an agent for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States of America, as well as his attempts to work together with law enforcement agencies from all over the world in order to freeze and reclaim assets that are worth more than $2.2 billion.\n\nAfter that, Teng continued by stating that Gambaryan was in Nigeria in order to consider policy, not to bargain, and he was not there to bargain.\n\n\"To invite and then to detain mid-level employees of a company for long times for the purpose of participating in a collaborative policy meeting has established a perilous precedent that affects all businesses throughout the world,\" Teng commented.\n\nAfter Gambaryan was arrested on Binance suspicion of the organization's involvement in unlawful financial operations on February 26, the disenchantment between Gambaryan, an employee of Binance, and the Nigerian authorities became more intense as a result of Gambaryan's detention.\n\nA search warrant was issued for Gambaryan on February 26 in relation to those allegations. On the basis of suspicions that the group was involved in illicit financial activities, Gambaryan was taken into custody on the basis of suspicion that he was responsible for the act.\n\nThe discovery is coincidental with the government's Binance preparation for a more robust regulatory push, in which the Nigerian government is preparing to shut down P2P cryptocurrency exchanges that use the Nigerian naira as their payment method.\n\nDue to the fact that this development coincides with the time at which the development occurred, this is a significant development.\n\nThe Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission is currently in the process of putting more legislation into place in order to protect the currency of the country from any potential manipulation that may occur.\n\nIn addition to allegations that have been made against Gambaryan, there have also been accusations of tax evasion, speculation in currencies, and money laundering. He has responded to these allegations by saying the following:\n\nSEE ALSO:", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multinational corporation"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Commission_(Nigeria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Securities and Exchange Commission (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peer-to-peer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.chiangraitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Binance.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-26", "textStart": 1856, "textEnd": 1867, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Nearly a month later, on March 23, we learned that Nadeem left unlawful detention. From that point on, things went from bad to worse for Tigran.\"\n\nRichard Teng\n\nTigran Gambaryan and his colleagues reportedly first visited Nigeria in early January as part of a delegation from Binance to participate in meetings with Nigerian authorities to address concerns and seek clarity on issues regarding crypto regulations and compliance requirements.\n\nThe outcome of those meetings remains uncertain. However, according to Teng, Gambaryan's team was approached \"by unknown persons who suggested they make a payment to settle the allegations\" upon their departure.

Binance equally will have every opportunity under the rule of law to make its case and see justice delivered,\" Mijinyawa said.\n\nAccording to The PUNCH, a prosecutor with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ekele Iheanacho, rejected Teng's allegation and pledged to prosecute the case until its conclusion.\n\nIheanacho, one of the lawyers prosecuting the Binance officials, said, ''Nobody demanded any money, the case is being taken to a logical conclusion. He's making it up, although I am not aware of any such allegations. As far as I am concerned, the charges are going on, and we are making every effort to ensure that we get to a logical end.''\n\nThe Media Adviser to the Attorney-General of the Federation, Kamarudeen Ogundele, referred inquiries to the information minister and the Presidency.\n\nSenior officials, speaking anonymously to The PUNCH, challenged the Binance CEO to disclose the identities of those allegedly involved in the bribery attempt.", "source": {"uri": "naijanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ikenna_ngere@naijanews.com", "name": "Ikenna Ngere", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_charge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal charge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Financial_Crimes_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic and Financial Crimes Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/nigeria-binance-768x384-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-08", "textStart": 485, "textEnd": 494}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-08", "textStart": 1754, "textEnd": 1761}], "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

invited the management of Binance on several occasions but the cryptocurrency firm sent legal representatives instead.\n\nIn one of the committee sittings in early March, the lawmakers turned back

The men were detained unexpectedly in February after coming to Nigeria to meet with officials about the crypto exchange's purported impact on the national currency.\n\nBinance CEO Richard Teng had been tight-lipped about the situation, including during an on-stage interview with Fortune's Leo Schwartz, but on Tuesday he published a blog post that provides a chronology of events and a plea for Gambaryan's freedom. Teng also used strong words to denounce the behavior of Nigeria's rulers.\n\n\"The message from the Nigerian government is clear: We must detain an innocent, mid-level employee and a former U.S. federal agent, and place him in a dangerous prison in order to control Binance,\" wrote Teng. \"To invite a company's mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them, has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide.\"\n\nCritics of the crypto industry may be tempted to blow off Teng's plea, pointing out that Binance for years behaved as a global scofflaw and that its founder just got sentenced to four months in U.S. federal prison. In other words, the company is getting what it deserves in Nigeria. This position grossly misses the point, though, since it overlooks Binance's recent efforts to pursue compliance and, more importantly, it ignores the years of good work by Gambaryan.\n\nIn his blog post, Teng describes Gambaryan as a \"financial crime fighter.\" That's a fair description based on his work helping to take down notorious dark web sites while at the IRS and on his work at Binance, where he assisted with numerous counter-notorious investigations. Other cybersecurity figures have told me they have mixed feelings about Binance but regard Gambaryan as one of the good guys.\n\nThere is also the matter of Nigeria's leaders. I wrote in March about the leaders' decision to hold Gambaryan hostage, ridiculing the attempt to make crypto a scapegoat for their economic mismanagement. I also pointed to an FT report that Nigerian officials had asked Binance for a $10 billion pay-off -- a report that is collaborated by Teng's blog post. In response, I got angry emails from Nigerians accusing me of racism or colonial behavior...or something.

In a blog post, Teng has called for an unconditional release of Gambaryan for the Nigerian detention as he is innocent.\n\n\"To invite a company's mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them, has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide,\" Teng noted.\n\nThe Nigerian government is attempting to follow in the footsteps of the United States government, which fined Binance more than $4 billion and sentenced its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, to four months. Most experts have downplayed reports of the Nigerian government requesting $10 billion from Binance as a fine.\n\nThe Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) have remained quiet. Furthermore, NFIU ostensibly communicated with Binance using unofficial channels, which resulted in Gambaryan's detention earlier this year.\n\nHowever, Teng has clarified that Tigran did not go to Nigeria as a decision-maker, not a negotiator but as a functional expert in financial crime and capacity building in policy discussions.\n\nThe Nigerian government has blamed the rising demand for cryptocurrency assets on the deteriorating state of the national currency. As of this writing, the Nigerian Naira traded around 1,383 for a single US dollar.\n\nAs a control measure, the Nigerian SEC has proposed some regulatory changes, including a blanket ban on persons-to-persons alias P2P transactions involving the Naira.", "source": {"uri": "coinpedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "qadir_ak@coinpedia.org", "name": "Qadir Ak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changpeng_Zhao", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Changpeng Zhao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Financial_Crimes_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic and Financial Crimes Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiat money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peer-to-peer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 63}], "image": "http://image.coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/23190443/SEC-Plays-the-Long-Game-Expert-Reveals-Secret-Strategy-Against-Binance.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545285", "eventUri": "eng-9545285", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

It is nothing but a diversionary tactic and an attempted act of blackmail by a company desperate to obfuscate the grievous criminal charges it is facing in Nigeria,\" the federal government said.\n\nIt reminded Binance of the fact that it was being investigated in Nigeria for allowing its platform to be used for money laundering, terrorism financing, and foreign exchange manipulation through illegal trading.\n\nThe statement stated further that: \"While this lawful investigation was going on, an executive of Binance, who was in court-sanctioned protective custody, escaped from Nigeria, and he is now a fugitive from the law. Working with the security agencies in Nigeria, Interpol is currently executing an international arrest warrant on the said fugitive.\"\n\nIt accused Binance saying the phantom bribe claim was part of an orchestrated international campaign by the company currently charged with criminal prosecution in many countries, including the United States, to undermine the Nigerian government.\n\nThe statement recalled that just a week ago, the founder and former CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, was sentenced to prison in the United States, after pleading guilty to charges very similar to what Binance was being investigated for in Nigeria.\n\nHouse Probes Escape of Binance Executive\n\nThe House of Representatives has launched an investigation into the sudden disappearance and escape of Binance Executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla from the custody of the National Security Adviser (NSA).\n\nThe resolution of the House was sequel to the adoption of a motion of urgent national importance moved at plenary by Hon. Dominic Okafor.\n\nThe lawmaker expressed concern that persons suspected to have committed such atrocious crimes against Nigeria with already over-burdened security challenges were kept in a guest house in Abuja instead of lawful custody of the Department of State Service or any other approved custodial facility.\n\nHe decried that the escape of the Binance executive from the office of the NSA using a \"Smuggled Passport\" was, to say the least, most disappointing, embarrassing and disturbing as it portrays the porosity of the security architecture of the country to the world.\n\nIn another development, the House has called for police/security presence in schools across the nation and to address the worsening security situation in the country.\n\nThe House made the call following the adoption of a motion of urgent public importance moved at the plenary on Wednesday by Hon. Billy Osawaru.\n\nThe call was not be unconnected to the rate of kidnappings and wanton destruction of lives and property across the schools in the country since 2014.\n\nThe House lamented students are no longer safe even in their schools especially in places like Borno, Nasarawa, Niger, Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna States.\n\nOsawaru recalled that on Thursday, 7th of March 2024, about 287 schoolchildren were kidnapped from a government-owned school in Kaduna State's Kuriga town.\n\nHe said before then, on Friday, 22nd of September 2023, about 24 students of the Federal University of Gusau in Zamfara State were kidnapped by bandits.\n\nThe lawmaker added that in Nigeria, policemen are not guarding most of the schools despite the level of attacks frequently experienced by the schools and the ones in existence are not sufficient in manpower and equipment, hence the level losses incurred any time such attacks occurred.\n\nOsawaeu warned; \"If no drastic measure is taken to curb the escalating insecurity situation in the country and in the schools, the entire schools may end up being shut down due to the activities of these miscreants and hoodlums.\"\n\nThe House, therefore, mandated its Committees on Army, Airforce, Navy, Police Affairs and Defence to interface with all security Chiefs to identify how best to secure the schools and proffer immediate lasting solutions to the security challenges in the country.\n\nIt also mandated schools to engage the services of Private Security outfits to complement the efforts of the security agencies in securing the schools.", "source": {"uri": "thisdaylive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THISDAYLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5,

Not even for one second. Not at all. I know officials of the current Nigerian administration, who are some of the finest specimens of gentlemanliness,\" he added.\n\nStating that he had just returned from Nigeria, Arnold challenged Binance officials to come clean with the officials demanding the bribe from it instead of splashing mud on every Nigerian official.\n\nThe mayor said: \"However, I will give Binance the benefit of the doubt and ask them not to make blanket allegations, but to mention names. Who demanded bribes. Surely not ghosts. They must have names. Mentionable names.

At different points along the way, different agents claiming to be 'Binance' have been conducting business in Nigeria, only for Binance itself, authorities, or both to come forward disowning and distancing themselves from various activities associated with the name 'Binance'\n\nAt one stage there could have been the question - 'Will the real 'Binance' please stand up?'\n\nI've stayed out of this argument up to now, as I am no big fan of Binance.\n\nI am of the view some Eth based developments, especially ERC 20 spawned some income strands that have brought the cryptocurrency/blockchain/web3 business into serious disrepute. Binance is heavily leveraged on EVM Compatibility for its success.\n\nWeaknesses and exploit conditions of multiple kinds exist wherever there are '0x' strings and Solidity code, irrespective of if they are in stand-alone solutions, linked to Ethereum, or extending exotic cross-architecture services with other things.\n\nBinance in particular has been mired in disputes. The previous leader was forced to step down. Changpeng Zhao, a Canadian citizen born in China, was recently jailed for four months in Seattle.\n\nIn a separate statement Anton Golub said Changpeng Zhao (with a wealth of $33 billion) is now the richest person ever sent to a US prison\n\nNevertheless, this is not a case of holding oil personnel to ransom as in the last millennium. Our sector is a very fluid one, and (except a tiny club around Zhao), the links between operatives and any notion of corporate family or corporate responsibility ceases to exist.\n\nFirstly, it's important to understand in the EFCC context, Binance has merely been a service tool, presiding over 'instruments' through which unconnected parties can store 'value' or trade.\n\nThere is an old saying about 'If only this 100 dollar bill could tell a story'... instruments leveraged through Binance are no different. What would happen if EFCC could prove $USD had been used by Nigerians in the conduct of illegal criminal activities? Whether Federal Reserve have knowledge of it or not, is not an issue. They can't NOT be aware, cases of $USD being used in illegal criminal activities is a matter of public record since time immemorial! Do EFCC go after Federal Reserve (its retail actors/distributors or agents)? Well I'd like to see how that works out for them. Simply being 'easier' to go after a corporate rather than sovereign target for the same thing, doesn't make it OK.\n\nWhat people also routinely 'forget' in reporting was that at one stage EFCC legal custody expired and despite the absence of judicial authority, retained custody anyway.\n\nThat, purely on its own, is enough to force case dismissal, complete with double jeopardy clause, completely irrespective of cast iron strength around what can otherwise be proven.\n\nOther reports hint at inter agency rivalry between EFCC and FIRS (Federal Inland Revenue Service). FIRS lawyer, Moses Ideho, claimed they made attempts to charge Tigran Gambaryan while in EFCC custody in Abuja and were denied access.\n\nJournalistic narratives paint pictures of clandestine 'devious' methods of 'escape' during the window, however, this tells more about feelings of safety, and confidence in 'due process' and authorities in Nigeria, than it does about culpability of those detained.\n\nWhat is new, is a quote from Samuel Nwite's article yesterday.\n\nRichard Teng, CEO; dropped the clanger: \"To invite a company's mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them\" has set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide,\"\n\nThis is a bit of where my mind has been headed all along.\n\n'Mid Level?' What a gross embellishment! They are far less significant to Binance than that!\n\nNow some may say, if the Job Title fits, wear it.\n\nBut, over decades of work in Nigeria and exposure to privileged corporate content, I've seen past Expatriate Quota records where job titles created for NIS (Nigerian Immigration Service) consumption have little or no bearing on what many foreign employees actually do for their employers day to day. Some records are so bizarre they make works of pure Science Fiction read like Empirical Truths.\n\nHaving spent so long in the 'Global South' expatriate space, I've learnt that North American and European businesses over time have learnt to 'protect' themselves by not assigning from the domestic job pool to 'Global South' territories where they have strong intel, there is a risk of relationships with authorities 'going south'. They are afraid of domestic rights laws. Some Chinese businesses on the other hand have equal worries, but mostly because corporate activities forced under the microscope of the Polit Bureau don't end well.\n\nIf they can't find the right non locals with tested metal in the field, they often source from South Asia, North Africa or The Middle East, who will have weaker legal redress against the company, and frankly, they view as being expendable, and will cut the lifeline on the first sign of local authorities starting to show 'interest'.\n\nIt's profoundly obvious the detained folk are absolutely nowhere in the Binance food chain.\n\nTigran Gambaryan, one of the detained, formally issued a decline of receiving 'legal service' on behalf of Binance. His legal representative, Mark Mordi, responded that Gambaryan doesn't posess the authority from Binance to represent them in the matter.\n\nGambaryan is just a corporate policy advisor and voluntarily came to Nigeria, accepting an invitation as a benign request. It clearly had ulterior hidden motives. This could only be got further wrong by arresting the dude that changes the roll in the Binance office toilet in Gambaryan's home of Armenia.\n\nIn court, Mr Mordi said his client declined to accept service of the charge on behalf of Binance because he is not a representative of the company in Nigeria.\n\nThe ruse began earlier this year, as the Naira to Dollar rate went into freefall with no obvious end in sight. Binance appeared as a fathomless scapegoat to the absence of strategic leadership responsible for the demise.\n\nTrying to tackle the vehicles of value movement is merely dealing with symptoms, and any that are removed will only make space for new ones to appear. Rather than looking to 'medicate' against symptoms, FGN and agencies need to address the PROBLEMS (which follow).\n\nFinancial Services Actors (such as Binance) have no role in tackling violet crime and terrorism; enabling reliable, plentiful and affordable electricity; removing corruption in civil authority ecosystems; strengthening agricultural and manufacturing output; and proportionately improving sovereign passport index, and attracting more FDI though improving 'Ease to Do Business' index.. all things that ACTUALLY impact the exchange rate.\n\nThere were other statements made by Teng alluding to approaches by authorities for Binance to pay a bribe for charges to 'go away'. These will not be dealt with here.\n\nHowever, this kind of 'wing and a prayer' 'grandstanding' by authorities costs taxpayers money to action and prosecute. They seem committed to lumping these burdens on the impoverished citizenry for the many ill thought-out ruses they lose, as they find something to selfishly 'eat' on the rare occasions they win.\n\nPreview our Sino Amazon/Sinosignia releases (Ente)", "source": {"uri": "tekedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tekedia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_mc_keown@tekedia.com", "name": "John Mc

CFTC Chair Predicts Enforcement Surge\n\nWhy It Matters: Gambaryan, along with Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance's regional manager for Africa, was detained after a meeting with high-level officials, including the CEO of the SEC, the deputy governor of the central bank, and the national security adviser.\n\nAnjarwalla escaped custody in March, while Gambaryan now faces money laundering charges and is held in Kuje prison, awaiting a postponed bail hearing.\n\nFurther complicating matters, The New York Times reported that Gambaryan was asked for a $150 million bribe in cryptocurrency during a visit in January, a claim that has added layers of complexity to the situation.\n\n\"Our team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed,\" Teng wrote, indicating that the bribe was declined through legal counsel.\n\nAmid these controversies, Nigeria has taken a firm stance against cryptocurrency, with plans to ban person-to-person (P2P) crypto trading in its national currency.\n\nThis decision, as announced by Emomotimi Agama, Director General of Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission, aims to curb what he described as manipulation within the P2P space.\n\nWhat's Next: As the global community watches these developments, the ongoing situation in Nigeria will likely be a topic of significant discussion at the upcoming Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.\n\nRead Next: $130B Asset Manager Hightower Makes Splash With $68M Spot Bitcoin ETF Purchase\n\nImage: Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com",

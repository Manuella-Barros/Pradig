It has been suggested that United are ready to listen to offers for the majority of their stars with Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund the only players untouchable at the moment.\n\nMan Utd are reportedly willing to cash-in on Aaron Wan-Bissaka and sign a new right-back as a potential replacement for the former Crystal Palace star this summer.\n\nWhile citing and translating the print version of Gazzetta dello Sport, Sport Witness has reported that Man Utd are interested in signing the Netherlands international and they could make a concrete approach to purchase him this summer.\n\nThe report further claims that Inter are currently in talks with the fullback to extend his deal, but if they can't reach an agreement over the coming weeks then they could cash-in on him for a fee of around \u00a321m.\n\nDumfries to Man Utd\n\nGazzetta dello Sport also states that Dumfries 'would like' to move to Old Trafford and Erik ten Hag, whose future is uncertain at the Red Devils following a disappointing campaign this term, would be willing to sign his compatriot if he remains as United manager next season.\n\nDumfries, standing at 6ft 2in tall, is quick, strong, good in the air, comfortable playing out from the back and also efficient in defensive contributions. So, he could be a shrewd signing for Man Utd if they purchase him.\n\nHowever, although the Inter star has showcased glimpses of his qualities at the Italian top-flight, he has found it difficult to play regularly at Inter this season so there is a question mark whether he would be the right option for Man Utd to reinforce their backline.\n\nNevertheless, it is going to be interesting to see whether the record Premier League champions eventually opt to make a concrete approach to secure the Netherlands international's signature if he moves away from Giuseppe Meazza Stadium in the upcoming transfer window.\n\nRelated TopicsDenzel DumfriesManchester UnitedPremier LeagueTransfer Rumours Home \" Manchester United \" Man Utd Transfer News \" Man Utd interested in signing Denzel Dumfries this summer", "source": {"uri": "football-talk.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football Talk | Premier League News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jit@football-talk.co.uk", "name": "Jit", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Gazzetta_dello_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "La Gazzetta dello Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Garnacho", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Garnacho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Wan-Bissaka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Wan-Bissaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Dumfries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Dumfries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumfries", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dumfries"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dumfries"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Siro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Siro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football League First Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://football-talk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fc-internazionale-v-torino-fc-serie-a-scaled-e1654867893760.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543379", "eventUri": "eng-9543379", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

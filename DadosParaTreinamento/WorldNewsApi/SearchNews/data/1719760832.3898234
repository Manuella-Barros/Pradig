Although fans of the daytime TV icon were saddened by the news of her shock split from Eamonn Holmes, Ruth's pals are reportedly looking forward to seeing her let her hair down as temperatures rise. Ruth and Eamonn's 27-year relationship broke down after work commitments took their lives 'in different directions', according to a source close to the couple. Before the split, Ruth opened up about the 'testing time' she was experiencing with Eamonn as the Irish GB news presenter has been grappling with chronic health problems. She was also reportedly unable to move past her husband's outspoken rants against their former employer, ITV, when the duo were axed from This Morning. With a new chapter opening up in front of her, it's hoped Ruth will be in for a fun summer ahead, with one celebrity pal on hand for nights out clubbing in Ibiza. Fellow This Morning presenter Rylan Clark has previously spoken of how supportive Eamonn and Ruth were during his struggles with depression, sharing how the couple had 'driven two hours' to check in on him following a concerned call from his mum. Opening up during an appearance on the High Performance podcast back in January, Rylan, 35, recalled how their presence 'reminded [him]' that there was life outside the front door', and that he had been 'someone before all of this s***.\" It's now believed that Rylan will be keen to help Ruth in turn, as she navigates single life once more after 14 years of marriage. A source told OK!: \"Rylan was close to both Ruth and Eamonn and owes them both a lot so he doesn't want to take sides. But he and Ruth have always got on and love a party so Rylan has promised to take Ruth away this summer and make her go wild. \"She's had a tough few years because of looking after Eamonn and also caring for her mum so he feels she deserves it \u2013 he's desperate for Ruth to take Ruth clubbing in Ibiza!\" The source also claimed: \"Although this split happened a while ago, Ruth feels shattered as she's had to put a brave face on for so long. It's been a really tough time for her as her whole life has now changed. She no longer has Eamonn and their son Jack is all grown up living his life - she feels a little lost. But she's got a very strong group of friends who have all been there for her and will support her - with the main person being Rylan.\" If you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

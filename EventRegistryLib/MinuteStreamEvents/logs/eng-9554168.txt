For peace, for gender equality, for human rights and for the SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals],\" said Ms. Mohammed, said, adding: \"You stand in solidarity with the vulnerable and the marginalized.\"\n\n\"This Conference is a testament to the strong voice of civil society, despite rising threats and shrinking space.\"\n\nMs. Mohammed went on to explain the Conference reaffirmed that the upcoming Summit of the Future must resonate with civil societies priorities, concerns and expectations. September's Summit was a generational opportunity to update international institutions and build a more inclusive multilateralism that served the interests of all peoples.\n\nOrganized by the UN Department of Global Communications, the Civil Society Conference will run for two days over May 9 and 10 at the UN Office at Nairobi (UNON).\n\n'We need you, civil society'\n\nOpening the event, Maher Nasser, Director of the UN communication department's Outreach Division, said that more than 3,600 civil society representatives from 2,750 entities had registered for the Conference, along with around 400 representatives of 64 governments, seven inter-governmental organizations (IGOs), 37 UN entities and over 100 media reporters.\n\nIn addition, 70 per cent of those registered were from Africa and 40 per cent of all registrations were youth, in the age group 18 to 34. Climate was the top issue for youth registrants. Before handing over to the Co-Chairs, Mr. Nasser implored the audience to remember that \"today is yesterday's tomorrow and last year's future.\"\n\nDennis Francis, President of the UN General Assembly, speaking via video message, said: \"For the Summit to serve as a catalyst for impactful global action, we need robust collaboration and buy-in from those directly affected to drive its action-oriented outcomes.\"\n\nReferring to the documents that are expected to emerge from the Summit - the Pact for the Future, the Global Digital Compact and the Declaration on Future Generations - the Assembly President said, \"we need you, civil society, to play a critical role in this process.\"\n\nGuy Ryder, UN Under-Secretary-General for Policy, said the next two days were a vital step in the journey towards the Summit of the Future. The insights, commitment, and call for action were indispensable to the processes that lay ahead.\n\n\"We are all acutely aware that we need to work together, if we were to have any chance of meeting today's global challenges; ongoing conflicts, escalating geopolitical tensions; multiplying humanitarian crisis; rising inequalities...the climate emergency and so much more,\" he stated.\n\nMoreover, cooperation and solidarity were needed at all levels.\n\n\"And for that, we need systems, institutions, mindsets that are up to the task and reflect contemporary realities,\" Mr. Ryder said, urging everyone, especially young people, to get involved and encouraged everyone to ramp up engagement with their governments in the lead up to September.\n\n'We want real change'\n\nA highlight of the opening session was a keynote address from Karimot Odebode, SDG Young Leader, one of the 17 young leaders for the Sustainable Development Goals, who leads a civil society organization in Nigeria.\n\nShe read a poem entitled The Journey Ahead.\n\n\"My generation is tired,\" she said, stressing, \"we want real change. Are you ready to commit to peace? Are you ready? Because I commit.

Civil society leaders had a unique responsibility in shaping the future of global and sustainable progress, she stressed.\n\nFlorence Syevuo, another SDG Young Leader, said the Conference was a call from civil society to address global inequality once and for all, particularly those between the Global North and South. Some 70 per cent of the participants hailed from Africa, which was important; those left out of the 'New York bubble' could not meaningfully engage in conversations on sustainable development.\n\n\"No future UN civil society conference should be held where the UN only sits for administrative purposes...we are hoping we can go to many Global South countries,\" Ms. Syevuo said.\n\n'Raise the bar on multilateralism'\n\nCarole Agengo, co-chair of the Planning Committee of the 2024 Civil Society Conference and Africa Regional Representative at HelpAge International, said civil society in the Global South faced challenges in accessing previous conferences for various reasons, mostly due to visas.\n\nReflecting on this, the current Conference had set a premium on inclusion and participation. Ms. Agengo said it was vital for organizations in the Global South to unleash the power in their numbers and collaborate, as they moved forward towards the Summit of the Future.\n\nFor her part, Nudhara Yusuf, Co-Chair of the Planning Committee of the 2024 Civil Society Conference, Global Governance Innovation Network and Youth Coordinator, Coalition for the UN We Need, said the Conference aimed to meaningfully support the Summit of the Future, which would be held at a critical moment.\n\nDuring that Summit, civil society would ask UN Member States to raise the bar on multilateralism. In turn, civil society needed to be willing to push the envelope on how they engaged with multilateral and intergovernmental processes, he said.\n\nThe work of the Conference\n\nThe Conference on Thursday also featured 37 on-site workshops, co-organized by stakeholders, including civil society and United Nations entities and attended by various participants including UN Member States.\n\nThis was followed with the discussion on civil society recommendations on the Pact for the Future, Declaration on Future Generations, and Global Digital Compact and an interactive dialogue on those proposed outcomes and related issues.\n\nFriday is expected to kick off with an interactive dialogue, Looking ahead to the Summit and Beyond and a panel discussion, with responses from UN agencies, philanthropic groups and UN Member States.\n\nThe closing session will take place in the afternoon and will be attended by UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and the President of Kenya, William Ruto.", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amina_J._Mohammed", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amina J.

The closing session will take place in the afternoon and will be attended by UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and the President of Kenya, William Ruto.", "source": {"uri": "news.un.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "UN News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amina_J._Mohammed", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amina J.

Maher Nasser, Chair of the Conference, along with Co-Chairs of the planning committee Carole Ageng'o and Nudhara Yusuf share their commitments for the UN Civil Society Conference. #WeCommit\n\nMaher Nasser, Director of Outreach in the United Nations Department of Global Communications\n\n\"The Department of Global Communications is very proud to be part of the planning and organizing of the 2024 UN Civil Society Conference in Nairobi, the 69 since the Department's creation and one that is receiving immense interest from civil society and other stakeholders, including from government representatives. This is the first of our civil society conferences to be held Africa and we are very grateful to the Government and civil society organizations in Kenya who have welcomed us with open arms and to our colleagues at the UN Office in Nairobi who will be hosting us in their beautiful campus sandwiched between Gigiri district and Karura Forest. As Co-Chair of the Planning Committee, my focus, and that of my colleagues in the Department, is to ensure the success of the Conference under the able leadership of Co-Chairs Carole Ageng'o and Nudhara Yusuf who are supported by a diverse and impressive civil society representatives from all around the world. The Conference comes at a critical point in the preparations for the Summit of the Future, a Summit that is billed as a major step towards a more inclusive and networked multilateralism providing multilateral solutions for a better tomorrow.\"\n\nCarole Ageng'o,Global Initiatives Lead & Africa Regional Representative at HelpAge International\n\n\"That civil society engagement remains a critical cog in the wheel of development, is well established. Greater collaboration between civil society organizations, governments and private sector can therefore not be more urgent at this time as we gear up for the Summit of the Future. I look forward to a fruitful and effective partnership with my Co-Chair Nudhara Yusuf in putting together, and delivering (producing) a successful UNSSC to fully anchor civil society participation in the subsequent processes leading up to and including the Summit of the Future. Indeed, civil society participation will contribute greatly towards meeting the aspiration of \"an international system - that is better prepared to manage the challenges we face now and, in the future, for the sake of all humanity and for future generations.\"\n\n\"The Summit of the Future, above all, is a call to rethink the way things have always been done. I believe, along with my Co-Chair Carole, and many other civil society leaders, that Nairobi could and should be a moment for civil society to show, not just call for, process innovation; how civil society engages with intergovernmental processes. Come May 2024, we should have a clearer picture of what a Pact for the Future is likely to constitute, while the Nairobi moment would look to meaningfully feed civil society perspectives into the process, we hope it will also be a place to start the critical multistakeholder conversation about how to land the Pact for the Future. We hope we can capitalize on the multistakeholder and intergenerational convening to build ImPACT Coalitions of Member States, civil society, and UN and other entities, who will help take forth key issue areas and reforms. We hope the Nairobi moment will be a civil society hosted space to move the international community from language to an action oriented networked and inclusive multilateralism.\"", "source": {"uri": "un.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "United Nations"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maher_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maher Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Department_of_Global_Communications", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Department of Global Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigiri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gigiri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gigiri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karura_Forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karura Forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation_Authorities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation Authorities", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Organizations", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Organizations", "wgt": 23}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554168", "eventUri": "eng-9554168", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Greater collaboration between civil society organizations, governments, and the private sector can therefore not be more urgent at this time as we gear up for the Summit of the Future,\" says Carole Ageng'o, Global Initiatives Lead & Africa Regional Representative at HelpAge International.\n\n\"Indeed, civil society participation will contribute greatly towards meeting the aspiration of an international system that is better prepared to manage the challenges we face now and, in the future, for the sake of all humanity and for future generations.\"\n\nSince 1947, sixty-eight civil society conferences have resulted in successful outcomes due to previous interactions with civil society organizations. The ongoing conference is the premier event on the civil society calendar at the United Nations and the first of the UN's civil society conferences to be held in Africa.\n\nBorn in Zimbabwe and currently working in South Africa as a human rights defender, Constance Mukarati told IPS that the role of civil society organizations and, more so, human rights defenders cannot be overstated towards ensuring that no one is left behind.\n\n\"For us, SDG 5 is really SDG 1. As a matter of urgency, women and girls everywhere must have equal rights and opportunities. We are still in an era where girl child education is not a priority and a gathering such as this is an opportunity for a revolution in how we think about issues of national and global concern, how we talk about these issues, who is in the room and how we execute and implement commitments towards sustainable development,\" says Mukarati from the African Initiative of Women Human Rights Defenders.\n\nThe ongoing gathering of civil society and other stakeholders is on track to provide preliminary discussions and data ahead of the world's leaders' Summit of the Future on September 22-23, 2024, at the UN Headquarters in New York. The Summit is part of a monumental effort to reset global cooperation towards accelerating efforts to meet our existing international commitments and take concrete steps to respond to emerging challenges and opportunities.\n\nUltimately, the Summit of the Future is about rethinking what multilateralism means in a world characterized by plummeting levels of trust in public institutions, glaring wealth inequalities, and a majority of the world's population in underdeveloped and developing nations being left furthest behind, falling deeper into extreme hunger and poverty. To address global concerns, the Summit will produce three international frameworks: the Pact for the Future (available as a zero draft), the Global Digital Compact, and the Declaration on Future Generations.\n\n\"It is highly urgent that the UN systems relook and redesign how they engage its global citizenry so that the citizens can in turn engage the UN more effectively. This is what is needed to bring the SDGs back on track. What are people saying about the multiple challenges they face today? There is a feeling within the civil society movement that governments' voices are prioritized within the UN system. This engagement is unique and highly relevant for our voices as activists and human rights defenders, which will inform and influence the direction that the Summit of the Future takes,\" Eric Omondi, a Nairobi-based activist, told IPS.\n\nThis is a historic gathering aimed at galvanizing collaboration and reinforcing civil society organizations engagement in sustainable development. \"We recognize that our generation stands at a critical junction where every action we take can significantly shape the future of our shared planet,\" said Florence Syevuo, Executive Director, SDG Kenya Forum, and Co-Chair, Coalition for the UN We Need, Nairobi.\n\nShe stressed that the need to recognize the urgency of addressing global concerns such as climate change has never been more tangible as the effects of human interactions with nature become even more evident, underpinning why the outcome of the conference matters to all.\n\nThe Civil Society Conference and the Summit of the Future are critical platforms for deepening the engagement of citizens in international cooperation. As a prelude to the Summit of the Future, the Civil Society Conference features in-depth dialogues, a variety of workshops, and exhibits centered on three main objectives: inclusivity, impact, and innovation.\n\nInclusivity helps broaden the scope of discourse on global issues by enhancing the visibility and impact of diverse voices. On impact, participants are shaping global multi-stakeholder coalitions to advocate for and push the key issues that will be the outcome of the September Summit of the Future. On innovation, the two-day gathering is redefining the interaction between civil society and intergovernmental processes, showcasing a new model of collaboration that spans generations and sectors.\n\n\"The inclusion of youths and young voices in the SDG processes and other related commitments must become a priority. I recently completed my studies in law at Kampala International University and I intend to use my legal knowledge to amplify the most pressing problems facing young people in the global south and the communities in which they live,\" Kiconco Shallom Esther, a youth participant from Uganda, told IPS.\n\nAs the curtain fell on the first day of the landmark civil society conference, there was consensus around the need to promote civil society's insights and initiatives to bolster the Member State-led Summit of the Future process. Further emphasizing that a reinvigorated, organized civil society group can more effectively hold governments and powers accountable for progress towards a just, fair, and equitable shared future.",

Bringing together more than 2,000 participants from civil society organizations, academic institutions, think tanks, member states, private sector companies, UN entities, change-makers, and other relevant stakeholders from across the globe.\n\n\"That civil society engagement remains a critical cog in the wheel of development is well established. Greater collaboration between civil society organizations, governments, and the private sector can therefore not be more urgent at this time as we gear up for the Summit of the Future,\" says Carole Ageng'o, Global Initiatives Lead & Africa Regional Representative at HelpAge International.\n\n\"Indeed, civil society participation will contribute greatly towards meeting the aspiration of an international system that is better prepared to manage the challenges we face now and, in the future, for the sake of all humanity and for future generations.\"\n\nSince 1947, sixty-eight civil society conferences have resulted in successful outcomes due to previous interactions with civil society organizations. The ongoing conference is the premier event on the civil society calendar at the United Nations and the first of the UN's civil society conferences to be held in Africa.\n\nBorn in Zimbabwe and currently working in South Africa as a human rights defender, Constance Mukarati told IPS that the role of civil society organizations and, more so, human rights defenders cannot be overstated towards ensuring that no one is left behind.\n\n\"For us, SDG 5 is really SDG 1. As a matter of urgency, women and girls everywhere must have equal rights and opportunities. We are still in an era where girl child education is not a priority and a gathering such as this is an opportunity for a revolution in how we think about issues of national and global concern, how we talk about these issues, who is in the room and how we execute and implement commitments towards sustainable development,\" says Mukarati from the African Initiative of Women Human Rights Defenders.\n\nThe ongoing gathering of civil society and other stakeholders is on track to provide preliminary discussions and data ahead of the world's leaders' Summit of the Future on September 22-23, 2024, at the UN Headquarters in New York. The Summit is part of a monumental effort to reset global cooperation towards accelerating efforts to meet our existing international commitments and take concrete steps to respond to emerging challenges and opportunities.\n\nUltimately, the Summit of the Future is about rethinking what multilateralism means in a world characterized by plummeting levels of trust in public institutions, glaring wealth inequalities, and a majority of the world's population in underdeveloped and developing nations being left furthest behind, falling deeper into extreme hunger and poverty. To address global concerns, the Summit will produce three international frameworks: the Pact for the Future (available as a zero draft), the Global Digital Compact, and the Declaration on Future Generations.\n\n\"It is highly urgent that the UN systems relook and redesign how they engage its global citizenry so that the citizens can in turn engage the UN more effectively. This is what is needed to bring the SDGs back on track. What are people saying about the multiple challenges they face today? There is a feeling within the civil society movement that governments' voices are prioritized within the UN system. This engagement is unique and highly relevant for our voices as activists and human rights defenders, which will inform and influence the direction that the Summit of the Future takes,\" Eric Omondi, a Nairobi-based activist, told IPS.\n\nThis is a historic gathering aimed at galvanizing collaboration and reinforcing civil society organizations engagement in sustainable development. \"We recognize that our generation stands at a critical junction where every action we take can significantly shape the future of our shared planet,\" said Florence Syevuo, Executive Director, SDG Kenya Forum, and Co-Chair, Coalition for the UN We Need, Nairobi.\n\nShe stressed that the need to recognize the urgency of addressing global concerns such as climate change has never been more tangible as the effects of human interactions with nature become even more evident, underpinning why the outcome of the conference matters to all.\n\nThe Civil Society Conference and the Summit of the Future are critical platforms for deepening the engagement of citizens in international cooperation. As a prelude to the Summit of the Future, the Civil Society Conference features in-depth dialogues, a variety of workshops, and exhibits centered on three main objectives: inclusivity, impact, and innovation.\n\nInclusivity helps broaden the scope of discourse on global issues by enhancing the visibility and impact of diverse voices. On impact, participants are shaping global multi-stakeholder coalitions to advocate for and push the key issues that will be the outcome of the September Summit of the Future. On innovation, the two-day gathering is redefining the interaction between civil society and intergovernmental processes, showcasing a new model of collaboration that spans generations and sectors.\n\n\"The inclusion of youths and young voices in the SDG processes and other related commitments must become a priority. I recently completed my studies in law at Kampala International University and I intend to use my legal knowledge to amplify the most pressing problems facing young people in the global south and the communities in which they live,\" Kiconco Shallom Esther, a youth participant from Uganda, told IPS.\n\nAs the curtain fell on the first day of the landmark civil society conference, there was consensus around the need to promote civil society's insights and initiatives to bolster the Member State-led Summit of the Future process. Further emphasizing that a reinvigorated, organized civil society group can more effectively hold governments and powers accountable for progress towards a just, fair, and equitable shared future.",

Various shots, participants at the conference\n\nBringing together representatives of civil society, government representatives, senior United Nations officials, youth changemakers, academia, other stakeholders and media, the United Nations Civil Society Conference is the premier event on the civil society calendar at the United Nations, ahead of the Summit of the Future.\n\nOrganized by the United Nations Department of Global Communications, the Conference will run for two days over May 9 and 10 at the United Nations Office at Nairobi. It has attracted strong interest, with over 3000 expected to attend, representing mainly civil society representatives, governments, United Nations entities, international governmental organizations and other stakeholders.\n\nIn opening remarks, Maher Nasser, Co-Chair of the Planning Committee of the 2024 Civil Society Conference, Director, Outreach Division, United Nations Department of Global Communications and Master of Ceremonies, said last week's heavy rains and flooding had left death and havoc across Kenya and neighboring countries; extreme weather conditions once again demonstrated that the impact of climate change was harming those least responsible for creating the climate crisis. Mr. Nasser extended deep condolences to the victims, and solidarity with the impacted communities. The Department of Global Communications had never organized a conference of this size, which had attracted such a high level of interest, in such a short period of time. Over 3,600 civil society representatives from 2,750 entities had registered, along with around 400 representatives of 64 governments, seven International Governmental Organizations (IGOs), 37 United Nations entities and over 100 media reporters. 70 percent of those registered were from Africa and 40 percent of all registrations were youth, in the age group 18 to 34. Mr. Nasser hoped the expectations from the Conference would be achieved.\n\nZainab Hawa Bangura, Director-General of the United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON), warmly welcomed everyone to the environmentally friendly UNON complex where the greening the blue initiative had come to life. In the context of the heavy floods which had ravaged Kenya, Ms. Bangura extended the Secretary General's message of support and condolences to those affected. The UN and their partners were working closely to address humanitarian needs. UNON was the only UN headquarters in the global south, and was honored to host the 69th Civil Society Conference in Nairobi, which was the first time it had been held in Africa. The Conference provided a unique opportunity for civil society and multi-stakeholder engagement; it was a vital prelude to the world leader's summit of the future.\n\nCivil society played a fundamental role in shaping a future, which today more than ever, needed multilateral approaches. As a former civil society leader, Ms. Bangura understood the vital role civil society played around the world. She encouraged all delegations to make their voice heard. UNON remained a key partner supporting UN operations globally and was a trailblazer in sustainable work. UNON was undergoing a historical transformation that would boost the journey towards energy, neutrality and bio-diversity. Two key capital construction projects, including the construction of six new office blocks, and the upgrade of conferences facilities with a combined value of 340 million dollars, represented the most significant UN infrastructure project in Africa. In closing, Ms. Bangura thanked member states and acknowledged the Kenyan government's continued collaboration towards infrastructure developments.\n\nMr. Nasser thanked the Director General for welcoming the idea of the Conference in Nairobi, when he had first proposed the idea in April 2023. He also thanked the European Union, the Government of Denmark, the Ford Foundation and the United Nations Foundation for their financial support, the United Nations Office at Nairobi and the other United Nations entities for hosting the Conference, and the civil society partners who had worked with the team as part of the planning process. Mr. Nasser also acknowledged the presence of the co-facilitators of the Pact for the Future, the Global Digital Compact and the Declaration on Future Generations, the Office of the President of the General Assembly and the Our Common Agenda team, and other senior leaders from across the United Nations system.\n\nOver 80 percent of Conference registrants reported working with vulnerable groups. Over 60 percent of registrants identified as Human Rights Defenders. Climate was the top issue for youth registrants. Those over 35 years old identified gender as the top issue. The third most identified topic of interest was youth and children. It was important to remember that today was yesterday's tomorrow and last year's future. Mr. Nasser asked; what lessons could be learned from not paying attention to issues which had come to haunt us? Carbon and greenhouse gas emissions; climate change. Income inequalities and persistent gender inequalities, selective application of the rule of law and the resulting erosion of the universality of these concepts. Civil Society was the embodiment of the opening words of the Charter of the United Nations, \"We the Peoples of the United Nations\". It was important that civil society did not waver in their advocacy and actions to hold everyone in power accountable. In keeping with tradition, Mr. Nasser concluded and handed over to the Co-Chairs to deliver their opening remarks.\n\nCAROLE AGENGO, Co-Chair of the Planning Committee of the 2024 Civil Society Conference, Global Initiatives Lead &amp; Africa Regional Representative at HelpAge International, welcomed all Conference participants to Nairobi, and expressed her solidarity with those affected by the devastating floods. The UN Civil society conference had made its first stop in the global south. While this was positive, the reality represented the underlying inequality and lack of inclusion. Civil society in the Global South had faced challenges in accessing previous conferences for various reasons, most predominantly, due to visas. Reflecting on this, the Conference had established a premium on inclusion and participation. Ten diverse subcommittees had been established, which further conceptualized the inclusivity in the objectives to level up inclusion, impact, and innovation. Today and tomorrow, there would be inclusive workshops, covering a broad range of issues and themes, organized by organizations from across the globe. Yesterday, a successful youth activation local mobilization day had been held, where 400 people from across the country had participated. In closing, Ms. Agengo reflected on two African proverbs: \"it was only by the strength in their numbers that the ants in the field can carry their prey to the rest; and \"when hunger strikes a country, no one is spared.\" With these in mind, it was vital for organizations in the Global South to unleash the power in their numbers and collaborate, as they moved forward towards the Summit of the Future.\n\nNudhara Yusuf, Co-Chair of the Planning Committee of the 2024 Civil Society Conference, Global Governance Innovation Network (GGIN), Executive Coordinator at Stimson Center, Youth Coordinator, Coalition for the UN We Need, said she stood in solidarity with those in Kenya who had suffered from recent flooding, and was reminded every day that the lowest hanging fruit from Conesus was the need for change. Ms. Yusuf quoted a saying in Damu, which meant \"every country is the people's country, and every people are our peoples\", and expressed gratitude to those who had organized the Conference. The meeting aimed to meaningfully support the Summit of the Future, which was a critical moment. In the Summit, civil society would ask member states to raise the bar on multilateralism. In turn, civil society needed to be willing to push the envelope on how they engaged with multilateral and intergovernmental processes. This notion was present in every ounce of the organized chaotic glory which was about to unfold. The Conference would host 20 impact coalitions, 50 exhibits, an intergenerational hub, a media zone and much more. Ms. Yusuf concluded by wishing everyone an enjoyable Conference. She hoped this was the start of the story of what happened next; a story of inclusion, innovation and impact.\n\nAmina Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General, Executive Office of the Secretary-General (EOSG), speaking via video message, expressed her deep condolences to the victims of the devasting floods in Kenya, reiterating the United Nation's continued commitment to supporting the Government of Kenya during this challenging time. Ms. Mohammed also reiterated the Secretary-General's call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages and safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid. 'We the Peoples', the powerful opening of the United Nations Charter, was a commitment to come together for the benefit of all peoples. Every day, civil society groups around the world worked tirelessly to advance the goals of the United Nations, through their fight for global, social and climate justice, and for peace, gender equality and human rights. The Conference was a testament to the strong voice of civil society, despite rising threats and shrinking space. It also reaffirmed that the upcoming Summit of the Future needed to resonate with their priorities, their concerns, and their expectations. September's Summit was a generational opportunity to update international institutions and build a more inclusive multilateralism that served the interests of all peoples. But that opportunity could only be seized with active engagement. Between now and September, civil society's views and active participation were needed. Ms. Mohammed urged civil society fully engage with Member States and Leaders in New York and in capitals; to join forces with civil society colleagues across regions and causes; to connect the changes needed in multilateralism with the changes people needed to see in their daily lives; and to make their voices count.\n\nKARIMOT ODEBODE, SDG Young Leader, said she was one of the 17 young leaders for the Sustainable Development Goals and a young person leading a civil society organization in Nigeria. Today at the Conference, civil society gathered as a matter of urgency, to develop a road map towards a sustainable future. Civil society leaders had a unique responsibility in shaping the future of global and sustainable progress. The world was faced with urgent humanitarian crisis'; from girls being denied education in Afghanistan, to civil unrest in Sudan, to genocide in Palestine and to an urgent climate crisis in Kenya, Somalia and Yemen. Was the world truly on a pathway towards shaping a sustainable future? It was seven years until the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development. This was a reality which required commitment, concrete action and tangible results. Moving towards the Summit of the Future, Mr. Odebode called on all actors to work alongside civil society across the world. This required a multilateral approach and for organizations and governments to come together with civil society, to create multilateral solutions for today and a better tomorrow. No one was equal, until everyone was equal. No country was at peace. if any country was not at peace.\n\nMs. Odebode then read a poem entitled \"the Journey Ahead\". \"Today, We come together as one. Irrespective of gender, age. Country and religion. We come as a coalition of people, Who wants a future that is worth leaving for generations to come... Today, We come as one. To shape the future that is sustainable. A future free of violence, hunger and climate crises...The journey ahead is not a walk in the park. It is not just grand promises. It is action and collaboration. Like my people would say...A single stick of broom can never sweep a room clean... My generation is tired. We want real change. Are you ready to commit to peace?\"\n\nGuy Ryder, Under-Secretary-General for Policy, said it was a privilege to be in Nairobi at the Conference and witness the power of activism and partnership evident in the room. Mr. Ryder expressed sympathy and support to the people of Kenya in the wake of the flooding which had struck the country. He thanked the leadership of the Conference and the organizing committee for making the Conference possible, and every civil society representative and organization who was in attendance. The next two days were a vital step in the journey towards the Summit of the Future. The insights, commitment, and call for action were indispensable to the processes that lay ahead. Everyone needed to work together to meet today's global challenges; ongoing conflicts, geopolitical tensions; multiplying humanitarian crisis; the climate emergency and much more. There needed to be cooperation and solidarity at all levels. For that there needed to be systems and institutions that were up to the tasks and reflected contemporary realities, to deliver on the 2030 Agenda.\n\nToday's world demanded more effective and inclusive multilateralism. The Summit of the Future in September was the opportunity to shape just that. The path from the Conference to the Summit offered opportunity to build new forms of cooperation between the United Nations, member states and its people. At the Summit itself, world leaders would come together to force an international consensus and agree on a Pact for the Future. The work and discussions during the Conference around the Pact would continue to form international processes and show how multilateralism could impact people's lives across the world. Between now and September, it was important to work together, particularly through Impact Coalitions and the Summit of the Future Action days. These would be organized around the themes of digital and technology, peace and security, and sustainable development and financing, with a particular emphasis on youth leadership. Mr. Ryder urged everyone, especially young people to get involved and encouraged everyone to ramp up engagement with their governments in the lead up to September. Governments needed their inputs and guidance to achieve meaningful results at the Summit. The UN system stood ready to provide support.\n\nDennis Francis, President of the 78th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, speaking via video message, regretted that he was not able to attend in person, but reiterated his keen interest in the Conference's agenda and its outcome. This important gathering was poised to shape the highly anticipated Summit of the Future in September. The Summit provided a pivotal moment to drive transformative action that would mobilize and scale up support for accelerated progress towards the completion of the Sustainable Development Goals and other related commitments. Civil society organizations, youth changemakers, academia, public opinion-makers, and media were indispensable in mobilizing affected communities on the ground, advocating for solidarity and accountability, and driving inclusive progress. At a time when the multilateral system and international cooperation faced major obstacles, the significance of the Summit of the Future as a critical juncture, could not be underestimated.\n\nHowever, such an undertaking could not be fulfilled by Member States alone. For the Summit to serve as a catalyst for impactful global action, there needed to be robust collaboration and buy-in from those directly affected to drive its action-oriented outcomes. In this regard, the Pact for the Future, the Global Digital Compact and the Declaration on Future Generations, and civil society needed to play a critical role in this process. The journey needed to continue past the convening of the Summit itself and into the crucial implementation phase, which would require sustained collaboration among all stakeholders. Mr. Francis concluded by inviting civil society to be thorough in their reflections, as steadfast advocates for the multilateral system. He called on everyone to direct efforts towards achieving transformative change, to craft an indelible legacy of peace, progress, prosperity and sustainability for the present and future generations.\n\nFlorence Syevuo, SDG Young Leader, welcomed everyone to Kenya and thanked them for attending the Conference. She called for a moment of silene to acknowledge the lives of those lost in Kenya due to the heavy rains. The world was at a critical juncture, where every action could shape the trajectory of the shared planet. The urgency to address climate change had never been more tangible, particular as Kenya and many others grappled with flooding, underscoring imperative actions and resilience building measures. These were the effects of human interaction with the planet, and a reminder of why the outcome of the Conference mattered to everyone. At the midway mark towards achieving the SDGs, it was imperative to reflect on collective efforts made towards commitments to global targets. While significant strides had been made, there was still much ground to cover. The challenges faced were multi-faceted and complex and required a unified approach from all stakeholders. Civil society were calling for continued engagement within the multi-stakeholder approach. Today marked a significant day, to ensure this approach was being realized in Kenya for the very first time. The Nairobi Summit would lead to a number of impacts coalitions that would organise civil society vehicles to support Pact cooperation. The Summit was a once in a generation opportunity to strengthen this system.\n\nCivil society needed to ask whether the commitments depicted in the proposed Pact for the Future and associated outcome documents, were commensurate with the challenges faced in achieving the sustainable development goals. The proposed language in the Draft for the Future was welcome, and it was promising that so many foundations, government and United Nations agencies had prioritized attendance to the conference. The Conference was a call from civil society to address global inequality once and for all, particularly those between the Global North and South. 70 percent of participants were from Africa which was important; those left out of the New York bubble could not meaningfully engage in conversations on sustainable development. It was hoped the Conference would inspire collective spirits for joint meaningful action to create equal opportunities for all of humanity. The Conference should be landmark for solving the persistent challenges in the generation. Yesterday, protesters had been arrested in Nairobi had been arrested. Ms. Syevuo called for their immediate release; picketing was not crime. No future UN Civil Society conference should be held where the United Nations only sat for administrative purposes. It was hoped future conference would be held in many countries of the Global South.\n\nIn closing remarks, Ms. Agengo, thanked everyone who had attended the opening session and those who had spoken. She reiterated that \"we the people\" Nairobi was a stepping-stone into the future, where we would lift up collaboration.\n\nMs. YUSUF, said there were an exciting two days ahead and the best was yet to come. She explained the logistics for the workshops which would be held throughout the Conference, and for the afternoon plenary session.

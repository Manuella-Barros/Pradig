Charcoal barbecues, fireworks and exploding targets are also prohibited.\n\n\"It is crucial that Albertans avoid any activities that fall under this ban to prevent new wildfires from breaking out,\" the province said in the bulletin.\n\nCities, towns, villages, summer villages and federal lands such as national parks are exempt from the ban. They have the authority to issue their own bans and may have them in place already, the province said in an online bulletin.\n\nAppliances powered by propane or natural gas are not banned. Wood fires inside structures such as a building, tent or recreational vehicle are permitted, as long as they have a chimney and spark arrestor.\n\nHot and dry conditions have led to 137 new wildfire starts since July 1, the government said.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, an evacuation order was issued for people in Garden River, Alta., located about 800 kilometres north of Edmonton in Wood Buffalo National Park.\n\nAlberta Wildfire said the community are not in immediate danger, but there are concerns a wildfire burning about 30 kilometres away could cut off access to Highway 58, the only road into the community of about 700 people,\n\n\"If the fire continues on its current pathway, we don't want anyone getting trapped in Garden River due to lack of access to the highway, because that will be closed,\" Conroy Sewepagaham, chief of Little Red River Cree Nation, said in a video address published on Facebook on Wednesday.\n\nResidents are told to be prepared to be away for multiple days and to bring medications and important documents. They have been urged to go to the Horizon Camp on the First Nations settlement of John D'Or Prairie.\n\nSewepagaham said the fire could threaten transmission lines, resulting in power outages in the communities of Garden River and Fox Lake.\n\nFire HWF061 is one of several out-of-control blazes in the Semo Wildfire Complex in northwestern Alberta.\n\nAlberta Wildfire said Wednesday that it has been growing as a result of the \"significant heat wave over the last few days\" and noted rising temperatures will play a big factor in its continuing spread.\n\nA ridge of high pressure brought record-breaking temperatures to some parts of Western Canada Tuesday.\n\nA new record of 35.8 C was set in the Jasper area, eclipsing the previous high temperature of 34.4 set in 1926. At least 13 areas of the province broke historical records, Environment Canada said Wednesday.\n\nTemperatures in the Edmonton area reached 34.1 C, tying the previous record set in 2015.\n\nOvernight lows ranging from the mid-teens into the low 20s will not provide much relief from the daytime heat, the weather agency said.\n\nAlbertans trying to stay cool also helped break an energy consumption record set in 2021.\n\nThe Alberta Electric System Operator, the province's power grid operator, said a new all-time summer peak record of 11,820 megawatts was set Tuesday. The previous summer record was 11,721 MW, set on June 29, 2021.\n\nCooler temperatures will begin to move into northwestern regions of the province on Thursday, while parts of central and southern Alberta will moderate on Friday.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nFirefighters in the north are battling several out-of-control fires. The largest of these is HWF061, which has grown to almost 40,000 hectares and forced the Wednesday evacuation order for Garden City.\n\nFurther east, the largest blaze in the Cattail Lake Complex wildfire, about 70 kilometres northeast of Fort McMurray, grew significantly overnight and is now estimated to be about 28,000 hectares in size.\n\nThat fire has remained eight kilometres from Suncor's Firebag oilsands facility.

The previous summer record was 11,721 MW, set on June 29, 2021.\n\nCooler temperatures will begin to move into northwestern regions of the province on Thursday, while parts of central and southern Alberta will moderate on Friday.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nThe extreme heat conditions have seen varying levels of fire safety regulations, including full fire bans, enacted across the province. A fire restriction is in place for most of the province's north as firefighters battle several out-of-control fires.\n\nThe largest of these is HWF061, which has grown to almost 40,000 hectares and forced the Wednesday evacuation order for Garden City.\n\nFurther east, the largest blaze in the Cattail Lake Complex wildfire, about 70 kilometres northeast of Fort McMurray, grew significantly overnight and is now estimated to be about 28,000 hectares in size.\n\nThat fire has remained eight kilometres from Suncor's Firebag oilsands facility.

With the humidex, it will feel even warmer than that throughout the region.\n\nThese kinds of temperatures create significant health risks to vulnerable people especially as the ambient temperatures exceed what is considered to be a normal body temperature. It is imperative to find ways to cool down and stay hydrated - check in on neightbours and ensure animals are also following the same protocols as humans require.\n\nThis ridge is slow-moving as the clockwise-circulating high pressure system in the ridge remains anchored by counter-clockwise rotating low pressure systems east and west of it.\n\nA frontal system is expected to dislodge it late Wednesday and potentially produce some severe thunderstorms - a less than ideal scenario for a region that is already very hot and dry.\n\nThis period of unusually warm weather has amplified the risk for wildfires - leaving most of Alberta under a high to extreme rating on the Fire Danger Relative Index (an assessment that considers 1. How easily a wildfire could start, 2. How difficult it would be to extinguish said wildfire, and 3. How much damage a wildfire could do).\n\nWildfire smoke from active fires also prompted some air quality advisories as particulate is sitting over northern Alberta and Saskatchewan.\n\nAs that ridge starts to track east on Thursday, showers are possible in southern Alberta and temperatures will drop slightly.

C.\n\nThe ridge of high pressure that has been adding heat to the west is finally starting to track east, with heat warnings following it as it moves.\n\nBut for Wednesday, heat warnings remain in place for the southern half of Alberta, the B.C. interior, the Yukon, with additional warnings across Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and a number of Maritime provinces.\n\nThe frontal system that is helping push that ridge east brings an increased risk of strong convective activity (thunderstorms) for Thursday and Friday.\n\nOnce again, there is an slight chance Calgary might see some thunderstorms on Thursday, but a good chance of strong storm development around the capital region and into southern Saskatchewan overnight.\n\nDaytime highs will drop down to around 24 C to 25 C for the weekend, with another bump in temperatures expected by Monday.", "source": {"uri": "calgary.ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV Newsnet                        "}, "authors": [],

The full-back, widely regarded as one of Super League's greatest ever players, is now set to make his return in Perpignan against Hull FC next week.\n\nTomkins retired at the end of last season, with his last game coming in the Grand Final against former club Wigan Warriors. However, he will now return to the Dragons squad nine months later, with the French side having a number of injuries to key players.\n\nThe news was broken on Sky Sports this Friday evening, with Jenna Brooks reporting Tomkins' sensational return. The full-back has been training with the side in recent weeks, declaring he is 'ready' to play, both physically and mentally.\n\nClick here - Get the latest news on our Rugby League Live WhatsApp channel\n\n\"I didn't think this would be happening, but I'm excited be back playing for Catalans,\" Tomkins said. \"I'm passionate about the club so when Steve asked about the possibility of me returning to the playing group, I couldn't say no.\n\n\"The time since last year's grand final has given me time to recover physically and mentally, I'm ready. I have been training for the last few weeks and feel good, so I look forward to adding to what is already a talented group of players for the remaining games of 2024.\"\n\nThe now-35-year-old has over 350 first-grade appearances to his name, having debuted at Wigan in 2008. Starring at full-back, Tomkins played over 200 times for the Cherry and Whites, winning three Super League titles and two Challenge Cups before moving to NRL club New Zealand Warriors.\n\nHe returned to Wigan in 2016 before signing with Catalans in 2019. He played over 100 games for the Dragons, hanging up the boots after the Old Trafford final.\n\nSince then, Tomkins has worked as a pundit on Sky, with Catalans coach Steve McNamara saying it was a 'no brainer' to register him as a player again.\n\n\"With the time he's had to rest, rehab, and freshen up, Sam has looked outstanding when joining in our training sessions,\" McNamara added. \"From a simple question about how he'd feel about playing again, a flame was lit.\n\n\"I've never seen him as excited as this before. Witnessing him both physically and mentally, it was a no brainer for us to register him.

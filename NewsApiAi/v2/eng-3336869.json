Marasigan and his brother, Cristopher, but the police have formed a task force to look into the slays, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said on Friday.\n\n\"There are still no leads,\" Dominguez said of the killing of Marasigan, who was his communications consultant, and Cristopher.\n\nThe Marasigan brothers were killed after they were ambushed by still unidentified men on a motorcycle in San Juan City around 6:10 p.m. on Thursday.\n\n\"I hope they will report positive results,\" Dominguez said, adding that he had already asked three high-ranking police officials to prioritize the case.\n\nOne of the officials was Eastern Police District (EPD) director Chief Supt. Romulo Sapitula, who created \"Task Force Marasigan\" to look into the double murder.\n\nThe task force, Sapitula said, will be headed by EPD deputy director for operations Senior Supt. Florendo Quibuyen.\n\nBefore he became press and public relations officer of the Department of Finance, Michael, 60, had been managing editor of BusinessWorld and former independent video producer at Living Asia Channel.\n\nHe had also been a press agent for several companies and individuals, including Tagum Development Corp., owned by the family of Davao del Norte Rep. Antonio Floirendo.\n\nThe San Juan City police chief, Senior Supt. Lawrence Coop, said the brothers were on a metallic-gray Mazda CX5, with plate No. WOU 583, and were traveling along V. Cruz Street toward Barcelona Street when they were attacked around 6:10 p.m.\n\nThe police believe the perpetrators followed the victims from Michael's home on Valentin Street in Barangay Onse, where he was fetched by Cristopher who also lived nearby.\n\nBarangay Santa Lucia watchman Troy Chavez said the brothers' vehicle was nearing Barcelona Street, frequently used by motorists going to Quezon City, Makati City and Mandaluyong City, when the assailants on a black motorcycle approached the SUV.\n\nThere were no closed-circuit television cameras installed in the area, Chavez said.\n\nThe back rider alighted and fired at the right side of the vehicle at least 34 times with no less than two pistols.\n\nBullet casings found on the scene were for 9mm and caliber .45 rounds, probers said.\n\nMichael, who was in the front passenger seat, sustained at least eight visible gunshot wounds in the chest and two in the neck while Cristopher had 14, Sapitula said.\n\nCristopher, 50, was still alive when he was removed from the vehicle and rushed to San Juan Medical Hospital, but was declared dead upon arrival at the hospital.\n\nSapitula said Marasigan family members were cooperating with the authorities although they were still shocked by the killings.\n\nCoop said investigators were exploring all possible angles, including business interests, but robbery or drugs appeared to be the least likely motives.\n\nCristopher's son, Christian, believed the likely target was Michael since Cristopher had no business interests and had been Michael's driver for 15 years.\n\nChristian, quoting Sapitula, said the barrage of gunfire was evidently directed at Michael and there were no known threats against Cristopher.\n\nThe family intends to have a one-day wake at Arlington Funeral in Quezon City.\n\nMichael's longtime colleague Teddy Montelibano said the killings also shocked friends in the media community.\n\n\"I can attest to the character of Mike,\" said Montelibano, who worked with Michael for many years at BusinessWorld. \"How can he have an enemy? Who would have wanted to kill him in that manner?\"\n\n\"It is also strange as he was working as a consultant for Dominguez at the Department of Finance. He is a friend of the administration,\" Montelibano said.\n\nThorough professional\n\n\"As my communications consultant, [Michael] was always prompt, thorough and very good at what he did,\" Dominguez said.\n\n\"I have known Mike for over 30 years. I and his peers held him in very high regard for his skills and thorough professionalism,\" Dominguez added.\n\n\"Mike, who always had a kind word to everyone he meets, was a highly respected journalist and public relations man,\" he said.\n\nWork-related\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidential Task Force on Media Security condemned the killings, although it was uncertain whether the slays were related to Michael's work while he was still a journalist.\n\nThe task force's executive director, Undersecretary Joel Sy Egco, said he had already asked the police to get to the bottom of the incident.\n\n\"While it is yet to be confirmed if this incident falls under the mandate of the task force in relation to the Administrative Order No. 1 of President Duterte in protecting the life, liberty and security of media workers, there is a possibility that the killing may be related to Marasigan's previous work as a journalist,\" he said in a statement. -- WITH LEILA B.

  "body": "MANILA -- Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II ordered the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) on Friday to investigate the killing of Michael D. Marasigan, a former journalist who was shot dead in San Juan City Thursday night.\n\nAguirre issued Department Order No. 515 directing NBI Director Dante Gierran to conduct a probe and case build-up on the killing of Marasigan and his brother, Christopher, who was with him inside the vehicle when the gunmen riding a motorcycle fired at them.\n\nRead: Former journalist shot dead in San Juan City\n\n\"I have signed a Department Order instructing the NBI to conduct a parallel investigation into the Aug. 3, 2017 gun attack that killed former media man, Michael D. Marasigan and his brother, businessman Christopher D. Marasigan in San Juan City,\" Aguirre said upon being informed of the incident.\n\nMarasigan worked as a communication consultant in the Department of Finance (DOF).\n\n\"Aside from catching the perpetrators, we want to know the real motives behind the attack on the victims. Is it because of Michael Marasigan's work as a media personality? Is it because of his previous employment with the Department of Finance? As the designated head of President Duterte's Task Force on Media Security, I am duty-bound to order this probe to get to the bottom of the attack. Our goal is to prevent similar attacks in the future. We want our NBI to explore all angles,\" Aguirre added.\n\nMarasigan was a former editor of Business Day and pioneered one of the country's first digitized newspapers -- BusinessWorld Online, becoming its first online chief editor. He was also an independent producer for the Living Asia channel and the creator of ourphilippines.tv.\n\nFor his part, DOF Secretary Carlos Dominguez III has called on law enforcement authorities to find and prosecute to the fullest extent of the law the perpetrators behind the killing of Marasigan, his communications consultant.\n\n\"I am both saddened and shocked,\" Dominguez said. \"My deepest condolences go to the family of Mike and that of his brother, Christopher.\"\n\n\"I have known Mike for over 30 years. I and his peers held him in very high regard for his skills and thorough professionalism,\" he added.\n\nThe DOF chief said Marasigan, who always had a kind word to everyone he meets,\" was a highly respected journalist and public relations man.\"\n\n\"As my communications consultant, he was always prompt, thorough and very good at what he did, which was to assist the DOF in relaying its key messages and programs to the public,\" he said.

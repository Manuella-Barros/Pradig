Contrary to the dystopian narrative that AI will lead to widespread job displacement, a more nuanced and likely scenario is unfolding. It is not AI alone that will replace people, but rather people equipped with AI tools who will replace those who are not. This paradigm shift underscores the importance of integrating AI into the workforce, highlighting how the symbiosis between humans and AI can redefine productivity, efficiency, and creativity. This blog explores how this integration will reshape the workforce and define the future of work, examining both the positive and negative implications of this transition.\n\nAI excels at processing vast amounts of data, identifying patterns, and performing repetitive tasks with unparalleled speed and accuracy. However, AI lacks the nuanced understanding, emotional intelligence, and creative problem-solving abilities inherent to humans. The future of work lies not in choosing between human or AI capabilities but in leveraging the strengths of both. When humans harness AI as a tool, they enhance their own skill sets, leading to increased productivity, innovation, and decision-making capabilities.\n\nTo begin with, organizations will reap enhanced productivity and efficiency. AI tools can automate routine tasks, freeing up humans to focus on complex problem-solving, strategic planning, and creative endeavors. This division of labor maximizes efficiency and productivity, allowing businesses to achieve more with the same resources.\n\nIn addition, enterprises expect increased innovation. By analyzing data and trends, AI can identify opportunities for innovation that might not be immediately apparent to humans. When people use AI to guide their explorations, they can push the boundaries of creativity, leading to breakthroughs in products, services, and processes.\n\nFurthermore, companies look to AI for improved decision making. AI's ability to process and analyze data at scale enhances human decision-making. People using AI can access insights and predictions based on comprehensive data analysis, leading to more informed and strategic choices.\n\nIn addition, this creates the opportunity for personalized learning and development. AI can tailor learning experiences to individual workers, identifying skills gaps and recommending personalized training. This fosters a culture of continuous learning and adaptability, crucial for staying relevant in a rapidly changing job market.\n\nFinally, there is the creation of new job categories. As AI takes over routine tasks, new roles will emerge that focus on managing, interpreting, and leveraging AI technologies. This evolution will lead to the creation of jobs that we can scarcely imagine today, driving forward economic growth and innovation.\n\nHowever, integrating AI into business poses drawbacks as well. First, there is the inevitable issue of skill disparities and job displacement. The divide between those who can effectively use AI and those who cannot, will lead to job displacement and widening skill gaps. Workers unable to adapt to AI-driven environments may find themselves at a disadvantage, highlighting the need for widespread AI literacy and retraining programs.\n\nSecond, this will lead to further AI usage concerns on ethics and privacy. Integrating AI into the workplace raises ethical questions around surveillance, data privacy, and the potential for algorithmic bias. Businesses must navigate these issues carefully to maintain trust and ensure fair treatment of employees.\n\nThird, the workforce will see increased pressure on the workers. The efficiency and productivity gains from AI could lead to heightened expectations for human workers, potentially increasing stress and workloads. Balancing AI's capabilities with human well-being will be a critical challenge for organizations.\n\nFourth, the issues on the digital divide, particularly economic inequality, will increase. The benefits of AI may disproportionately favor those with the skills and resources to leverage it, exacerbating economic inequality. Addressing this disparity requires concerted efforts from governments, educational institutions, and businesses to ensure broad access to AI training and opportunities.\n\nTo navigate the transition towards an AI-augmented workforce successfully, several strategies must be implemented:\n\n\u00b7 Invest in AI Literacy and Skills Training: Businesses and educational institutions must prioritize AI literacy, offering training programs to equip workers with the skills needed to collaborate with AI technologies effectively.\n\n\u00b7 Develop Ethical AI Guidelines: Organizations should establish clear ethical guidelines for AI use that prioritize transparency, fairness, and privacy, ensuring that AI tools are used responsibly.\n\n\u00b7 Foster a Culture of Continuous Learning: Encouraging a mindset of continuous learning and adaptability among employees will be key to navigating the evolving work landscape. Supporting workers through transitions and encouraging experimentation with AI tools can cultivate a resilient and innovative workforce.\n\n\u00b7 Implement Supportive Policies and Infrastructure: Governments and businesses should collaborate to create policies and infrastructures that support workers displaced or affected by AI, including retraining programs, social safety nets, and incentives for businesses to invest in human capital.\n\nThe integration of AI into the workforce presents both significant opportunities and challenges. The future will not be about AI replacing humans but about the synergistic potential of humans and AI working together. Those who embrace and learn to leverage AI will set themselves apart, driving forward innovation, efficiency, and growth. As we stand on the brink of this transformative era, the emphasis must be on preparing the workforce for the future, ensuring that AI serves as a tool for empowerment rather than a source of displacement. By adopting strategic, ethical, and inclusive approaches to AI integration, we can pave the way for a future where the collaboration between humans and AI leads to unprecedented levels of achievement and prosperity.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Problem solving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Division of labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paradigm shift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emotional intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithmic bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_safety_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social safety net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Career_and_Job_Advancement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Career and Job Advancement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b57fc23a90ee2e4823bc16/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Overcoming these issues early on will be key to ensuring that this technological revolution does not hit a roadblock, which could severely stunt its growth. The solution? Decentralize AI through blockchain.\n\nThe study and development of AI have been around for much longer than most people realize. The concept of AI came around as early as the 1950s, with John McCarthy coining the term at a workshop and later inventing the programming language LISP, which is still widely used today. Jump forward a few decades, and we now have personalized AI systems, similar to what Apple recently announced, at our fingertips.\n\nBut this rapid development has not been without its drawbacks. 2023 saw significant privacy concerns with AI, with OpenAI's ChatGPT reportedly having user data leaks, raising concerns about the security and privacy of AI tools. This led to instances where, for example, Samsung banned ChatGPT on company property with fears of intellectual property being leaked, or Italy's data protection authority temporarily banned ChatGPT nationwide due to concerns over breach of privacy rules.\n\nDecentralizing AI would bring a new standard of user safety, transparency, and a high degree of empowerment to AI. However, most people still misunderstand the concept of AI on blockchain. What we see as \"AI on blockchain\" today is a Web3 ecosystem that runs some of its processes on blockchain but offloads compute-intensive workloads, including the use and execution of AI, to pre-existing centralized platforms. Truly decentralized AI would mean building AI models on blockchain, where training, usage and execution occur through smart contracts, effectively making the AI much more secure, transparent and tamper-proof.\n\nThe benefits of AI on-chain are countless, and they solve the problems associated with centralized AI. The significant upside of it is security: decentralization of AI ensures there are no single points of failure, so malicious actors cannot easily subvert the system. Moreover, the transparency of blockchain guarantees that the processes through which AI makes decisions are verifiable and auditable, making the process generally trusted.\n\nAnother key benefit of this is data privacy. Decentralized AI will give much-needed power back to the user, allowing them to understand and control what data is used to build these large models. With more clarity on what goes into the AI, primarily due to blockchain's highly transparent characteristic, we reduce the risk of private data being used or abused, reducing potential security threats based on centralized data storage and processing.\n\nDecentralization also fosters inclusive and democratized AI technology that is open to mass participation without the gatekeeping strategies of centralized entities. In other words, it will make the AI landscape a more level playing field, ensuring equity and greater innovation.\n\nBut despite these pros, there are difficulties in pushing AI on-chain. One such drawback is the cost of performance in decentralized AI systems. The inherent complexities of consensus mechanisms and distributed processing are precursors to speed and efficiency, meaning decentralized AI systems might not favorably compete with their centralized counterparts.\n\nThe need for each node in the network to reach a consensus before transactions are confirmed incurs latency and undermines overall performance. The scalability issues currently present in some blockchain technology will also be crucial to the successful execution of superior AI models. These two factors necessitate appropriate reparation in the blockchain backbone so that AI workloads can be run efficiently.\n\nOn a macro level, AI hypergrowth is changing how we interact with the digital world and powering innovations in virtually every other industry. The centralization of AI does bring significant risks and challenges that decentralized AI has the potential to lessen. Bringing AI on-chain points to a possible path toward a more secure, transparent, and inclusive future, entirely dependent on how blockchain evolves to run AI effectively.\n\nAI and blockchain integration will become the most critical single factor, by a wide margin, in launching a new wave in AI development. This intersection will solve current problems but open up new forms of innovation for decentralized and intelligent digital ecosystems. It provides the fundamental transformation of AI to empower people with innovation and drive toward a digital future.

A few years back, no one would have thought how generative AI would take over the world (in a good way of course). On the occasion of AI Appreciation Day, let's explore the benefits of AI and how it will help startups take their business to the next level!\n\nEvery year July 16th is commemorated as AI Appreciation Day! It's dedicated to celebrating the incredible advancements and impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Today AI has transformed our daily lives and revolutionised various industries, especially with the introduction of generative AI models.\n\nAI Appreciation Day was established back in May 2021 by A.I. Heart LLC, an AI company. The main goal of this day was to promote AI ethics and highlight the achievements of AI in various fields such as science, healthcare, business, finance, etc.\n\nWhile artificial intelligence is not a new concept, its theory dates back to the 1700s. However, it came to fruition around the 1950s invented by two computer scientists Alan Turing and John McCarthy.\n\nThe trend of large language models started after the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT. This innovative generative AI bot can perform various tasks and automate repetitive work easily. Soon tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, Meta and startups like Anthropic launched their own AI chatbots.\n\nThese AI bots can handle customer queries quickly, complete tasks such as text-to-image conversion, curate content, produce tailored audio and much more. Right now there's fierce competition between tech companies to develop a better AI chatbot than popular rivals like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude 3.5, etc. Small businesses can leverage AI chatbots to improve customer engagement and provide personalised content.\n\nWith the help of AI tools, business professionals and entrepreneurs can do more than convert plain data into graphical or visual content. These tools are capable of identifying trends and actionable information to optimise business operations. Moreover, data visualisation AI tools can perform predictive analysis to help in decision-making by detecting patterns. Making the right decisions can make or break a business. AI tools can help companies strategise with data-driven insights.\n\nAI tools provide outputs according to the text prompts. Earlier generative AI models were capable of providing content (like articles, and blog posts) and audio. With recent developments, LLMs can also produce high-quality videos that replicate real-life dynamics. Some notable examples include OpenAI's Sora and the Chinese AI model Kling. Moreover, AI models can even provide mixed outputs i.e. text with images! Meta has successfully developed Chameleon AI that can perform mixed media tasks easily.\n\nBranding is the key asset of a business which helps it stand out from competitors. AI-powered tools can help startups build unique designs and content that resonates with their vision.\n\nThe impact of AI on the business world is vast and significant. It is undeniable that AI has revolutionised how companies operate by automating tasks, improving decision-making, and enhancing customer engagement.

Differing attitudes of China and the United States toward the governance of AI as a revolutionary technology profoundly shape the policy roadmaps of the two AI superpowers.\n\nHolding the largest shares of advanced AI technology and industrial innovation globally, the role of both great powers is crucial for setting norms around the responsible use of AI. The regulatory approaches adopted by China and the US carry global significance as they are outpacing each other to gain dominance in the field of AI.\n\nThe Chinese government has adopted an orchestrated technique to emerge as a global leader to rule the world in the field of AI by 2030, as embodied in its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan. It has also announced strategic long-term plans like \"Made in China 2025\" to achieve self-sufficiency in AI technology. The projection of China's AI market reaching $61 Billion by 2025, highlights the country's significant progress in AI technology and industrial growth. However, it is essential to understand how China being an emerging powerhouse of AI innovation looks at AI Governance.\n\nChina's approach towards AI Governance is state-driven where the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has exclusive control over companies to ensure social stability. Over the past few years, China has adopted a series of regulations specifically targeting AI companies. These measures are formulated to ensure that the development of AI is aligned with national policies and objectives. CCP has significant control of the digital economy and reinforces its political values.\n\nChina has formulated a series of policy documents and public pronouncements that are elaborating on the country's governance regime on Artificial Intelligence. For instance, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) together with the other relevant governmental agencies promulgated regulations, such as the Regulation on Algorithmic Recommendation of Internet Information Services. These regulations stipulate that algorithmic recommendations should not lead minors towards addiction, treat users in non-discriminatory ways, and give users greater leverage in personalized recommendations. While China does not impose heavy fines for non-compliance with these regulations, the government certainly has the control to suspend operations of the AI systems violating the rules.\n\nThe US emphasises market-driven policy which is based on innovation, expeditious development, and stationing of trailblazing AI technologies. It also allows for fostering international partnerships and collaborations, which makes the US a global leader in AI research and development, stimulating shared advancement and standards. The US market-driven model is based on industrial standards that can be adopted globally, shaping the AI governance structure of other countries. The US market-driven approach propagates economic growth through AI-powered innovations that can influence global economic trajectories.\n\nWhile the US shares a global vision for AI governance, it desires to dominate the field of AI technology and innovation. In 2020, the US Congress passed the National AI Initiative Act (NAIIA), which focuses on ensuring \"continued U.S. leadership in AI research and development.\" The US is taking measures to control exports of semiconductor chips and adopting an economic isolationism policy to consolidate its hegemony in AI technologies and to restrict China's AI development. For this purpose, the US passed its Science and CHIP Act in 2022, which allocates $53 billion to chip manufacturing companies and is aimed at bringing microchip manufacturing back to the US. Under the CHIP Act, chipmakers who receive funding from the Act are restricted from expanding their facilities in China and some other countries. This escalates technology rivalry, disturbs the AI supply chain, and has a pessimistic effect on global AI Cooperation, especially the regulations of AI technology.\n\nThe US approach towards regulation of AI is based on economic liberalism which enthuses the free market and minimal influence of government. This model allows private sectors to pioneer freely. Except when concerns arise about national security. In recent years, this approach has been criticised because a few big tech companies are dominating powers that neglect the societal effect and principles.\n\nThe divergence approach of China and America in AI governance has significant global ramifications. As these nations are disseminating technologies, divergence in models of AI governance allows nations to adopt these competing prototypes, opening a new battleground for competition. Tech conglomerates of the US inclination for open markets and innovations got significant importance at the international level. US AI technologies are ubiquitously adopted setting a yardstick for international standards. Nonetheless, China's Expeditious advancements and rivalrous pricing render it is AI solution admired by developing nations.\n\nChina aims to become a global leader in the field of AI with its remarkable innovations. China's AI strategy includes ambiguous applications that are based on extensive surveillance and social control systems. The AI Governance Model adopted by the US and its primary consideration is global leadership in the innovation of AI technologies. Caught in the crossfire of this contestation, AI technology is vulnerable to becoming a source of global conflict. However, as both powers strive to achieve self-sufficiency and deny critical technology to the other, the chances of formation of 'likeminded' coalitions and their confrontations become more likely. This will have negative consequences for the global supply chain of AI technology.\n\nChina and the US have different approaches regarding their AI models. The US prioritises a collaborative framework that advocates transparency and individual rights. In contrast, China's AI Governance Model focuses on technological advancement economic growth, and societal control. The global landscape will be shaped as these two superpowers are continuously enhancing their AI Capabilities. The intensifying geopolitical competition and the nature of AI technology constitute a major threat to global peace, and collaboration on regulating AI technology is essential.\n\nDespite differing approaches to AI governance, advanced AI powers share an interest in ensuring the responsible use of AI technology. Countries around the world will need to navigate to benefit from emerging technology to follow ethical rules and protect human rights. Contrarily, the outcome of this antagonism will influence the future of global AI development and its ramifications on society.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace_Administration_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cyberspace Administration of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_China_2025", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Made in China 2025"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autarky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet Information Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isolationism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hegemony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_and_Society", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business and Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-140.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Kenny Ingram, VP for construction and engineering, looks at how to overcome the barriers to fully realising the huge potential of AI in UK construction\n\nThe UK construction industry faces ongoing uncertainty. Economic pressures, global tensions and political volatility contribute to a challenging environment.\n\nHowever, like many industries, it faces the need to modernise and adapt to emerging technologies to maintain its competitive edge. Artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, offers vast potential for transforming construction processes, enhancing efficiency and driving innovation.\n\nThe enthusiasm within the UK construction sector for AI is palpable. Recent research commissioned by IFS reveals that more than three-quarters (76%) of senior construction and engineering decision-makers at large firms say their organisations hold high expectations for AI.\n\nAdditionally, over two-thirds (68%) believe their industry is adopting AI at a faster pace than others. This optimism is driven by the recognition that AI can significantly enhance market knowledge, drive product and service innovation and support consistent business growth.\n\nThe opportunities AI presents to the construction industry are many and diverse.\n\nAI can streamline project management, improve safety protocols, optimise supply chain logistics and enhance predictive maintenance.\n\nBy analysing vast amounts of data, AI can provide insights that lead to more informed decision-making and better project outcomes.\n\nFor instance, AI algorithms can predict potential project delays, allowing for pre-emptive action and improved scheduling.\n\nAt the same time, AI-driven design tools can create more efficient building plans, reducing material waste and costs.\n\nDespite the clear advantages, the construction sector faces significant challenges in fully leveraging AI.\n\nWhile 76% of leaders report a high level of architectural readiness for AI adoption, there are notable concerns about the quality of AI resources, particularly human skills.\n\nOver a third (36%) of respondents rate the quality of AI skills in their business as merely passable, highlighting a gap between the industry's aspirations and its current capabilities.\n\nThis skills gap is further exacerbated by the fact that more than a quarter (27%) of firms do not prioritise upskilling, which is crucial for effective AI implementation.\n\nThe journey toward AI integration varies across the industry.\n\nWhile 36% of firms have developed clear strategies and are reaping tangible benefits from their AI initiatives, 31% are still in the proposal-gathering stage for pilot projects.\n\nMeanwhile, another 31% are in the research phase, reflecting a cautious yet determined effort to understand AI's implications fully. This disparity indicates that while some companies are forging ahead, others are still laying the groundwork for future AI adoption.\n\nSeveral obstacles are hindering the widespread adoption of AI in the construction and engineering sector.\n\nA significant barrier is the legacy technology landscape, with 42% of respondents identifying it as a factor slowing their progress. This reliance on outdated systems makes it challenging to integrate new AI technologies seamlessly.\n\nAdditionally, 41% of respondents expressed uncertainty about potential AI use cases within their business, underlining the need for clearer strategic direction and better understanding of AI's applications.\n\nOvercoming these challenges is paramount for the construction industry to fully benefit from AI.\n\nA strategic approach that includes investment in the right resources, particularly in upskilling the workforce, is essential.\n\nBuilding a robust AI infrastructure that can support new technologies while phasing out legacy systems will also be critical. Companies need to foster a culture of innovation and continuous learning to keep pace with the rapid advancements in AI.\n\nThe benefits of successfully integrating AI into UK construction are substantial. Firms that effectively leverage AI can expect enhanced efficiency, reduced costs, improved safety and greater innovation.\n\nAI can lead to smarter project management, with real-time data analysis allowing for better resource allocation and risk management.\n\nSafety is another area where AI can make a significant impact, with predictive analytics helping to identify and mitigate potential hazards before they occur.\n\nFurthermore, AI-driven innovation can open up new business opportunities and revenue streams, positioning companies at the forefront of the industry.\n\nWhile the UK construction sector is eager to embrace AI, it must address several challenges to fully realise its potential.\n\nBy prioritising upskilling, modernising technology infrastructure and developing clear AI strategies, the industry can overcome these obstacles.\n\nThe rewards for doing so are clear: a more efficient, innovative and competitive construction sector that is well positioned to meet the demands of both the present and the future.", "source": {"uri": "pbctoday.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Planning, BIM & Construction Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_brundrett@pbctoday.co.uk", "name": "Matt Brundrett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Construction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emerging technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_maintenance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Predictive maintenance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legacy system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Project management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_allocation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Resource allocation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Predictive analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution_Prevention_and_Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution Prevention and Recycling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.pbctoday.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iStock-1731447148.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The AI Act will enter into force on August 1, 2024. This article intends to provide a brief overview of the scope and key requirements of the AI Act.\n\nWhat Are the Key Definitions Under the AI Act?\n\nArticle 3 of the AI Act contains 68 definitions. The following four definitions are key in understanding whether an organization is subject to the AI Act and if so, what obligations it is subject to:\n\nWhat Is the Scope of the AI Act?\n\nFor organizations in the process of assessing whether they are subject to the AI Act, it is important to carefully evaluate the scope of application of the AI Act.\n\nThe AI Act introduces a risk-based legal framework that imposes requirements based on the level and type of risks related to the use of the concerned AI system. The AI Act establishes the following types of AI systems: (i) prohibited AI systems, (ii) high-risk AI systems, (iii) AI systems with transparency requirements, and (iv) general-purpose AI models, each of which are defined below. The types of AI systems are not mutually exclusive. For example, a high-risk system may also be subject to transparency requirements.\n\nThe obligations of the AI Act are largely focused on providers and deployers of AI systems. There are circumstances where the rules under the AI Act apply to other parties, such as importers, distributors and product manufacturers, but those are more limited.\n\nIt is important to note that that any deployer, distributor, importer or other third-party may have to assume the role of the provider in certain cases, including when: (i) they put their name or trademark on a high-risk system already placed on the market or put into service, without putting in place contractual arrangements that stipulate that the obligations are allocated otherwise; (ii) they make a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system that had already been placed on the market or had already been put into service and it remains a high-risk AI system notwithstanding the modification; (iii) they modify the intended purpose of an AI system which had originally not been classified as high-risk and had already been placed on the market or put into service, in such a manner that the AI system becomes high-risk.\n\nProhibited AI systems are AI systems and/or uses of AI that have been deemed unacceptable from a fundamental rights perspective and are, therefore, prohibited. These include:\n\n2. High-Risk AI Systems\n\nHigh-risk AI systems are deemed to present a potentially high-risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals and are subject to stringent obligations. The AI Act differentiates between two buckets of high-risk AI systems.\n\nThe first bucket comprises AI systems that are considered high-risk under EU harmonization legislation (see Article 6(1) and Annex I of the AI Act). An AI system in this category will be considered high-risk when: (i) it is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or the AI system is itself a product covered by the EU harmonization legislation identified in Annex I of the AI Act and (ii) the product or system has to undergo a third-party conformity assessment under applicable EU harmonization legislation. This will likely cover many AI systems used in, for example, machinery, toys, lifts, equipment and safety components for use in medical devices, civil aviation related products and various types of vehicles.\n\nThe second bucket comprises AI systems that are considered high-risk because they are used for specific tasks directly identified in Annex III of the AI Act. These include:\n\nIn addition, certain AI systems that are used in the areas of law enforcement, migration, asylum and border management, and administration of justice and democratic processes, are also considered high-risk.\n\n2.1 Obligations of Providers of High-Risk AI Systems\n\nThe AI Act allocates obligations based on the organization's role in the development or deployment of an AI system (e.g., providers or deployers). Within this context, the AI Act subjects providers of high-risk AI systems to the majority of and to the strictest requirements under the new law, including:\n\n2.2 Obligations of Deployers of High-Risk AI Systems\n\nDeployers of high-risk AI systems will also have a significant number of direct obligations under the AI Act, although these are more limited in scope than the providers' obligations. The deployers' obligations include:\n\n3. Systems with Transparency Requirements\n\nAI systems with transparency requirements are those that pose specific transparency risks or may mislead end-users due to their nature. The AI Act requires providers and deployers to comply with specific transparency rules designed to mitigate such risks. This type of AI system includes:\n\nThe specific obligations on providers and deployers vary according to the specific AI system in question, but may include disclosure obligations, labelling obligations and transparency obligations vis-a-vis the user.\n\n4. General-Purpose AI Models\n\nDue to their flexibility, versatility and capability to form the basis of multiple AI systems, general-purpose AI models are regulated as a separate category from AI systems. The AI Act places specific obligations on providers of general-purpose AI models including:\n\nProviders of general-purpose AI models that are deemed to be presenting a systemic risk will be subject to additional, more stringent, requirements, such as an obligation to ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection and to assess and mitigate possible systemic risks at an EU level. At this stage, only the most advanced general-purpose AI models are likely to be considered as having a systemic risk based on their capabilities.\n\nWhat Are the Penalties?\n\nMarket Surveillance Authorities under the AI Act will have the power to impose significant penalties for infringements, particularly monetary fines. The level of fines varies depending on the type of infringement:\n\nDistinct from the fines listed above, the European Commission also has the power to impose fines on providers of general-purpose AI models. Specifically, it may impose fines of \u20ac15 million or 3% of total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding year, whichever is higher.\n\nNatural or legal persons can also submit a complaint to a Market Surveillance Authority if they consider that an infringement of the AI Act has taken place.\n\nWhen Will It Apply?\n\nThe AI Act will enter into force 20 days following its publication, i.e., on August 1, 2024. However, the provisions will become applicable following a transition period. The length of the transition period will vary depending on the type of AI system:\n\nIt is worth noting that certain AI systems and models already on the market may be exempt or have longer compliance deadlines.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Systemic risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion_Detection_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion Detection Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Roulette", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Roulette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Lindenmayer_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Lindenmayer Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-07-", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 10}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Then why not ensure that access to it is equitable. AI should take all of us to the future, not just a handful of fortunate ones.\n\nThe debate about whether AI is a job killer or not has been raging for a while, with some experts saying jobs will change but not be eliminated, while others are tugging the alarm bells quite hard. AI will impact 60% of jobs in advanced economies and 40% of jobs around the world in the next two years, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nNow with Gen AI speeding up human-like robot development, the job loss possibility from arrival of Gen AI will cover not just writers, artists, and customer care reps, but also labour intensive jobs.\n\nAnd layoffs are happening. At the beginning of the year, Google laid off an unspecified number of employees, as did Amazon. The fact that these layoffs follow big tech super investments in AI hasn't escaped the attention of many.\n\nThose belonging to the camp that AI will create new jobs are optimistic that the advent of this technology is important in the long run for humanity's interface with technology.\n\nNitin Seth, Co-founder and CEO of Conversive, a SaaS platform that builds personalized conversational messaging solutions for professionals and institutes based on data from CRMs and AI-powered chatbots, assured Business Standard that new jobs are definitely going to be created.\n\n\"If there are people who are doing a mundane job and AI can do a better job with more predictability, yes, people are going to prefer automation and AI,\" he says.\n\nBut he says there are areas such as customer care, which is one of the business areas AI has definitely taken over, where humans will be needed.\n\n\"We see a need for a human to talk to the consumers, to the patient, to the job seeker, to the loan applicant, and so on. Those cases will be there. New jobs will be created,\" he assures.\n\nHe adds that business communication companies like his want to offer the expertise of how to write a message which gets a response, how to use a chatbot to get that response. However, at the same time, they need humans to configure those chatbots.\n\nAI companies that are building chatbots and using automation to apply to human jobs are consulting human teams to build them.\n\n\"I believe finally, human nature will evolve, and we'll develop skills which use the AI better. But yeah, the question is out there,\" he adds.\n\n\"Many manual, mundane, and repetitive roles and responsibilities will benefit from automation with AI,\" said Ruban Phukan, CEO of GoodGist, a company that uses AI to upskill workers. \"Even some of the core tech roles, like coding and software testing, will see a fair amount of Gen AI-based automation. This doesn't mean a reduction of jobs but that the nature of the job requirements will change, and maybe for the better.\"\n\nAccording to Phukan, this transformation doesn't diminish the value of traditional software development; instead, it underscores the continuous need for experts in AI, machine learning, and coding to innovate and refine these intelligent systems.\n\n\"As technology advances and AI capabilities expand, new roles will emerge, focusing on training, managing, ethical considerations, integration, and beyond, ensuring that AI contributes positively to society and industry,\" he adds.\n\nIn fact, he sees a significant opportunity in this paradigm shift from pure software development to a broader focus on domain expertise and problem-solving.\n\n\"It enables us to tackle pressing issues more effectively, leveraging the power of AI to scale solutions. In essence, the ultimate goal remains to ensure that technology serves as a catalyst for solutions, not as a source of new problems, echoing the foundational purpose of software to solve, not to complicate,\" he says.\n\nIn fact, many say that we will have so many new jobs involving AI that we'll all be talent hunting.\n\nAs Groq chief Jonathan Ross said in a recent interview with SafeGraph CEO Auren Hoffman, \"We keep thinking of each technology as displacing work. One of the things that is probably going to happen is it will create more jobs for people than we have people ... there will suddenly be a lack of supply of people to do things\".\n\nTech giants are locked in an AI talent arms race looking to fill over 100,000 positions amid scarce supply of generative AI talent, leading to attractive compensation packages. Wipro, in its latest earnings call, announced that it looks to lead in generative AI consulting, training over 225,000 employees to enhance its AI-focused services.\n\n\"We are on the brink of a major technological shift. Every client I talk to across industries is very eager to leverage AI to shape the future of their business, and at Wipro, we have been gearing up for this moment,\" AIM quoted Wipro's new chief Srinivas Pallia during the Indian IT giant's Q4 2024 earnings call.\n\nOther companies in India have been investing steadily in AI, particularly GenAI. Although the results of this quarter haven't been phenomenal, there is progress. AI and generative AI pipeline of TCS, for example, recorded US$900 million. HCLTech also says that they won about seven or eight Gen AI deals in the latest quarter.\n\n\"As we look ahead, global enterprise technology spend will only grow with adoption of AI. We are well positioned to capitalize with our AI-led propositions, global delivery model and ideal mix of technology services and products,\" said C Vijayakumar, CEO & Managing Director, HCLTech.\n\nCompanies like Ola Krutrim, which launched a standalone Android app for its AI chatbot that aims to vie with the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot, are bringing in opportunities.\n\nIt's true that AI is creating big pools of upskilling and reskilling opportunities. Companies now have new positions such as Chief AI Officer, AI Ethicist, and prompt engineers. An MIT Tech Review article recently published the thoughts of a prompt engineer in Greece, who says her role is more than just prompt writing and includes identifying and integrating AI-based solutions for business challenges.\n\n\"The higher tiers of prompt engineering are where the enduring and evolving aspects of the role lie,\" she says.\n\nAt the same time, the speed at which AI self improves could make it a self-consuming job engine.\n\nThe fear that Gen AI will make jobs vanish for writers and such feels very real. But not just writers, at the speed that AI is evolving, even prompt engineers might find themselves jobless if AI self improves at understanding the prompts. In fact, some people are saying this isn't a career at all, just a learning phase in AI.\n\nIs it wise to rush into AI's arms with all that we have when fears of losing to it lurk in the air? But at the rate that AI is transforming industries, we don't seem to have a choice. Then maybe we should embrace it with caution and ensure that access to it is equitable. AI should take all of us to the future, not just a handful of fortunate.", "source": {"uri": "sociable.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sociable"}, "authors": [{"uri": "navanwita_sachdev@sociable.co", "name": "Navanwita Sachdev", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software as a service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer relationship management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipro", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wipro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paradigm shift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Problem solving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Consultancy_Services", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tata Consultancy Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Vijayakumar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "C Vijayakumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://sociable.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/macro-eye-iris.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

This pioneering law seeks to achieve a compromise between the AI industry's need for innovation and the imperatives of upholding fundamental rights and guaranteeing the security and reliability of AI systems. The EU's determination to lead the world in ethical AI governance is reflected in the EU AI Act which upholds citizens' rights and interests while promoting a strong technological environment.\n\nThe primary objective of the EU AI Act is to establish a regulatory environment that ensures AI systems deployed within the EU are safe, transparent, and respect fundamental rights. This is achieved through a risk-based approach that categorises AI systems into different risk levels, each with corresponding regulatory requirements. High-risk AI systems, which pose significant risks to health, safety, or fundamental rights, are subject to stringent regulations, including rigorous testing, documentation, and human oversight.\n\nThe EU AI Act mandates that AI systems must be designed and developed in a manner that upholds fundamental rights, such as privacy, non-discrimination, and data protection. This emphasis on fundamental rights reflects the EU's commitment to creating a human-centric AI landscape, where technology serves the needs and values of society. By prioritizing the safety and rights of individuals, the legislation aims to build public trust in AI technologies, which is crucial for their widespread adoption and acceptance.\n\nThe EU AI Act aims to encourage innovation and competitiveness in the AI industry even as it places stringent limitations on high-risk AI systems.

The intention is to foster innovation by lowering administrative burdens and offering clear legislative rules, which will promote the development of a thriving AI ecosystem in Europe.\n\nFocusing on encouraging cooperation between the public and private sectors is one of the main features of the EU AI Act. To guarantee that AI technologies are created in accordance with societal needs and values, the act promotes collaboration and partnerships between researchers, developers, and regulatory organisations.\n\nBy adopting a risk-based approach to regulation, it recognises that not all AI systems pose the same level of risk. The legislation classifies AI systems into three main categories: unacceptable risk, high risk, and limited risk. This tiered approach allows the EU to tailor its regulatory framework to the specific risks associated with different AI applications, ensuring that regulations are proportionate and effective.\n\nTransparency and accountability are key to the EU AI Act's principles. The law requires AI systems to be open about how they operate and make decisions, especially those that are deemed high-risk. This entails giving consumers information that is easy to comprehend regarding the operation of AI systems, the data they use, and the reasoning behind their choices.\n\nThe statute mandates that high-risk AI systems be created in a way that permits efficient human intervention, underscoring the significance of human control. This guarantees that people maintain control and have the ability to step in when needed to stop damage or fix mistakes, and to ensure that AI technologies are used responsibly and ethically by increasing accountability and transparency.\n\nThe adoption of the EU AI Act establishes the EU as a global leader in AI governance, laying the groundwork for other governments and regions to follow. The EU wants to ensure that AI technologies are used responsibly and ethically, making a positive impact on society, by creating a thorough legal framework.\n\nThe EU's commitment to advancing global collaboration in AI governance is also reflected in the legal framework.

LESS ... MORE\n\nMarc Andreessen said a decade back that Software is eating the world. If that be so, than AI is its teeth. Developers are Dentists, perhaps?\n\nI saw a recent panel discussion in which a panelist says \"You're much better off being a plumber than a programmer\"\n\nIt got me thinking that how much AI is transforming job roles that even developers who are building it aren't safe from its impact. This paradox raises important questions about the future of their roles and careers. The question arises how does a developer or a Technocrat can remain relevant in the ever evolving world of AI.\n\nOne thing is clear that AI and automation are expected to transform, not eliminate, the role of developers. AI has already taken over QA / Bug fixing, Design and slowly taking over development tasks as well. AI can handle repetitive coding tasks, but human intuition and problem solving skills remain largely irreplaceable. As AI takes up low to middle level cognitive tasks in development, Developers will focus more on designing complex systems, architecture, and innovative solutions.\n\nTools like Copilot promise to enhance the productivity of developers by as much as 30% but can they develop an application with a governing architecture from scratch? That is still a few years down the line perhaps. There are AI tools which can help you create design files from wireframes such as Figma or even write SQL queries and basic code snippets but can it understand the context in entirety. They say the best developers are the ones who think more and code less, let's say a better word for optimized code. Still, the tech world is divided whether AI will take over their jobs or not.\n\nMy sense is that in long run, we may have Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) which can be a combination of Business Analyst, Designer, Developer, Devops and QA all in one. In mid term though, rather than viewing AI as a threat, developers can see it as a powerful tool that augments their capabilities.AI powered tools can enhance productivity by generating code for small juse cases, running test cases and scripts, allowing developers to focus on more value added activities.AI can help detect bugs, recurrence, optimize code, do technical documentation and ensure best practices, leading to higher quality software. Trying out new idea is also easier with AI assisting in rapid prototyping, enabling developers to quickly test and iterate on new ideas.\n\nAs AI evolves, new job roles will emerge as that require an interplay of traditional development skills and AI expertise. Some of these jobs roles could be:\n\nI feel we must commit and invest in Lifelong Learning staying updated with the latest advancements in AI, machine learning, and related fields. Regular upskilling can help developers transition into new roles and responsibilities.\n\nThe future will most likely see a symbiotic relationship between humans and AI, where collaboration leads to greater innovation and efficiency. It will be two pronged approach:\n\nAnother important role of Developers as creators of AI is the responsibility to ensure that AI systems are designed and used ethically. Developers must work to identify and mitigate biases in AI systems, ensuring fair and equitable outcomes. We also need to develop XAI which can provide greater transparency.\n\nThe future for developers in an AI driven world is filled with opportunities and challenges. As AI becomes more stronger, also opens up new avenues for innovation and creative thinking.

However, it also warned of challenges around data privacy, potential bias in algorithmic decision-making and the need to ensure AI systems comply with existing laws.\n\n\"As consumers and businesses increasingly look to leverage AI, it is critical that lawmakers and regulators keep pace,\" McHenry said in a news release. \"This report represents a bipartisan effort to understand the benefits, and potential risks, of artificial intelligence in the financial services and housing industries. It also highlights the need for proper oversight and consumer protections that address the growing number of use cases for artificial intelligence.\"\n\nThe report comes as financial firms increasingly experiment with advanced AI capabilities, including generative AI systems like ChatGPT. While many institutions have used traditional machine learning models for years, newer AI technologies are opening up novel applications.\n\nThe AI Working Group held six roundtables to explore how the finance industry is using AI. Regulators told the group that AI could lead to bias and discrimination that might be harder to spot. They stressed that firms using AI must still follow anti-discrimination laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said if a lender can't explain why AI denied a loan, it's breaking the law.\n\nAccording to participants in the roundtables, banks and investment firms are cautiously adopting AI, especially for public-facing tasks. Many have used machine learning for years to crunch data. Now, they're testing newer AI to help with research, watch for market issues and improve trading. But there are risks. Too many firms using similar AI models could cause herd-like market behavior.\n\nIn housing and insurance, AI is changing how companies work. It's helping to approve loans and insurance, screen renters, serve customers better and analyze data.\n\nFor example, AI underwriting models have shown promise in approving more borrowers from underserved communities in mortgage lending. One company reported a 177% increase in loan approvals for Black applicants using AI-based underwriting.\n\nHowever, the working group also heard concerns that AI could perpetuate or even exacerbate historical biases in lending if it is not carefully designed and monitored. Consumer advocates stressed the need for human oversight and the right for consumers to appeal AI-driven decisions.\n\nOn the regulatory front, agencies emphasized in the roundtables that the use of AI does not absolve financial institutions from complying with existing laws. The report noted: \"Several regulators commented that regulated entities are expected to follow all laws, including anti-discrimination and other consumer protection laws, in a tech-neutral manner.\"\n\nThe Treasury Department, in a separate report mandated by President Joe Biden's AI executive order, highlighted cybersecurity risks posed by AI in finance. It warned of a growing technological gap between large institutions with resources to develop in-house AI capabilities and smaller firms that may need to rely more heavily on third-party vendors.\n\nThe House panel's report outlined several recommendations for policymakers, including ensuring financial regulators have appropriate tools and expertise to oversee new AI products and services, reviewing data privacy laws and promoting U.S. leadership in setting global standards for responsible AI development in finance.\n\nThe working group also stressed the need for clearer definitions and a common lexicon around AI in finance, noting confusion even among experts about precise meanings of terms like \"machine learning\" and \"generative AI.\"\n\nWhile the report did not call for immediate legislation, it suggested Congress may need to address regulatory gaps as AI becomes more sophisticated and widely adopted throughout the financial system.\n\n\"The Committee must ensure regulators apply and enforce existing laws, including anti-discrimination laws, and assess regulatory gaps as market participants adopt AI,\" the report said.\n\nAs AI capabilities continue to advance rapidly, the House panel's work suggests financial regulators and lawmakers will need to remain vigilant and adaptable.\n\n\"The Committee should ensure U.S. Global Leadership on AI Development and Use,\" the report concluded, highlighting the importance of maintaining American competitiveness while addressing potential risks.\n\nThe transformative potential of AI in finance is clear, but so are the challenges of ensuring its benefits are realized equitably and safely. The committee's findings set the stage for ongoing debate about how best to foster innovation while protecting consumers and maintaining the financial system's integrity.\n\nOn Tuesday (July 23), the House Financial Services Committee will convene a hearing titled \"AI Innovation Explored: Insights into AI Applications in Financial Services and Housing\" to discuss the recent report's findings in more detail.", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_McHenry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick McHenry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_Waters", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maxine Waters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Financial_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Financial Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/US-House-Financial-Services-AI-finances-banking.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 525, "textEnd": 532}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 5372, "textEnd": 5379}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

In its first stab at policing the sector, the Taiwanese government focused on high-level regulations, including safety and data protection.\n\nThe National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) unveiled the draft proposals this week, with the public having until mid-September to submit feedback. NSTC is a cabinet-level agency of the Taiwanese government that focuses on research and development of science and emerging technology.\n\nOne key proposal is a national AI framework that would establish standards for labeling and disclosure from AI applications. This would promote safety and trustworthiness, which have been some of AI's biggest challenges.\n\nThe bill also delves into AI risk mitigation. However, it's also vague on this, proposing that the industry must be guided by clear rules to reduce risk for Taiwanese users. It drew parallels between its risk mitigation proposals and the AI Risk Management Framework, which the U.S. Department of Commerce established in 2023. This framework is just as vague, and most of its stipulations are voluntary, with authorities lacking any power to pursue violators.\n\nData privacy has been another significant challenge for AI. Taiwan's bill proposes that the country's data protection authorities be charged with ensuring AI firms don't unnecessarily collect, process, or use citizens' data to train their AI.\n\nAll these stipulations will only apply to AI applications that have been released to the public and will not impact projects under development or research to avoid stifling innovation.\n\nNSTC acknowledged that its framework is insufficient to cover all the aspects of AI. To remedy this, it proposes that the government establish a more comprehensive framework to police the industry. This framework would outline specifics, such as the application of AI in industries such as insurance and finance.\n\nThis framework should also ensure that AI can't be used to harm Taiwanese people or manipulate and mislead them. Bias, discrimination, false advertising, scams, and other harmful applications of AI must also be addressed.\n\nA recent survey found that local companies predict that AI automation could cost nearly a third of Taiwanese citizens' jobs. NSTC's bill calls on the government to protect these vulnerable workers and offer them guidance on transitioning to other jobs.\n\nWhile Taiwan's AI industry is nowhere close to the size of mainland China, the U.S., and other regional leaders, it remains a critical cog of the AI wheel. It's home to some of the largest producers of advanced chips -- led by TSMC -- with one report revealing that it accounts for 66% of the production of the world's most advanced chips.\n\nThe AI regulation headache\n\nTaiwan's approach of vague high-level AI regulations mirrors the approach of most other countries as the world struggles to oversee the emerging technology. Asian countries, in particular, have been lax with their AI laws to ensure local companies grow and compete with Western rivals.\n\nAs it has done with most technology, the EU has been the most aggressive in regulating AI. Its AI Act is the most comprehensive globally, but AI founders have expressed concerns that it could stifle innovation and push startups to other regions.\n\n\"The AI Act is a good idea but I worry that it will make it very hard for deep tech entrepreneurs to find success in Europe,\" says Andreas Cleve, whose AI health-tech startup Corti is based in Denmark.\n\nCleve told the Financial Times that compliance costs with the EU AI Act for a company of around 50 employees could run into six-figure sums.\n\n\"I worry about legislation that becomes hard to bear for a small company that can't afford it. It's a daunting task to raise cash and now you've had this tax imposed. You also need to spend time to understand it,\" he stated.\n\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership -- allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

The one-day conference, held at Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island, brought together AI experts, entrepreneurs, and business leaders to explore the latest developments in artificial intelligence and how organizations can harness its power.\n\nSteve Metcalfe, co-founder and CEO of Imagine AI Live\n\nIn his opening remarks, event organizer Steve Metcalfe noted that AI technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate and emphasized the urgency of AI adoption. \"One year in the world of AI is equivalent to 10 years in the past technology cycle,\" Metcalfe said. He urged attendees to approach the day with an open and imaginative mind to imagine new possibilities.\n\nCornell Tech Dean Greg Morrissette welcomed attendees and emphasized the campus' focus on AI research and innovation. Morrissette noted that Cornell Tech has launched more than 100 AI-focused startups in recent years, 94% of which remain in New York City. Morrissette emphasized that interdisciplinary collaboration is necessary to realize the promise and challenges of deploying AI tools in society.\n\nThe power of AI to transform industries\n\nSeveral speakers spoke about AI's potential to revolutionize different industries and business functions. Bindu Reddy, CEO of Abacus.AI, described how companies are rapidly moving through different stages of AI adoption. While many companies have started by giving employees access to general AI tools like ChatGPT, Reddy said the real productivity gains will come from building custom AI applications tailored to specific business needs.\n\nBindu Reddy, CEO, Abacus.AI\n\nShe highlighted the growing importance of AI agents that can autonomously execute complex business processes. \"For the first time in history, creators can scale their talents in the same way that tech companies can,\" Reddy noted. However, she cautioned that the cost of running advanced AI models remains high for many use cases, urging companies to think strategically about when to use cutting-edge models versus more affordable models.\n\nIgniteTech CEO Eric Vaughan spoke about his company's ambitious efforts to use AI to transform every aspect of business. He stressed the urgency of adopting AI, warning that companies that don't risk falling behind their competitors.\n\nEric Vaughn, CEO of Ignite Tech\n\nVaughan explained how IgniteTech dedicated every Monday throughout the quarter to AI projects and experiments. This \"AI Monday\" initiative was a big investment - 20% of salary - but Vaughan believes it was essential to drive change in the organization.\n\nVaughan also unveiled an interesting new technology called \"My Personas,\" which creates AI avatars of experts within a company. These avatars can hold natural conversations and use a knowledge base of experts to answer questions, while also being able to route complex inquiries to a real person when necessary.\n\nAI development and democratization of education\n\nMark Heaps of Groq\n\nSeveral speakers reiterated a key theme of making AI more accessible to developers and end users. Mark Heaps from Groq highlighted how his company's Language Processing Unit (LPU) technology enables lightning-fast AI inference, opening up new possibilities for real-time AI applications. He demonstrated a system that can transcribe audio, process it through an AI model, and generate a voice response in near real time.\n\nHeaps noted that Groq offers developers free access to spur innovation, and that more than 285,000 developers are currently building on its platform. \"We're trying to enable and empower developers,\" he said. \"We want to see what people do with it.\"\n\nNathaniel Whitmore, CEO of Superintelligent\n\nNathaniel Whittemore, CEO of Superintelligent, described their efforts to democratize AI education and help people understand how to effectively leverage AI tools. He countered recent claims that AI is overhyped, arguing that its rapid adoption by businesses and individuals proves its real-world value. He urged attendees to think beyond the obvious, noting that some of the most impactful applications of AI are \"small but important use cases that happen every day.\"\n\nEthical and human considerations\n\nWhile the excitement for AI's potential was clear, speakers also discussed the importance of always taking ethical considerations and human judgement into account. Futurist and entrepreneur Elatiah Abate emphasized that humans must remain the true agents of shaping AI's impact on society. She cautioned participants not to view AI with fear, but rather as a powerful tool that can augment human capabilities.\n\nElatiah Abate, Futurist and Entrepreneur\n\nAbate introduced the \"Think, Do, Be\" framework for approaching AI strategy and implementation. This holistic approach considers technical aspects and how organizations and individuals need to evolve the way they think and work. She emphasized the importance of having a clear purpose and intent when deploying AI technologies.\n\nChris Chang of Gradient AI discussed the complexities of customizing large language models for enterprise use cases. While fine-tuning a model is beneficial for certain domain-specific tasks, Chang emphasized that the new long-context models enable powerful customization by simply increasing the context during inference. This approach reduces technical debt compared to maintaining multiple fine-tuned models.\n\nImagine new possibilities\n\nThe event ended with attendees inspired by the potential of AI, but mindful of the need for responsible development. Speakers consistently emphasized that the AI revolution is still in its early stages, and its full impact is yet to be realized.\n\n\"We are co-creating the future with this technology,\" Abate reminded the audience. \"Who do you want to co-create with? Someone who is as empowered, enlightened, and excited about the future as you are?\"\n\nAs the conference demonstrated, the AI landscape is evolving at a dizzying pace. But even amidst rapid change, the human element remains crucial. By bringing together diverse perspectives and fostering open dialogue, events like Imagine AI Live play a key role in shaping a future where artificial intelligence truly enhances and augments human potential.\n\nImpact on the printing industry\n\nFor print company executives, insights shared at Imagine AI Live highlight the urgency of adopting AI technologies to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving market. Having already weathered significant disruption from digital technologies, the print industry is now facing both challenges and opportunities brought about by AI.\n\nOne key takeaway was the potential for AI to streamline and optimize various aspects of print production. As several speakers mentioned, AI can automate routine tasks, improve quality control, and increase overall operational efficiency. For example, AI-powered systems can optimize job scheduling, predict maintenance needs, and reduce waste in the printing process. This can result in significant cost savings and faster turnaround times for print jobs.\n\nAdditionally, advances in natural language processing and content generation demonstrated at the event suggest new possibilities for personalized print-on-demand services. Printing companies can leverage AI to offer their customers highly customized print products, from personalized marketing materials to bespoke publications that are generated in real time based on customer preferences and data inputs.\n\nThe discussion around AI-powered customer service and engagement is also promising for the printing industry: technologies such as the \"My Personas\" avatars introduced by Vaughan have the potential to revolutionize the way printers interact with customers, offering 24/7 expert support and streamlining the ordering and design process.\n\nBut print shop owners should also be mindful of the ethical and legal considerations raised at the event. As AI becomes more integrated into the creative process, issues around copyright, liability and data privacy will become increasingly important. Print shops will need to handle these issues carefully, especially when working with AI-generated content or using customer data to drive personalization.\n\nThe emphasis on AI education and democratization highlighted by speakers like Whitmore is especially relevant to the printing industry. Printing company owners must prioritize upskilling their employees to effectively leverage AI technology. This might include partnering with an AI education provider or developing in-house training programs to ensure employees at all levels can work with AI systems and maximize their benefits.\n\nUltimately, the message to print shop owners is clear: AI is not a future consideration, but a current reality that is reshaping entire industries. By proactively exploring and adopting AI technologies, print shops can stay at the forefront of innovation, unlock new revenue streams, and ensure their continued relevance in an increasingly digital world.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Tech", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornell Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Impact event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interdisciplinarity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roosevelt Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Roosevelt Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "End user"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Printing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://i.imgur.com/AoyxWyw.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 141, "textEnd": 148}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Many anticipated an AI Bill to be announced, but it was not mentioned. Instead, the speech focused on a legislative programme that looks at security, fairness, and opportunity.\n\nStability was described as the core of economic policy, with an emphasis on having tax and spending changes reviewed independently. \"My Government will legislate to ensure that all major tax and spending changes are subject to an independent assessment by the Office for Budget Responsibility,\" the King stated.\n\nThe speech also addressed initiatives to promote economic growth, improve infrastructure, and improve employment rights. Measures such as planning reform to speed up the delivery of infrastructure and housing, and introducing a new deal for working people to ban exploitative practices.\n\nThe King mentioned, \"My Government is committed to making work pay and will legislate to introduce a new deal for working people.\" Other important topics included clean energy transition, strengthening border security, and improving community policing.\n\nAlthough the AI Bill wasn't directly addressed, experts have shared their views on how AI should be managed and used going forward. Rightfully so, industry leaders want to see more when it comes to regulations surrounding the latest popular tech.\n\n\"While the King stopped short of naming a specific AI Bill, businesses nonetheless finally have the clarity they were urgently seeking as to whether the UK is going to legislate on AI. However, there is still a question mark on the how, which could likely take time to clarify and therefore still leave some uncertainty.\n\n\"Interestingly, the focus so far appears to be on large language models and general purpose AI, which therefore would make any legislation narrower than the EU AI Act given it focuses predominantly on AI use cases rather than the underlying technology itself.\n\n\"However, this also has the potential to create some contention between the UK and EU laws as they both look to wrangle with the opportunities and risk that general purpose AI presents.\"\n\nOn the new Digital Information and Smart Data Bill, which would enable new, \"innovative\" uses of data to help boost the economy, Rhiannon Webster, partner and head of UK data privacy at Ashurst, said:\n\n\"This is welcome news. The previous proposed data protection and digital information bill had been much criticised for simply tinkering around the edges of the UK GDPR with few benefits.\n\n\"However it did contain well received new data governance regimes which: (i) provide a framework for digital verification services; and (ii) pave the way for regulations impacting data access and governance beyond personal data. It would appear the new government has abandoned the previous approach of amending elements of the UK GDPR but retained the proposals regarding the new data governance regimes.\"\n\n\"Businesses must now brace for greater intervention and be prepared to demonstrate how they are protecting the integrity of AI systems and large language models. Developing robust foundations and controls for AI tools is a good starting point.\n\n\"Bad data could ultimately risk bad outcomes, so organisations need to have full transparency of the data used to train AI models. And just as importantly, businesses need to understand the decisions AI models are making and why.\n\n\"It's also critical that AI is designed, guided, and interpreted from a human perspective. For example, there needs to be careful consideration about whether large language models have been trained on bias-free, inclusive data or whether AI systems can account for a diverse range of emotional responses.\n\n\"These are important considerations that will help manage the wider social risks and implications it brings, allowing businesses to tackle some of the spikier challenges that generative AI poses so its transformative powers can be realised.\"\n\n\"This could give businesses guidance on how to prioritise trust and safety, introducing essential guard rails to ensure the safe development and usage of AI. This bill promises to go a long way in helping to tackle the risks that come from a lack of specialised knowledge around this relatively new technology.\n\n\"Our recent research showed 45% of IT professionals only have a basic understanding of GenAI technologies and most don't have governance frameworks in place for AI implementation. Introducing legislation on safety and control mechanisms, such as a requirement to protect the integrity of testing data, will help guide the use of AI so businesses can confidently use it to drive business growth.\n\n\"We also need closer collaboration between regulators, governments and industry to build a shared infrastructure - alongside the skills and security practices necessary to keep pace with the ever-evolving cyber security developments. This will offer the most robust defence and protection needed for our society moving forwards.\"\n\n\"Whilst tighter rules around frontier systems is sensible, Labour must guard against regulatory overreach.\n\n\"AI has been safely and successfully used for decades - from predicting travel times, spotting bank fraud, or reading patient scans.\n\n\"Embracing these \"narrow\" applications - AI tools with specific, predetermined goals set by humans - should be the priority. Cracking down here would only stifle growth and hamper innovation - as well as robbing the public of better, faster and cheaper public services.\n\n\"Starmer should release the handbrake on narrow AI, whilst implementing sensible rules around advanced, more general systems. This Bill looks to be a good start on that journey.\"\n\nBusinesses seem ready to include AI in their operations, if they haven't already started doing so, and so what's left is for proper regulation and policies that support responsible AI use for all.", "source": {"uri": "techround.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRound"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_from_the_throne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speech from the throne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Budget_Responsibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Office for Budget Responsibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Data Protection Regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Border control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Retirement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Retirement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://techround.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hulki-okan-tabak-PfBIETcXVPg-unsplash-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

However, there's actually a significant symbiotic relationship between extended reality, AI solutions, and machine learning.\n\nGenerative AI, in particular, is helping to accelerate development cycles in the XR world. It's helping companies to create more realistic, immersive environments and unique assets and enhancing the development of new XR hardware.\n\nThe rise of generative AI could help unlock new opportunities in the metaverse for all kinds of companies and end users and transform our immersive interactions. So, how do you choose the right extended reality AI software for your needs? Here's your step-by-step guide.\n\nStep 1: Consider Your Goals and Use Cases\n\nThe first step in comparing extended reality AI solutions is identifying your specific use cases and goals. The most common way companies leverage generative AI in extended reality is to streamline and support content development. Generative AI can create 3D content, assets, landscapes, and even non-playable characters (NPCs) for XR applications.\n\nCompanies like Snap and Meta even give developers access to generative AI tools that can reduce the time and effort involved in creating virtual experiences. However, there are various other ways companies can experiment with generative AI for XR.\n\nFor instance, generative AI solutions can be built into XR applications to give every user in an app access to a real-time coach, source of customer support, or coworker. For example, Copilot in Microsoft Mesh for Microsoft Teams can give each employee a real-time assistant to help them complete tasks.\n\nGenerative AI can also help generate digital twins of new products, ensuring teams can experiment with different ways to produce lighter and more comfortable virtual reality headsets or smart glasses.\n\nStep 2: Examine Extended Reality AI Integration Options\n\nIf you're using extended reality AI to streamline the development process or create content, integrations are essential. The best generative AI software should work seamlessly with the tools your teams already use, from content creation and development platforms like Unity and Unreal, to metaverse as a service platforms.\n\nThe ability to access AI alongside crucial CAD tools, software development kits, and even project management and analytical tools will help to enhance your workflows and boost productivity. If you're using generative AI as a feature in an extended reality app, it's important to ensure the technology you access can work seamlessly with the hardware your end users prefer.\n\nFor instance, you might want to ensure your app will work well on a device like the Apple Vision Pro, leveraging spatial computing features and gesture or voice recognition to improve user experiences. Your technology might need to integrate with certain solutions to enable specific capabilities. For instance, if your customers use generative AI to create realistic avatars, your tech will need to integrate with facial scanning tools.\n\nStep 3: Prioritize Advanced AI Functionality\n\nTo take full advantage of extended reality AI, companies need access to the most advanced algorithms. Simple solutions like ChatGPT might help you create scripts and basic images for your XR applications. However, more advanced toolkits can assist with various aspects of the development process. For instance, Nvidia's generative AI solutions can rapidly produce digital twins, or leverage perception algorithms for spatial mapping, object recognition, and more.\n\nVirtualSpeech's generative AI solutions can enable speech-to-text capabilities and learn over time to adapt training experiences to the needs of different users. Many generative AI solutions also offer exceptional customization options. They can adapt to serve users in different languages, speak in a specific tone of voice, or match the personality of a certain brand.\n\nSome solutions even combine generative AI capabilities with other forms of artificial intelligence, such as conversational AI, or computer vision. Prioritize advanced features based on the specific use cases and goals you have for generative AI in XR.\n\nStep 4: Consider Security and Compliance\n\nSecurity and compliance are two major concerns for anyone investing in extended reality AI. Whether you're purchasing a pre-built generative AI app for your team to use in virtual or augmented reality applications or building something new with gen AI, security is key.\n\nLike most forms of AI, generative AI relies heavily on large volumes of data. This makes it crucial to ensure the software you're using stores and collects data according to compliance standards. If you're investing in an AI app for extended reality or you're building a new metaverse environment with AI, make sure your data will be encrypted and protected.\n\nIt's also worth considering how you can ensure your AI solution is ethical. Generative AI can create synthetic data that gives companies access to broader, more diverse data sets they can use to create highly accessible and user-friendly applications and tools. This can also allow for the creation of more ethical AI assistants for use in training and customer service.\n\nStep 5: Look for Scalable Extended Reality AI\n\nFinally, whenever you invest in extended reality AI for any purpose, you'll have the ability to scale your solution as your business grows. If you're purchasing generative AI applications for your team, you must ensure the solution can scale to support as many team members as possible. Ensure it works in various languages and is easily accessible on various devices, from smart glasses to mixed reality headsets like the Apple Vision Pro.\n\nIf you're using generative AI for content development, make sure you can train and fine-tune your solution with proprietary data and insights. Look for machine-learning capabilities that will make your technology more efficient and effective over time.\n\nAdditionally, ensure you can add to the functionality of your generative AI system over time by integrating additional applications and software with the technology or customizing certain elements. This will help you get the most value out of your technology.\n\nComparing Extended Reality AI Solutions\n\nAI and extended reality are a match made in heaven. Whether you're looking for ways to get more value out of your immersive collaboration apps with an AI assistant or you want to accelerate your product development lifecycle, generative AI can help.\n\nThe key to choosing the right solution is identifying your specific use case and examining the available technology carefully to ensure your technology is secure, scalable, and innovative.", "source": {"uri": "xrtoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "XR Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebekah_carter@xrtoday.com", "name": "Rebekah Carter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extended reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Non-player character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Teams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Teams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speech recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unreal Engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unity (game engine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software development kit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Companies", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.xrtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/How-to-Compare-Extended-Reality-AI-Solutions-XR-Today-News.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Foster: How AI can help family law attorneys", "body": "We have all heard that artificial intelligence is revolutionizing various sectors, and the legal industry is no exception. Several months ago, I knew nothing about and felt intimidated by AI - but using AI is easier and more intuitive than you think.\n\nHere are a few ways AI can assist family law attorneys in enhancing their practice and providing better service to their clients.\n\nHelping clients communicate\n\nWe are all familiar with the phenomenon when your case is going along smoothly (all in accordance with your well-developed strategy) and then your client sends his ex a zinger by text and you feel as if all of the air was suddenly let out of the balloon.\n\nClients can be their own worst enemies ... and most clients do not want to pay you to review every outgoing correspondence. AI can provide a solution. Clients can use AI to \"scrub\" or edit their outgoing communication -- keeping them in compliance with your case strategy (and improving co-parenting relationships).\n\nFor example, clients can type into an AI tool: \"How can I ask my witch of an ex to stop showing up late to the damn custody exchanges.\" AI tools will retype the message using civil and neutral language.\n\nI often advise clients to ask AI tools to draft a message using William Eddy's \"BIFF\" communication guidelines for parents in high-conflict cases. (BIFF stands for \"brief, informative, friendly & firm\" as featured in Eddy's book, \"Quick Responses to High-Conflict People, Their Personal Attacks, Hostile Email and Social Media Meltdown. )\" This can keep your case on track without running up a prohibitive bill.\n\nResearch and document review\n\nAI can significantly streamline the labor-intensive task of legal research and document review. AI-powered tools can expedite the usually time-consuming task of sifting through case law, statutes, and legal precedents by quickly analyzing vast amounts of legal data and identifying relevant information.\n\nFor instance, AI algorithms can scan documents for pertinent legal issues and suggest applicable precedents, saving attorneys time and reducing the likelihood of human error.\n\nAdministrative tasks\n\nFamily law attorneys (who are more likely to be solo practitioners or at smaller firms) often juggle numerous administrative tasks that consume valuable time. AI can automate many of these routine tasks, such as scheduling meetings, managing client communications, and generating standard legal documents like basic divorce pleadings and parenting plans.\n\nIt's possible to ask your favorite AI tool to draft something in compliance with Maryland Law (or to track the language of a particular statute). In most AI tools, you can also upload your forms so that the tool will use your own language as the basis for certain agreements.\n\nAI tools are fairly well equipped to perform many tasks historically assigned to paralegals or administrative staff. Tools like \"chatbots\" can handle initial client queries and gather essential information, allowing attorneys to focus on more complex aspects of their cases.\n\nDecision making and settlement analysis\n\nAI can aid attorneys in making more informed decisions by providing comprehensive data analysis and scenario planning. For example, in divorce cases involving complex asset division, AI can analyze financial data to suggest equitable distribution strategies. Similarly, in custody cases, AI can assess various factors to recommend arrangements that serve the best interests of the children involved.\n\nAI can quickly generate various alternative custody calendars or reduce a spousal support award to present value. These tools can even be used \"in real time\" during client meetings (or mediation) to analyze certain settlement scenarios.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile AI offers numerous benefits, of course human judgment and ethical standards remain paramount in making final decisions and providing compassionate legal counsel. There are many ways AI can increase the value family law attorneys are able to provide relative to the cost of the case - especially when AI is used under the supervision of our collective professional experience.\n\nAI will never replace our legal judgment, but clients will get more bang-for-their-buck if we can learn how to effectively leverage AI to improve efficiencies in our practice.\n\nAI is transforming the landscape of family law by enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and client satisfaction. Practitioners who are able to leverage AI effectively will provide greater value to their clients, even handling larger caseloads (and cutting overhead expenses) in order to improve profitability.\n\nAs AI technologies continue to evolve, their integration into family law practices will likely become increasingly essential.

In total, there are four levels of risk:\n\n(1) unacceptable, in which case AI systems are prohibited (see our blog post);\n\n(2) high risk, in which case AI systems are subject to extensive requirements, including regarding transparency;\n\n(3) limited risk, which triggers only transparency requirements (see our blog post); and\n\n(4) minimal risk, which does not trigger any obligations.\n\nIdentifying High-Risk AI Systems\n\nArticle 6 of the AI Act describes the thresholds that lead to an AI system being \"high risk.\" Either such system meets the criteria in Article 6(1) of the AI Act or it falls into a category referred to in Article 6(2) of the AI Act.\n\nArticle 6(1) of the AI Act. An AI system will be considered high risk if two cumulative conditions are fulfilled:\n\n1. The AI system is intended to be used as a safety component of a product (or is a product) covered by specific EU harmonization legislation listed in Annex I of the AI Act. This list contains more than 30 directives and regulations, including legislation regarding the safety of toys, vehicles, civil aviation, lifts, radio equipment and medical devices; and\n\n2. The same harmonization legislation mandates that the product that incorporates the AI system as a safety component, or the AI system itself as a stand-alone product, undergo a third-party conformity assessment before being placed on the EU market or put into service within the EU.\n\nArticle 6(2) of the AI Act -- Specific List. In addition, the AI Act contains, in its Annex III, a list of AI systems that must be considered high risk. This list currently contains AI systems in eight different categories. Examples include, subject to specific conditions and exemptions, biometrics, critical infrastructures, education and vocational training, employment, worker management, and access to self-employment. The European Commission (Commission) has the power to amend this list.\n\nThe AI systems identified in Annex III will not be considered high risk if they do not pose a significant risk of harm to individuals' health, safety or fundamental rights, including by not materially influencing the outcome of decision-making. This exemption applies where one of the following conditions is met:\n\nHowever, the exemption never applies if the AI system performs profiling of natural persons. Profiling is defined by reference to Article 4(4) of the General Data Protection Regulation as any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location or movements.\n\nIf a provider considers that an AI system benefits from the exemption, it must document its assessment before placing that system or putting it into service in the European Union. The provider must also register the system in an EU database for high-risk AI systems set up and maintained by the Commission.\n\nThe Commission will provide guidelines no later than 18 months from the date of entry into force of the AI Act to specify the practical implementation of classification rules for high-risk AI systems, including the conditions for exceptions.\n\nRequirements for High-Risk AI Systems\n\nHigh-risk AI systems must comply with a significant number of requirements considering their intended purposes, the generally acknowledged state of the art and the risk management system put in place.

However, he added he's seen \"positive indications\" about Labour's plans for AI so far.\n\nLegislation on AI would mark a contrast with Starmer's predecessor. Under ex-PM Rishi Sunak, the government had opted for a light-touch approach to AI, seeking instead to apply existing rules to the technology.\n\nThe previous Conservative government said in a February policy paper that introducing binding measures too soon could \"fail to effectively address risks, quickly become out of date, or stifle innovation.\"\n\nIn February, the U.K.'s new technology minister, Peter Kyle said Labour would make it compulsory on a statutory basis for companies to share test data on the safety of their AI models with government.\n\n\"We would compel by law, those test data results to be released to the government,\" Kyle, then shadow tech minister, said in an interview with the BBC at the time.\n\nSunak's government had secured agreements from tech firms to share safety testing information with the AI Safety Institute, a state-backed body testing advanced AI systems. But this was only done on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe U.K. government wants to avoid pushing too hard with AI rules to the extent that it ends up hampering innovation. Labour also flagged in its manifesto that it wants to \"support diverse business models which bring innovation and new products to the market.\"\n\nAny regulation would need to be \"nuanced,\" assigning responsibilities \"accordingly,\" Zahra Bahrololoumi, CEO of U.K. and Ireland at Salesforce, told CNBC, adding that she welcomes the governments call for \"appropriate legislation.\"\n\nMatthew Houlihan, senior director of government affairs at Cisco, said any AI rules would need to be \"centered on a thoughtful, risk-based approach.\"\n\nOther proposals that have already been put forward by U.K. politicians offer some insight as to what might be included in Labour's AI Bill.\n\nBritish lawmaker Chris Holmes, a Conservative backbencher who sits in the upper house of parliament, last year introduced a bill proposing to regulate AI. The bill passed its third reading in May, kicking it over to the lower house of Parliament.\n\nHolmes' law would have less of a chance at succeeding than one put forward by the government. However, it offers some ideas for how Labour could look to form its own AI legislation.\n\nHolmes' proposed bill includes the suggestion for the creation of a centralized AI authority, which would oversee the enforcement of rules for the technology.\n\nCompanies would have to supply the AI Authority with third-party data and intellectual property used in the training of their models and ensure that any such data and IP is used with consent from the original source.\n\nThis echoes, in some ways, the EU's AI Office, which is responsible for supervising the development of AI advanced models.\n\nAnother proposal from Holmes is for firms to appoint individual AI officers, which would be tasked with ensuring safe, ethical and unbiased uses of AI by businesses, as well as making sure data used in any AI technology is unbiased.\n\nBased on what Labour has promised so far, any such law will inevitably be \"a very long way from the far-reaching scope of the EU AI Act,\" Matthew Holman, partner at law firm Cripps, told CNBC.\n\nHolman added that rather than require overbearing disclosures from AI model makers, the U.K. is more likely to find a \"middle ground\". For example, the government could require AI firms to share what they're working on with closed-door sessions of the AI Safety Institute, but without revealing trade secrets or source code.\n\nTech minister Kyle said previously at London Tech Week that Labour wouldn't pass a law as stringent as the AI Act because it doesn't want to hinder innovation or deter investment from large AI developers.\n\nEven so, a U.K. AI law would be a step above the U.S., which currently doesn't have federal AI legislation of any kind. In China, meanwhile, regulation is stricter than both the EU, and any legislation the U.K. is likely to put forward.\n\nLast year, Chinese regulators finalized rules governing generative AI aimed at stamping out illegal content and boosting security protections.\n\nSirion's Liu said one thing he's hoping the government doesn't do, is restrict open-source AI models. \"It's essential that the U.K.'s new AI regulations don't stifle open source or fall into the trap of regulatory capture,\" he told CNBC.\n\n\"There's a massive difference between the harm created by a large LLM from the likes of OpenAI and specific tailored open source models used by a start up to solve a specific problem.\"\n\nHerman Narula, CEO of metaverse venture builder Improbable, agreed that restricting open-source AI innovation would be a bad idea. \"New government action is needed but this action must focus on creating a viable world for open-source AI companies, which are necessary to prevent monopolies,\" Narula told CNBC.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person",

After years of uncertainty over the impact of digital technology and productivity, large businesses in the UK could save up to 7.9 billion employee hours through the use of AI.\n\nIndividual business leaders could save 1,117 hours per year through the use of AI if it was used to its full potential, equivalent to 140 working days annually, while individual employees could save 737 hours each year, the equivalent of 92 working days.\n\nThe study also found that team motivation must be prioritised, with low enagement hammering productivity even if AI is adopted. Unengaged employees are the biggest barrier to productivity, the study claims. With its potential to take on mundane, repetitive tasks, AI could empower everyone to focus on more meaningful and impactful work.\n\nFurther, overcoming barriers in trust is going to be essential for AI adoption. 93% of both employees and leaders have concerns relating to trust in AI today, according to the report.\n\n\"Sizeable productivity growth has eluded UK workplaces for over 15 years - but responsible AI has the potential to shift the paradigm,\" said Daniel Pell, vice president and country manager, UKI, Workday.\n\n\"However, AI can only reach its full potential if it is trusted and aligned to business outcomes, which is why Workday AI solutions are designed with transparency, explainability, and reliability from the start.\n\n\"We encourage businesses to take a two-pronged approach when it comes to deploying AI: a concrete analysis of the efficiencies AI can drive, alongside a transparent strategy to tackle the material and cultural barriers to its adoption. As this report reveals, for those that get it right, the results can be transformative for growth.\"\n\nIn an 8-hour workday, the study found employees and business leaders being genuinely productive for 5.8 and 5.9 hours respectively, leaving over a quarter of the day unproductive and not generating business value.\n\nWith these lost hours in mind, the role of AI becomes clear. When asked about how much time they expect to save if AI was used to its full potential, both employees and business leaders are bullish. Employees claim 2.9 hours could be saved each day with business leaders predicting almost double this at 4.4 hours.\n\nAn additional 2.9 hours of work per day is the equivalent of \u00a311,058 a year of added work for each average employee, based on salaries reported. With over 10 million employees in large businesses across the UK, \u00a3119 billion worth of productive work each year could be untapped across UK large enterprises through the use of AI.\n\nRemoving Barriers to AI Adoption to Meet Productivity Desires\n\nWhile AI's potential to transform productivity is clear, barriers to adoption remain. According to leaders, the largest concerns they feel delaying their organisation's progress in AI are: fears over safety/privacy/bias (38%), needing more time to educate teams (34%) and lack of investment (32%).\n\nThese fears and concerns must be overcome in addition to the following obstacles which the data shows are harming organisation's productivity: unengaged employees (41%), lack of incentives (41%), and inadequate technology (35%).\n\nOf particular concern is the issue of trust in AI, with 93% of both employees and leaders having concerns relating to trust in AI.

The study gleaned its data from a pool of over 2,500 executives at the intersection of AI and manufacturing to reach its findings, noting that AI spending in the ecosystem is down by double-digit percentages since the start of the year.\n\nPer the report, 36% of surveyed respondents are keen on keeping AI spending flat as they scan the horizons for favorable metrics before increasing investments. Compared to 2023, only 6% of executives expressed hesitancy toward increasing the size of their AI bets, highlighting a massive decline in interest.\n\nThe waning interest in the segment is not far-fetched. The respondents expressed their worries over the perceived risks associated with generative AI models. 44% of respondents say concerns around the response accuracy of AI models are a major factor in their decision to stall the integration of the technology.\n\nSince launch, AI models have grappled with the existential problem of hallucination, skewing the accuracy of responses and diminishing user trust levels. While several researchers have made significant strides in solving AI's hallucination problems, analysts say the issue may be here for the long term.\n\nAccording to Lucidworks' study, implementation cost for AI systems is another reason for manufacturers' slow pace of adoption. Apart from the steep cost of an infrastructure overhaul, companies in the vertical will have to fork out a fortune to train employees on the latest AI models.\n\nOutside of costs, 3% of manufacturing firms are uncertain about turning to AI over fears of job displacement of their employees. Entry-level customer service and design roles face the most risk of replacement by generative AI systems, with upskilling failing to cater to the challenge.\n\n\"While many manufacturers see the potential benefits of generative AI, challenges such as response accuracy and cost are causing them to take a more cautious approach,\" said Lucidwoks CEO Mike Sinoway. \"This is reflected in spending plans, with significantly fewer planning to increase AI investments compared to last year.\"\n\nFinding a balance\n\nDespite the fears expressed by manufacturing companies, Lucidworks' study highlighted the upsides of finding a healthy balance with AI, pointing to the general \"above-average cost benefits\" in the long term.\n\nFirms in the vertical can improve their design optimization with generative AI at a pace beyond human capabilities while advancing predictive maintenance abilities for companies. Other perks include seamless integration with other emerging technologies, quality control, improved customization, and energy efficiency.\n\n\"B2B companies and manufacturers have much to gain if they can balance cost and risk to improve efficiency, enhance the buyer experience, and reduce operational costs using generative AI,\" said Sinoway.\n\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership -- allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

As frequently reported, it will then enter into force twenty days later, i.e. on August 1, 2024.\n\nHowever, the question of who is responsible for the general market surveillance of the enforcement of the AI Regulation is still open.\n\nThere is of course the EU AI Office (European Office for Artificial Intelligence), which was established by Commission decision in January 2024 - i.e. before the adoption of the AI Regulation. This EU AI Office is to perform a number of key tasks as part of the EU's AI strategy and is to become the center of the EU's AI expertise. In addition, the EU AI Office is responsible for the regulation of general purpose AI models (GPAI models) and AI systems based on a GPAI model and developed by the same provider.\n\nBut the national authorities of the Member States are responsible for enforcement measures in relation to AI systems that are not GPAI models or that have not been developed directly by the provider itself from GPAI models. This topic is regulated in Article 70 of the AI Act. This stipulates that each EU Member State must maintain at least one notification authority and at least one market surveillance authority to enforce the AI Act.\n\nYesterday (17 Juli 2024), following their last plenary meeting, all European data protection authorities have expressly asked for this role as market surveillance authority through the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). The original statement was issued in March 2024 and was adopted at yesterday's meeting. The German Data Protection Conference also reaffirmed this position in May 2024.\n\nEDPB Vice-Chair Irene Loizidou Nicolaidou said yesterday: \"Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) should play an important role in enforcing the AI Act, as most AI systems involve the processing of personal data. I strongly believe that DPAs are suitable for this role due to their complete independence and their comprehensive understanding of the risks of AI for fundamental rights, based on their previous experience.\"\n\nIt is already certain that data protection supervisory authorities will be entrusted with market surveillance for the largest parts of the high-risk catalog of AI systems (AI in law enforcement, administration of justice, migration control and AI that influences elections). It is interesting to note that this applies not only to authorities that use such AI systems, but also to commercial enterprises such as software providers, cloud services or security companies that offer AI systems for these areas. The competence for surveillance affects the entire value chain in this context.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nBy August 2, 2025, all member states must adopt an implementing law for the AI Regulation. A key issue here will be who will then be appointed as the general market surveillance authority.\n\nPractical relevance\n\nFrom our many years of practical experience with data protection supervisory authorities, we can welcome such a role. From our point of view, it is a clear advantage for our clients in all respects, whether they are small, medium-sized or large companies, if they then also have to deal with a \"known\" authority with regard to AI systems. We know from experience what the data protection authorities attach particular importance to and can provide companies with even better support in implementing the AI Regulation. This bundling of audits at the data protection supervisory authorities would also be very helpful with regard to both the GDPR and the AI Regulation, as the authority - just like the companies - would then have to consider both areas of law and the implementation of practical processes. This could prevent the risk of silos arising in the sense of a mental separation between \"data protection\" and \"AI governance\", which would be rather impractical.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_surveillance_(products)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market surveillance (products)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Journal_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official Journal of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Data_Protection_Board", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Data Protection Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "German language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Data Protection Regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-07-", "textStart": 19, "textEnd": 26}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

You can also hear his insights on TECHtonic: Trends in Technology and Services.\n\nThe facts are clear: Artificial intelligence has unquestionably disrupted multiple industries around the world. Business leaders everywhere are scrambling to assess how AI will impact their fields as well as the steps they need to take to put their companies on the path to success.\n\nToday, those same companies are navigating a concept we refer to as the \"Black Box of Operationalizing AI.\" This overarching concept is centrally defined by three questions:\n\n1. What AI use cases drive the greatest ROI?\n\n2. How long will it take for AI to disrupt my industry?\n\n3. What factors slow down the implementation and use of AI?\n\nThese are daunting -- and complex -- questions to answer, to be sure.\n\nAs of current writing, our research and modeling conservatively predict that AI will reduce the headcount requirements of technology companies by 20% to manage the same revenues. However, the impact could be much more dramatic in the end. This doesn't mean successful technology companies will suddenly start shrinking their employee base; it just means they will be able to grow revenues with the same or fewer employees.\n\nArmed with the knowledge that AI is disrupting businesses everywhere and faced with the realities of reducing headcount, the next logical question for most leaders becomes how they can leverage AI today. It's this question that is creating a rapidly growing need for success stories and case studies demonstrating the ways that early adopters are finding success with AI.\n\nOne of the earliest business functions to find success with AI adoption has been education services. We see numerous companies already actively leveraging AI in this space, and it's providing a significant benefit.\n\nTransforming unstructured information into usable content has long been a time-consuming process for education services organizations. However, with the rise of AI, companies are now able to tackle that task much more quickly.\n\nThe team at OpenText shared a vivid illustration of AI's early successes on my TECHtonic podcast. With a wealth of valuable unstructured content such as standard operating procedures, case studies and text-based content, the team found itself challenged to efficiently reuse and structure this content to accelerate the development of e-learning materials.\n\nThe product's subject matter experts were actively developing content, but they frequently encountered stumbling blocks in structuring it for a broader audience. Unfortunately, this led to greater inefficiencies in the creation process, which OpenText then set out to address comprehensively.\n\nIn collaboration with LearnExperts AI, the OpenText team developed the ability to input content in diverse formats -- including decks, PowerPoints, MP3s and white papers. Leveraging this system, course outlines were swiftly generated, content was modularized and valuable recommendations were provided through the learning advisor feature. This innovative approach not only saved time but also tackled the challenge of enhancing the scalability and efficiency of OpenText's content creation.\n\nOpenText then used another AI tool called DeepL, which enabled its team to input scripts for translation using the same script as the text-to-speech source. By leveraging one script, the team could subsequently address multiple use cases, eliminating a number of redundancies for content designers and e-learning developers. The result of these projects was a 65% to 70% increase in the speed of content creation.\n\nThese examples demonstrate undeniable early wins for AI in a business setting, but it's not always as simple as it may seem. Altering a business model like this in such a fundamental way always creates significant challenges when it comes to change management.\n\nOne common mistake companies are already making is intrinsically connected to their approach to the leadership of their AI strategy. The adoption of AI for any business needs to be built from a centralized strategy that encompasses the business -- meaning that a member of the senior leadership team must drive this strategy from the top.\n\nFor AI to run as intended, it requires vast amounts of data. Therefore, leveraging clean, centralized datasets is essential to improving AI functionality. However, few companies have enormous, centralized datasets on hand. This makes successful AI implementation even more of a company-wide effort, requiring the direct attention of senior leaders at every step of deployment.\n\nOver the past few decades, pop culture and media speculation have established a set of preconceived beliefs when it comes to AI. One of the most prevalent is that machines will replace people. With the added efficiencies that AI can lend to businesses, it may very well seem like that for many at the outset. However, what we're really going to experience, rather than a \"great replacement,\" is a period where the role of human beings in business intrinsically changes.\n\nEmployees have to understand that AI is unquestionably going to change the nature of the jobs in their company. However, change isn't necessarily bad -- it also means new opportunities are going to emerge. As such, businesses need to establish strong change management principles to help their team members understand that AI is a tool like any other. However, its potential to help them evolve and perform a more valuable role for the company is nearly limitless.\n\nAI is already fundamentally altering the way business is done, and it's no overstatement to say that nearly every industry will be impacted.

Why I Think Generative AI Would Be Bad for Gaming Are There Any Upsides? Key Takeaways Generative AI in gaming can improve graphics, audio, and procedural generation, but may lead to significant job losses in the industry. Automated creativity from AI may lack the human touch found in unique, diverse games. Open-ended content generated by AI could be offensive or inappropriate, raising concerns about auditing and accountability.\n\nArtificial intelligence has made a big impact on most creative fields in recent years. While the possibilities are vast, we should be careful to ensure all these rapid changes are beneficial.\n\nWhat Is Generative AI and How Can Games Use It?\n\nGenerative AI is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the programmatic generation of content like images, music, and more.\n\nWhen it comes to video gaming, the sky's the limit for generative AI. Just some of the areas that this new technology may touch on include:\n\nGraphics, including background scenes, 3d textures, and character sprites or models. Audio assets from sound effects to complete music scores. Textual artifacts like narration, speech dialogue, and descriptive prose. Maps and procedural generation. Why I Think Generative AI Would Be Bad for Gaming\n\nGenerative AI is a fun field with some brilliant people working in it. But I fear there are enough downsides for gaming that we should be wary of.\n\nIndustry Job Losses\n\nWhatever ethical or legal dilemmas surround AI, most people agree on one outcome: jobs in certain roles will be lost. Maybe current artists have to retrain, and maybe new disciplines arise, but the goal of generative AI is to make some tasks easier and faster, and job losses are an inevitability.\n\nCertain jobs are bound to rise up, then fall out of fashion as the progress of technology marches on. But losses at scale, in a short period, will impact individuals and the wider industry. 2023 and 2024 have been terrible years for the gaming industry, with at least 20,000 job losses so far.\n\nAutomation Devalues Creativity\n\nAlthough artists can benefit from generative AI, it's pretty clear that we lose something if we remove the human element from artistic productions. Could an AI ever replicate the creativity inherent in bizarre games like Baba Is You, the humor and satire in a game like The Stanley Parable, or the mind-bending psychedelic twists of Super Mario Wonder?\n\nMuch of the visual AI art we've seen so far has been of a similar style, an unreal, uncanny valley of AI slop. As someone who grew up observing huge progress in graphical power, I've noticed how much more varied gaming has become as an art form. AI threatens to turn the dial back.\n\nOpen-Ended Content May Be Offensive or Unsuitable for the Audience\n\nHow can you audit your content when you don't know quite what it may be at launch? If your generative AI has too much agency, it may start using words you don't like or creating imagery that is inappropriate for your audience. AI can be biased, so it may end up offending the audience or creating games that are lacking in diversity.\n\nThere have been many cases of AI going rogue, using rude language or bigoted words. Some of the issues surrounding the safety of self-driving cars apply here; if an AI creates undesirable content, who exactly is to blame?\n\nIs AI Just Another Bandwagon?\n\nWhile gaming at its best can be innovative, it has quite a conservative tendency to latch onto a singular idea. We've suffered microtransactions, fallen victim to scam NFT games, and heard countless claims about crypto in gaming that have failed to deliver.\n\nEach of these much-hyped technologies has seen companies falling over themselves to be involved, often without asking why they should. I'm concerned that companies aren't listening to what gamers actually want and, instead, are simply rushing to introduce AI for the sake of it.\n\nAre There Any Upsides?\n\nI can see some valid uses for AI in gaming. Such cases would provide a clear tangible benefit and wouldn't threaten existing jobs or creativity.\n\nFor example, an AI could act as a translator for player names, generating audio dialogue dynamically. This would be impractical any other way than programmatically, and would probably require some form of AI to pronounce any name realistically.\n\nThis is a small niche, though. There are enough concerns that I think we should go lightly, at a slower pace than I fear we already are.", "source": {"uri": "makeuseof.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MakeUseOf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Procedural generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sound effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texture mapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprite (computer graphics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_art", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Is_You", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baba Is You"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Mario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stanley_Parable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Stanley Parable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheet music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-fungible token"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/a-person-using-an-arcade-machine-that-is-connected-to-a-robot-on-the-other-side-of-the-wall.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

These disruptions underscore the need for robust guardrails to ensure that our increasing dependence on AI does not compromise essential services and human safety in the future.\n\nToday the world woke up to a massive IT outage, driven by a patch update from security company CrowdStrike, which in turn led to a widespread blue screen issue on Windows-operated computers. This disruption affected multiple industries worldwide, highlighting the risks of relying on a single technology for mission-critical operations. The outage, one of the largest in recent history, has grounded planes in the US, halted trains in the UK, and left TV stations unable to broadcast. The full magnitude of the issue will probably not be known for days. This should prompt businesses, government institutions, and especially tech companies to reconsider their dependence on single providers and explore strategies to enhance their operational resilience.\n\nThe incident serves as a crucial lesson in the interconnected nature of modern business technology. Major cloud and Software as a Service (SaaS) providers, while offering significant benefits, also introduce risks of single points of failure. We have seen this in the past with cybersecurity outages caused by SolarWinds and Kaseya. When multiple companies depend on the same critical infrastructure, a disruption can cascade across various sectors, halting operations and causing widespread chaos, as we saw today.\n\nAs AI technology continues to advance, the potential for overreliance becomes a pressing concern. Overreliance on AI occurs when users start accepting AI outputs without sufficient scrutiny, leading to errors and a loss of trust in AI systems. This can be particularly dangerous in fields requiring precise and critical decision-making, such as healthcare, air transport, military use, judicial oversight, and more.\n\nConsider the scenario of an emergency heart or brain surgery scheduled based on AI-driven systems. If the underlying technology fails due to a patch update from CrowdStrike or another company in the software supply chain, such as a machine not rebooting correctly, the consequences could be fatal. In military use, AI systems could make decisions to launch attacks or be slow to counter-strike without human intervention, leading to catastrophic outcomes in either scenario. Similarly, a judge over-relying on AI to interpret the law and issue a ruling without proper oversight could result in grave injustices. These are only a few examples of what overreliance on AI could mean.\n\nEnsuring appropriate guardrails and safeguards on not over-relying on AI use is essential to prevent such catastrophic outcomes.\n\nOne of the primary goals of AI system design should be to empower users to develop appropriate reliance on AI, with robust human oversight. This is critical as a few wise policymakers and practitioners call for greater human involvement to act as the final safeguard against AI failures. These calls need to be joined by industry luminaries to show they are responsible citizens, and not just driven by greed and technological wizardry. Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, and other leading CEOs should join in a pact where AI development is not inadvertently stunting human growth.\n\nWhile AI offers numerous benefits, such as enhanced information processing and improved decision-making, it cannot replace human emotional nuance, critical thinking, and ethical considerations. AI overreliance leads to multiple biases, including confirmation bias and the overestimation of AI explanations. Our biggest fear should be when people stop learning how to think and over-rely on AI outputs. What happens when there is an outage? Will the surgeon not know how to operate to save a life? Will the air traffic controller forget how to help flights land safely without AI-driven technology? Over-reliance on AI can lead to vulnerabilities, ethical dilemmas, and a decline in personal growth, thinking skills, and learning opportunities.\n\nThe recent global outage and growing AI integration into daily operations highlight the urgent need for balanced technology strategies guided by proven and solid principles that have withstood the tests of time. Businesses must diversify their technology dependencies, implement robust contingency plans, and ensure strong human oversight of AI and technology systems.\n\nAI and technology in general should be viewed as tools to augment human capabilities, not replace them. By striking the right balance, we can harness the power of AI while safeguarding against its potential risks, ensuring that technology serves humanity without compromising safety and reliability.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CrowdStrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_key", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chroma key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_critical", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mission critical"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolarWinds", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SolarWinds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single point of failure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Critical infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software as a service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neurosurgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sundar Pichai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science_and_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science and Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Assistive_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Assistive Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/669a616906e85841f3934ba0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=671,377,x0,y12,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Zhou played a pivotal role in their development, joining Alibaba in 2017 after graduating with a PhD in computer software and theories from Peking University. He also contributed significantly to the multimodal AI model M6 released in 2021.\n\nRelated Article: Alibaba Founder Jack Ma Returns to the Spotlight, Encourages Staff to Seize 'AI Opportunity'\n\nZhou's departure coincides with China's booming AI startup scene, often referred to as the rise of the \"AI tigers,\" as The South China Morning Post reports. These startups, including Baichuan, Zhipu AI, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax, have attracted significant investments, each raising billions of dollars. This flourishing ecosystem is proving to be a magnet for top AI talent seeking new challenges and potentially lucrative opportunities.\n\nWhile Alibaba laments the loss of an AI specialist like Zhou, the company remains actively involved in China's AI future. Alibaba has emerged as a leading investor in the very \"AI tiger\" startups attracting top talent away.\n\nThe company has backed all four major players: Baichuan, Moonshot AI, Zhipu AI, and MiniMax. This dual approach - nurturing in-house talent while investing in the broader ecosystem - highlights the complex and dynamic nature of China's AI race.\n\nThe trend of AI specialists leaving established companies extends beyond Alibaba. ByteDance, the owner of social media giants TikTok and Douyin, has also witnessed the departure of key AI personnel.\n\nYang Hongxia, previously involved in LLM research at ByteDance, recently left to pursue her own AI endeavors. Similarly, Kuaishou Technology, a rival of ByteDance, saw its LLM project leader Fu Ruiji depart to embark on his own AI startup venture.\n\nThese departures signify a significant moment for China's AI landscape. The exodus of top talent from established players coupled with the rise of well-funded startups indicates a growing focus on innovation and competition within the field.\n\nAlibaba proves that it can even use AI to draw shoppers, The Wall Street Journal writes in another report.

Its focus is mitigating consumer harm and discrimination by AI systems, and Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said he hopes the conversations will continue on the state and federal level.\n\nOther states, like New Mexico, have focused on regulating how computer generated images can appear in media and political campaigns. Some, like Iowa, have criminalized sexually charged computer-generated images, especially when they portray children.\n\n\"We can't just sit and wait,\" Delaware state Rep. Krista Griffith, D-Wilmington, who has sponsored AI regulation, told States Newsroom. \"These are issues that our constituents are demanding protections on, rightfully so.\"\n\nGriffith is the sponsor of the Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act, which was signed last year, and will take effect on Jan. 1, 2025. The law will give residents the right to know what information is being collected by companies, correct any inaccuracies in data or request to have that data deleted. The bill is similar to other state laws around the country that address how personal data can be used.\n\nThere's been no shortage of tech regulation bills in congress, but none have passed. The 118th congress saw bills relating to imposing restrictions on artificial intelligence models that are deemed high risk, creating regulatory authorities to oversee AI development, imposing transparency requirements on evolving technologies and protecting consumers through liability measures.\n\nIn April, a new draft of the American Privacy Rights act of 2024 was introduced, and in May, the Bipartisan Senate Artificial Intelligence Working Group released a roadmap for AI policy which aims to support federal investment in AI while safeguarding the risks of the technology.\n\nGriffith also introduced a bill this year to create the Delaware Artificial Intelligence Commission, and said that if the state stands idly by, they'll fall behind on these already quickly evolving technologies.\n\n\"The longer we wait, the more behind we are in understanding how it's being utilized, stopping or preventing potential damage from happening, or even not being able to harness some of the efficiency that comes with it that might help government services and might help individuals live better lives,\" Griffith said.\n\nStates have been legislating about AI since at least 2019, but bills relating to AI have increased significantly in the last two years. From January through June of this year, there have been more than 300 introduced, said Heather Morton, who tracks state legislation as an analyst for the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nAlso so far this year, 11 new states have enacted laws about how to use, regulate or place checks and balances on AI, bringing the total to 28 states with AI legislation.\n\nTechnologists have been experimenting with decision-making algorithms for decades -- early frameworks date back to the 1950s. But generative AI, which can generate images, language, and responses to prompts in seconds, is what's driven the industry in the last few years.\n\nMany Americans have been interacting with artificial intelligence their whole lives, and industries like banking, marketing and entertainment have built much of their modern business practices upon AI systems. These technologies have become the backbone of huge developments like power grids and space exploration.\n\nMost people are more aware of their smaller uses, like a company's online customer service chatbot or asking their Alexa or Google Assistant devices for information about the weather.\n\nRachel Wright, a policy analyst for the Council of State Governments, pinpointed a potential turning point in the public consciousness of AI, which may have added urgency for legislators to act.\n\n\"I think 2022 is a big year because of ChatGPT,\" Wright said. \"It was kind of the first point in which members of the public were really interacting with an AI system or a generative AI system, like ChatGPT, for the first time.\"\n\nAndrew Gamino-Cheong cofounded AI governance management platform Trustible early last year as the states began to pump out legislation. The platform helps organizations identify risky uses of AI and comply with regulations that have already been put in place.\n\nBoth state and federal legislators understand the risk in passing new AI laws: too many regulations on AI can be seen as stifling innovation, while unchecked AI could raise privacy problems or perpetuate discrimination.\n\nColorado's law is an example of this -- it applies to developers on \"high-risk\" systems which make consequential decisions relating to hiring, banking and housing. It says these developers have a responsibility to avoid creating algorithms that could have biases against certain groups or traits. The law dictates that instances of this \"algorithmic discrimination\" need to be reported to the attorney general's office.\n\nAt the time, Logan Cerkovnik, the founder and CEO of Denver-based Thumper.ai, called the bill \"wide-reaching\" but well-intentioned, saying his developers will have to think about how the major social changes in the bill are supposed to work.\n\n\"Are we shifting from actual discrimination to the risk of discrimination before it happens?\" he added.\n\nBut Delaware's Rep. Griffith said that these life-changing decisions, like getting approved for a mortgage, should be transparent and traceable. If she's denied a mortgage due to a mistake in an algorithm, how could she appeal?\n\n\"I think that also helps us understand where the technology is going wrong,\" she said. \"We need to know where it's going right, but we also have to understand where it's going wrong.\"\n\nSome who work in the development of big tech see federal or state regulations of AI as potentially stifling to innovation. But Gamino-Cheong said he actually thinks some of this \"patchwork\" legislation by states could create pressure for some clear federal action from lawmakers who see AI as a huge growth area for the U.S.\n\n\"I think that's one area where the privacy and AI discussions could diverge a little bit, that there's a competitive, even national security angle, to investing in AI,\" he said.\n\nWright published research late last year on AI's role in the states, categorizing the approaches states were using to create protections around the technology. Many of the 29 laws enacted at that point focused on creating avenues for stakeholder groups to meet and collaborate on how to use and regulate AI. Others recognize possible innovations enabled by AI, but regulate data privacy.\n\nTransparency, protection from discrimination and accountability are other major themes in the states' legislation. Since the start of 2024, laws that touch on the use of AI in political campaigns, schooling, crime data, sexual offenses and deepfakes -- convincing computer-generated likenesses - have been passed, broadening the scope in how a law can regulate AI. Now, 28 states have passed nearly 60 laws.\n\nHere's a look at where legislation stands in July 2024, in broad categorization:\n\nSome states have enacted laws that inform people that AI is being used. This is most commonly done by requiring businesses to disclose when and how it's in use. For example, an employer may have to get permission from employees to use an AI system that collects data about them. These states have transparency laws: California (SB 1001), Florida (S 1680), Illinois (HB 2557), and Maryland (HB 1202).\n\nThese laws often require that AI systems are designed with equity in mind, and avoid \"algorithmic discrimination,\" where an AI system can contribute to different treatment of people based on race, ethnicity, sex, religion or disability, among other things. Often these laws play out in the criminal justice system, in hiring, in banking or other positions where a computer algorithm is making life-changing decisions. This includes California (SB 36), Colorado (SB 21-169), Illinois (HB 0053), and Utah (H 366).\n\nLaws focusing on AI in elections have been passed in the last two years, and primarily either ban messaging and images created by AI or at least require specific disclaimers about the use of AI in campaign materials. This includes Alabama (HB 172), Arizona (HB 2394), Idaho (HB 664), Florida (HB 919), New Mexico (HB 182), Oregon (SB 1571), Utah (SB 131), and Wisconsin (SB 664).\n\nStates that have passed laws relating to AI in education mainly provide requirements for the use of AI tools. Florida (HB 1361) outlines how tools may be used to customize and accelerate learning, and Tennessee (S 1711) instructs schools to create an AI policy for the 2024-25 school year which describes how the board will enforce its policy.\n\nThe states which have passed laws about computer-generated explicit images criminalize the creation of sexually explicit images of children with the use of AI. These include Iowa (HF 2240) and South Dakota (S 79).\n\nWhile most of the AI laws enacted have focused on protecting users from the harms of AI, many legislators are also excited by its potential.\n\nA recent study by the World Economic Forum has found that artificial intelligence technologies could lead to the creation of about 97 million new jobs worldwide by 2025, outpacing the approximately 85 million jobs displaced to technology or machines.\n\nRep. Griffith is looking forward to digging more into the technologies' capabilities in a working group, saying it's challenging to legislate about technology that changes so rapidly, but it's also fun.\n\n\"Sometimes the tendency when something's complicated or challenging or difficult to understand is like, you just want to run and stick your head under the blanket,\" she said. \"But it's like, everybody stop. Let's look at it, let's understand it, let's read about it. Let's have an honest discussion about how it's being utilized and how it's helping.\"", "source": {"uri": "ohiocapitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ohio Capital Journal"}, "authors": [],

This revolution, marked not by upheaval but by the gentle hum of computers and the boundless curiosity of students and innovators, is reshaping the landscape of opportunity through the power of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThis article is about using AI to enhance, not replace, the human element in society, particularly in a country like South Africa, where unemployment rates are at an all-time high and opportunities may seem scarce to most people.\n\nIn South Africa, the narrative around AI often raises concerns about job displacement. However, AI should be viewed as a supportive tool designed to enhance human capabilities and create new opportunities for upskilling and upliftment. The focus needs to be on finding ways for AI to work alongside people to foster innovation, entrepreneurship, and efficiency, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.\n\nThere is no doubt that AI technologies are enabling personalized learning experiences, ensuring individuals receive tailored content and support based on their needs. Of course, it is vital that we actively address bias in AI systems, especially when implementing them in early education. AI must be made accessible to all schools, enhancing learning effectiveness and empowering individuals. This approach ensures that everyone can benefit from AI, making learning more effective and relevant but more importantly, the outcome needs to be AI empowering people to become more skilled and adaptable to thrive in a dynamic job market.\n\nAI tools are paving the way for a new wave of entrepreneurs and innovators in South Africa. By providing access to powerful technologies, individuals are able to create unique businesses and offerings. Whether it's developing new AI-driven products or using AI to improve existing processes, the opportunities are vast.\n\nIn innovative spaces, people engage with cutting-edge technologies, including AI, machine learning, robotics, and IoT. These tools are not just for large corporations but are accessible to anyone with the drive to learn and innovate.\n\nA number of open-source and proprietary tools are available:\n\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is not just a concept; it's a seismic shift that is reshaping industries and societies. In South Africa, and indeed across developing markets, the impact of 4IR technologies like AI is profound. These technologies promise to drive economic growth, transform education, and revolutionize healthcare. Yet, they also bring challenges -- an urgent need for upskilling, investment in digital infrastructure, and ethical considerations.\n\nBy addressing these challenges through comprehensive programs and initiatives, we can equip individuals with the skills of the future, preparing them to be leaders in this new era.", "source": {"uri": "itnewsafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITNewsAfrica.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mamsi_nkosi@itnewsafrica.com", "name": "Mamsi Nkosi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet of things"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fourth Industrial Revolution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.itnewsafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ITNA_Logo-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

This enthusiasm is backed by substantial investments from tech giants such as Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft -- not to mention AI upstart OpenAI, who are collectively budgeting an estimated $400 billion this year for AI-related hardware and research and development.\n\nHowever, the reality of AI's impact on the global economy presents a more sobering picture. For AI to truly transform business operations worldwide, companies across various sectors need to integrate the technology, adapt it to their specific needs, and leverage it to boost productivity. While investors have added over $2 trillion to the market value of the five big tech firms in the past year, projecting an additional $300-400 billion in annual revenues, the actual results fall far short of these expectations.\n\nEven optimistic analysts predict that Microsoft, a leader in AI development, will only generate about $10 billion from generative AI-related sales this year. Beyond the tech-saturated west coast of the United States, there is little evidence of AI significantly impacting business operations or economic indicators.\n\nThe rate of AI adoption presents a significant challenge. While some consultancies and tech companies report high usage rates of AI among knowledge workers and businesses, official statistics paint a different picture. The U.S. Census Bureau, which provides some of the most reliable estimates, found that only five percent of businesses have used AI in the past fortnight. Similar low adoption rates are observed in other countries, with Canada reporting six percent of firms using AI to make goods and provide services in the past year.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to this slow adoption. Concerns about data security, algorithmic bias, and AI hallucinations have made many businesses cautious. Some companies are hesitant to invest in AI projects due to the rapid pace of technological development, fearing that their investments may quickly become obsolete. Others struggle with \"pilotitis,\" where an abundance of small AI projects makes it difficult to identify the most promising areas for investment.\n\nCompanies that have integrated AI into their operations typically use it for a narrow range of tasks, such as streamlining customer service or personalizing marketing efforts. However, these applications have yet to demonstrate significant impacts on company performance or market valuations. Goldman Sachs' AI adoption index, which tracks companies with the largest potential earnings changes from AI adoption, has not outperformed the broader stock market since late 2022, suggesting investors see little prospect of extra profits from AI integration.\n\nMoreover, there is little evidence of an AI-driven surge in productivity. Output per employee in the median rich country is not growing, and in the United States, output per hour remains below its pre-2020 trend. This lack of productivity growth is mirrored in global purchasing managers' surveys, which show no signs of a productivity boom.\n\nRead more at the Economist here.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucas_nolan@breitbart.com", "name": "Lucas Nolan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithmic bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Strategic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Strategic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/03/robot-in-a-dunce-cap.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

With the study revealing how a potential \u00a3119 billion windfall in productive work for UK enterprises may be untapped thanks to AI, the UK could be on the cusp of a seismic shift after struggling to make meaningful productivity growth for a decade and a half, with current productivity levels 24% lower than they would have been had pre-2008 trends continued.\n\nFurther findings from the data reveal the current state of UK productivity and how AI can help:\n\n\"Sizeable productivity growth has eluded UK workplaces for over 15 years - but responsible AI is set to shift the paradigm,\" said Daniel Pell, vice president and country manager, UKI, Workday. \"However, AI technologies can only achieve these transformative results if they are trustworthy, which is why Workday AI solutions are designed with transparency, explainability, and reliability from the start. We encourage businesses to take a two-pronged approach when it comes to deploying AI: a concrete analysis of the efficiencies AI can drive, alongside a transparent strategy to tackle the material and cultural barriers to its adoption. As this report reveals, for those that get it right, the results can be transformative for growth.\"\n\nQuantifying AI's Productivity Potential\n\nIn an 8-hour workday, the study found employees and business leaders report being genuinely productive for 5.8 and 5.9 hours respectively, leaving over a quarter of the day unproductive and not generating financial value.\n\nWith these lost hours in mind, the role of AI becomes clear. When asked about how much time they expect to save if AI was used to its full potential, both employees and business leaders are bullish. Employees claim 2.9 hours could be saved each day with business leaders predicting almost double this at 4.4 hours.\n\nAn additional 2.9 hours of work per day is the equivalent of \u00a311,058 a year of added work for each average employee, based on salaries reported. So overall, \u00a3119 billion worth of productive work each year could be untapped across UK large enterprises, through the use of AI.\n\nRemoving Barriers to AI Adoption to Meet Productivity Desires\n\nWhile AI's potential to transform productivity is clear, barriers to adoption remain. According to leaders, the largest concerns they feel delaying their organisation's progress in AI are: fears over safety/privacy/bias (38%), needing more time to educate teams (34%) and lack of investment (32%).\n\nThese fears and concerns must be overcome in addition to the following obstacles which the data shows are harming organisation's productivity: unengaged employees (41%), lack of incentives (41%), and inadequate technology (35%).\n\nOf particular concern is the issue of trust in AI, with 93% of both employees and leaders having concerns relating to trust in AI.

The potential savings in employee hours and increase in individual productivity are especially exciting as AI can take the burden of mundane tasks, giving employees more time and energy to focus on their targeted areas of work.\n\nWhile taking advantage of AI and new technologies, it's critical that we adopt a holistic approach. AI often raises safety and privacy concerns, therefore communication and comprehensive training in new technologies are essential to integrate AI in the best, most transformative way possible.\"\n\nThe transformative power of AI extends beyond individual productivity gains. AI can significantly boost the UK economy by enhancing operational efficiency, fostering innovation, and creating new business opportunities. By automating routine tasks, AI allows businesses to focus on higher-value activities, driving innovation and competitiveness. This shift can lead to the creation of new jobs and industries, stimulating economic growth.\n\nMoreover, AI can optimize supply chains, improve customer service, and enhance decision-making processes across various sectors, from finance and healthcare to manufacturing and retail. By leveraging AI technologies, UK businesses can achieve greater agility and resilience, crucial in today's rapidly changing economic landscape.\n\nWhile the implementation of AI comes with challenges, the potential benefits in terms of productivity and economic growth are substantial.

In the absence of federal action, states are increasingly striking out on their own to regulate artificial intelligence and other automated systems. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images.)\n\nAs congressional sessions have passed without any new federal artificial intelligence laws, state legislators are striking out on their own to regulate the technologies in the meantime.\n\nColorado just signed into effect one of the most sweeping regulatory laws in the country, which sets guardrails for companies that develop and use AI. Its focus is mitigating consumer harm and discrimination by AI systems, and Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said he hopes the conversations will continue on the state and federal level.\n\nOther states, like New Mexico, have focused on regulating how computer generated images can appear in media and political campaigns. Some, like Iowa, have criminalized sexually charged computer-generated images, especially when they portray children.\n\n\"We can't just sit and wait,\" Delaware state Rep. Krista Griffith, D-Wilmington, who has sponsored AI regulation, told States Newsroom. \"These are issues that our constituents are demanding protections on, rightfully so.\"\n\nGriffith is the sponsor of the Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act, which was signed last year, and will take effect on Jan. 1, 2025. The law will give residents the right to know what information is being collected by companies, correct any inaccuracies in data or request to have that data deleted. The bill is similar to other state laws around the country that address how personal data can be used.\n\nThere's been no shortage of tech regulation bills in Congress, but none have passed. The 118th Congress saw bills relating to imposing restrictions on artificial intelligence models that are deemed high risk, creating regulatory authorities to oversee AI development, imposing transparency requirements on evolving technologies and protecting consumers through liability measures.\n\nIn April, a new draft of the American Privacy Rights act of 2024 was introduced, and in May, the Bipartisan Senate Artificial Intelligence Working Group released a roadmap for AI policy which aims to support federal investment in AI while safeguarding the risks of the technology.\n\nGriffith also introduced a bill this year to create the Delaware Artificial Intelligence Commission, and said that if the state stands idly by, they'll fall behind on these already quickly evolving technologies.\n\n\"The longer we wait, the more behind we are in understanding how it's being utilized, stopping or preventing potential damage from happening, or even not being able to harness some of the efficiency that comes with it that might help government services and might help individuals live better lives,\" Griffith said.\n\nStates have been legislating about AI since at least 2019, but bills relating to AI have increased significantly in the last two years. From January through June of this year, there have been more than 300 introduced, said Heather Morton, who tracks state legislation as an analyst for the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nAlso so far this year, 11 new states have enacted laws about how to use, regulate or place checks and balances on AI, bringing the total to 28 states with AI legislation.\n\nTechnologists have been experimenting with decision-making algorithms for decades -- early frameworks date back to the 1950s. But generative AI, which can generate images, language, and responses to prompts in seconds, is what's driven the industry in the last few years.\n\nMany Americans have been interacting with artificial intelligence their whole lives, and industries like banking, marketing and entertainment have built much of their modern business practices upon AI systems. These technologies have become the backbone of huge developments like power grids and space exploration.\n\nMost people are more aware of their smaller uses, like a company's online customer service chatbot or asking their Alexa or Google Assistant devices for information about the weather.\n\nRachel Wright, a policy analyst for the Council of State Governments, pinpointed a potential turning point in the public consciousness of AI, which may have added urgency for legislators to act.\n\n\"I think 2022 is a big year because of ChatGPT,\" Wright said. \"It was kind of the first point in which members of the public were really interacting with an AI system or a generative AI system, like ChatGPT, for the first time.\"\n\nAndrew Gamino-Cheong cofounded AI governance management platform Trustible early last year as the states began to pump out legislation. The platform helps organizations identify risky uses of AI and comply with regulations that have already been put in place.\n\nBoth state and federal legislators understand the risk in passing new AI laws: too many regulations on AI can be seen as stifling innovation, while unchecked AI could raise privacy problems or perpetuate discrimination.\n\nColorado's law is an example of this -- it applies to developers on \"high-risk\" systems which make consequential decisions relating to hiring, banking and housing. It says these developers have a responsibility to avoid creating algorithms that could have biases against certain groups or traits. The law dictates that instances of this \"algorithmic discrimination\" need to be reported to the attorney general's office.\n\nAt the time, Logan Cerkovnik, the founder and CEO of Denver-based Thumper.ai, called the bill \"wide-reaching\" but well-intentioned, saying his developers will have to think about how the major social changes in the bill are supposed to work.\n\n\"Are we shifting from actual discrimination to the risk of discrimination before it happens?\" he added.\n\nBut Delaware's Rep. Griffith said that these life-changing decisions, like getting approved for a mortgage, should be transparent and traceable. If she's denied a mortgage due to a mistake in an algorithm, how could she appeal?\n\n\"I think that also helps us understand where the technology is going wrong,\" she said. \"We need to know where it's going right, but we also have to understand where it's going wrong.\"\n\nSome who work in the development of big tech see federal or state regulations of AI as potentially stifling to innovation. But Gamino-Cheong said he actually thinks some of this \"patchwork\" legislation by states could create pressure for some clear federal action from lawmakers who see AI as a huge growth area for the U.S.\n\n\"I think that's one area where the privacy and AI discussions could diverge a little bit, that there's a competitive, even national security angle, to investing in AI,\" he said.\n\nWright published research late last year on AI's role in the states, categorizing the approaches states were using to create protections around the technology. Many of the 29 laws enacted at that point focused on creating avenues for stakeholder groups to meet and collaborate on how to use and regulate AI. Others recognize possible innovations enabled by AI, but regulate data privacy.\n\nTransparency, protection from discrimination and accountability are other major themes in the states' legislation. Since the start of 2024, laws that touch on the use of AI in political campaigns, schooling, crime data, sexual offenses and deepfakes -- convincing computer-generated likenesses - have been passed, broadening the scope in how a law can regulate AI. Now, 28 states have passed nearly 60 laws.\n\nHere's a look at where legislation stands in July 2024, in broad categorization:\n\nSome states have enacted laws that inform people that AI is being used. This is most commonly done by requiring businesses to disclose when and how it's in use. For example, an employer may have to get permission from employees to use an AI system that collects data about them. These states have transparency laws: California (SB 1001), Florida (S 1680), Illinois (HB 2557), and Maryland (HB 1202).\n\nThese laws often require that AI systems are designed with equity in mind, and avoid \"algorithmic discrimination,\" where an AI system can contribute to different treatment of people based on race, ethnicity, sex, religion or disability, among other things. Often these laws play out in the criminal justice system, in hiring, in banking or other positions where a computer algorithm is making life-changing decisions. This includes California (SB 36), Colorado (SB 21-169), Illinois (HB 0053), and Utah (H 366).\n\nLaws focusing on AI in elections have been passed in the last two years, and primarily either ban messaging and images created by AI or at least require specific disclaimers about the use of AI in campaign materials. This includes Alabama (HB 172), Arizona (HB 2394), Idaho (HB 664), Florida (HB 919), New Mexico (HB 182), Oregon (SB 1571), Utah (SB 131), and Wisconsin (SB 664).\n\nStates that have passed laws relating to AI in education mainly provide requirements for the use of AI tools. Florida (HB 1361) outlines how tools may be used to customize and accelerate learning, and Tennessee (S 1711) instructs schools to create an AI policy for the 2024-25 school year which describes how the board will enforce its policy.\n\nThe states which have passed laws about computer-generated explicit images criminalize the creation of sexually explicit images of children with the use of AI. These include Iowa (HF 2240) and South Dakota (S 79).\n\nWhile most of the AI laws enacted have focused on protecting users from the harms of AI, many legislators are also excited by its potential.\n\nA recent study by the World Economic Forum has found that artificial intelligence technologies could lead to the creation of about 97 million new jobs worldwide by 2025, outpacing the approximately 85 million jobs displaced to technology or machines.\n\nRep. Griffith is looking forward to digging more into the technologies' capabilities in a working group, saying it's challenging to legislate about technology that changes so rapidly, but it's also fun.\n\n\"Sometimes the tendency when something's complicated or challenging or difficult to understand is like, you just want to run and stick your head under the blanket,\" she said. \"But it's like, everybody stop. Let's look at it, let's understand it, let's read about it. Let's have an honest discussion about how it's being utilized and how it's helping.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Learn More\n\nWomen have long been underrepresented in the tech field -- and AI is no different. But that's in no way a reflection of their interest in technology and eagerness to adopt generative AI tools.\n\nIn fact, 68% of female respondents to a new survey from Women Go Tech have used at least one AI tool -- hands down, the No. 1 preferred is ChatGPT -- and 61% said they wanted to learn more about AI tools and applications.\n\nStill, women can be hesitant initially due to insecurities fueled by age-old biases and discrimination, as well as fears about data privacy and ethical use of the technology, the survey discovered.\n\n\"Women are generally very interested in AI and its potential applications but often hesitate to engage deeply with AI tools,\" Women Go Tech writes in a report summarizing the findings. \"The technical nature of AI and prevailing gender stereotypes may lead many women to feel less confident about their ability to effectively use and understand AI tools. This lack of confidence is a significant barrier that prevents them from fully engaging with the technology.\"\n\nDiscrimination, bias, 'Matilda Syndrome' still persist\n\nSupported by Google.org and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the survey polled 5,400 respondents from 13 European countries. Women were split into four categories: those interested in tech careers (31%), those not interested in tech careers (30%), those who have worked in tech for more than 2 years (27%) and those who have worked in the tech sector for less than two years (12%).\n\nOf the aspiring technologists, 77% were interested in AI, while 64.6% of tech sector novices and 63.9% of experienced talent said they wanted to learn about the technology.\n\nBeyond ChatGPT, those who had tried out the technology tinkered with OpenAI Codex, Bard/Gemini and GPT-4. The most popular use cases were translation, navigation/travel and search for answers.\n\nHowever, one-quarter of respondents -- across both new and experienced talent groups -- reported that they did not feel entirely comfortable with their technical skills.\n\n\"It would be hard to believe that specialists would find their general tech skills lacking, so it is important to consider how factors like low confidence, lack of encouragement or access to education might also influence someone's self-esteem,\" the report emphasizes.\n\nWomen often underestimate their abilities due to \"pervasive stereotypes and societal expectations\" that can deter them from technology, which in turn leads to a lack of female representation and ongoing bias, the report notes. Also, many women experience \"imposter syndrome,\" where they do not feel like they belong in their roles despite having the necessary skills and qualifications.\n\n\"We have amazing female engineers, mathematicians,\" said Ana Pric\u0103-Cruceanu, chief SDG strategy officer -AFIST, Women4Ethical AI at UNESCO. \"We need to highlight these role models. We need to talk about the Matilda effect [when the work of female scientists is attributed to men]. We need to make sure they understand that you can start in tech at any age.\"\n\nIndeed, 28% of respondents reported that they had experienced discrimination, and 32% were concerned that they might experience it in the future.\n\nParadoxically, though, 46.5% of respondents \"strongly agreed\" that AI technologies are designed with diverse user perspectives in mind. This is quite the divergence from experts who say that women are \"markedly underrepresented\" in AI development and training datasets, which can lead to discrimination and AI bias.\n\nThis can lead to a lack of role models, mentorship opportunities and a \"cycle of continuous exclusion,\" the report notes.\n\n\"I think it's important that women support each other in the field,\" said Lili Kuusk, CEO of the Estonian Association of Information Technology. \"They may be alone in one company, but overall, in the field, they are not alone.\"\n\nVague company policies\n\nMany organizations are rushing to implement AI tools -- but have yet to establish clear policies around the technology. Reflecting this, 30% of survey respondents said they were not sure about their employer's policy and just 8% said they have received guidance on how to use AI at work.\n\nConversely -- and not surprisingly -- employer policies that allow and guide AI use correlate to the highest usage rates (69.4%), followed by clear, prescriptive policies (64.1%).\n\nOther factors hindering survey respondents from using AI were a lack of clear understanding about how the technology works and concerns about data privacy and ethical use.\n\n\"Companies should ensure all employees are aware of AI policies and how these tools can facilitate their work,\" the report authors emphasize.\n\nThis includes providing easy-to-understand learning materials, establishing support networks for sharing AI experiences and educating on AI's privacy and safety aspects. It is also important to highlight how AI can enhance rather than replace human interactions, the report authors note.\n\nTo support those highly interested in using the technology, employers might emphasize AI as a \"career enhancer\" and provide tailored learning paths with hands-on projects or certifications that align with their career aspirations, the authors suggest.\n\nMeanwhile, employers might help more advanced \"power users\" to become mentors who lead workshops or present at conferences. They might also consider offering specialized courses in advanced AI fields such as machine learning (ML) and robotics, and encourage participation in hackathons and collaborative projects that provide practical expertise and allow them to showcase their skills.\n\nThe authors conclude: \"By providing clear frameworks and support, employers can effectively encourage women to engage more deeply with AI technologies, enhancing their skills and confidence in utilizing these tools in their professional roles.\"", "source": {"uri": "venturebeat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VentureBeat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "taryn_plumb@venturebeat.com", "name": "Taryn Plumb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google.org", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google.org"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_role", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender role"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_Codex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI Codex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matilda effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Role model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-esteem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNESCO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hackathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cfr0z3n_an_abstract_vector_art_image_line_art_flat_illustration_4cb813da-6d93-4317-8182-1fae7a1000ab.png?w=1024?w=1200&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Such systems can provide a variety of valuable benefits, from enabling always-on customer service to enhancing existing products to helping employees more quickly, easily and efficiently perform tasks.\n\nThere are many cost, competitive and productivity advantages that a well-designed interactive AI system can bring -- but developing one comes with complications companies must be prepared for. Below, 20 members of Forbes Technology Council detail some of the challenges that come with building a robust, safe and well-functioning interactive AI system and how they can be solved.\n\nIn my experience, the biggest issue organizations face when developing an AI system is framing the problem to be solved. Too often, AI is implemented on top of old, bloated processes with the aim of making a business function more efficiently. To deliver real impact, a more effective mindset is, \"How do we use this technology to solve an issue that has been impossible to address before?\" - Mark Cameron, Alyve Consulting\n\nA key challenge in developing an interactive AI system is ensuring you have the internal capabilities needed to build and maintain it, including data, infrastructure and expertise. Additionally, aligning stakeholders' and users' expectations is crucial. Misalignment can lead to dissatisfaction and underutilization of the AI system. - Fabiana Clemente, YData\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?\n\nOne challenge in developing an interactive AI system is minimizing hallucinations, where the AI generates inaccurate or nonsensical outputs. You can minimize hallucinations and ensure more accurate, relevant responses by leveraging proprietary knowledge and building robust workflows with continuous feedback from end users. - Rick Zhuang, Firework\n\nA key challenge in building an interactive AI system is ensuring relevant responses. With users making wide-ranging requests, there must be intelligent orchestration to grasp true intent and optimize inputs and outputs. Without such orchestration, interactions quickly become hit-or-miss. Orchestration will help the system develop trustworthy, contextualized responses and create seamless user experiences. - Alex Saric, Ivalua\n\nCreating natural, coherent, conversational AI requires advanced language models trained on massive knowledge bases and interactive environments. Curated training data and infrastructure enable rapid feedback and the safe exploration of cutting-edge techniques such as commonsense reasoning and open-domain Q&A. This iterative process unlocks the next era of interactive AI experiences. - Karan Jain, NayaOne\n\nTrust is a major challenge. The best way to build trust is to ensure that humans are in the loop. In machine learning systems, human-in-the-loop approaches are crucial for establishing trust in advance of full automation. Humans must treat GenAI outputs as if they were created by a junior employee, reviewing, validating and correcting these outputs as necessary. - Lalitha Rajagopalan, ORO Labs, Inc.\n\nAccuracy isn't just an internal development challenge; it's a hot topic for anyone discussing AI. Hallucinations are always a concern with interactive AI, but with the right guardrails in place, those hallucinations can be negated. Multiple layers of guardrails can ensure heightened accuracy, and implementing those guardrails should be just as big of a priority as AI development itself. - Frank Fawzi, IntelePeer\n\nAlgorithmic discrimination is one of the main challenges when developing an interactive AI system. To minimize bias, companies need to explore creating privacy-focused AI models that leverage high-performance computing power and enable real-time, precise decision-making without necessarily compromising user privacy. - Justin Lie, SHIELD AI Technologies\n\nIt will be difficult to manage the access rights for AI accounts. Moreover, if AI relies on faulty data sources or training, it could lead to serious problems. Another challenge is that large and sensitive data models may require human verification, which could take a lot of time. If hackers break into the communication between users and AI systems, they could perform insider attacks easily. - Thangaraj Petchiappan, iLink Digital\n\nThe biggest challenge is earning and keeping users' trust. Ensure your system's information adheres to legal restrictions and moral guidelines, providing accurate data. Train AI models on diverse, legally acquired datasets. Handle user data with care, avoiding its use for model training, and ensure users retain ownership of their data. This approach helps maintain trust and complies with legal and ethical standards. - Slava Podmurnyi, Visartech Inc.\n\nEnsure the AI model can understand and respond appropriately to a wide range of user inputs, including ambiguous or poorly phrased queries. This challenge, in the domain of natural language understanding (NLU), can be addressed by training the AI model with large and diverse datasets. This broad coverage ensures the model can handle the various ways users might phrase their queries. - Andy Boyd, Appfire\n\nThe big challenge is cultural sensitivity. Different cultures have unique norms, making it difficult for an AI system, often trained on broad or universal values, to cater to all appropriately. This can be overcome by creating sovereign solutions tailored to specific regions and using local datasets to train the AI. This approach ensures that the system is aligned with the cultural context. - Andre Reitenbach, Gcore\n\nOne emerging issue in developing an interactive AI system is ensuring data privacy and security. This challenge can be addressed through robust encryption protocols, stringent access controls and continuous vulnerability monitoring. Additionally, integrating privacy-by-design principles during development ensures proactive data protection, preempting potential issues before they manifest. - Christopher Rogers, Carenet Health\n\nA company must sanitize the inputs to its AI system or risk the exposure of sensitive data or the system behaving in unpredictable ways. Using techniques such as paraphrasing user inputs ensures that users aren't hijacking your model through the inclusion of malicious prompts. You should also be checking and validating outputs to ensure they match expected targets and behaviors. - Matt Dickson, Eclipse Telecom\n\nPeople tend to assume AI systems are correct, and therefore, they don't edit or override the results. This could be because they're busy, lazy or don't feel confident questioning the output. But AI is imperfect and still requires human verification for many tasks. Companies need to prepare for this and be explicit about the level of intervention needed to get accurate results. - David Talby, John Snow Labs\n\nA challenge in developing interactive AI is ensuring it's well-timed. Consider chatbots: They often pop up at random, offering help or suggestions that may be wholly irrelevant to you. Particularly in industries such as commerce, you want to engineer your AI around key moments in the buying journey. It should interact with consumers when they're actually open to receiving support or guidance. - Raj De Datta, Bloomreach\n\nThe best types of interactive AI systems are ones that foster personalization. Accomplishing this starts with feeding your algorithms the right data and, even more importantly, the right context. Training systems on the wrong data or too much data inherently creates bottlenecks. Tapping into the right datasets directly leads to customized and intuitive interactive AI systems. - Gleb Polyakov, Nylas\n\nA major challenge in developing an interactive AI system is that large language models output natural language, while most systems use formats such as JSON or XML. Overcoming this requires a conversion layer to translate LLM outputs into structured formats. Utilizing robust prompt engineering techniques in this layer can accurately map and transform responses, ensuring seamless integration with existing systems. - Hashim Hayat, Walturn\n\nMost AI models today operate as \"black boxes,\" offering very little visibility into how decisions are made. This can lead to biased or unsafe decisions. As far as possible, companies leveraging AI in their products should prioritize transparency, including providing information about how the AI functions and how they manage user data. - Mike Britton, Abnormal Security\n\nAn interactive AI system needs to be customized for the user and purpose, and this requires contextual data. When developing custom AI models using retrieval-augmented generation, properly managing user access and enforcing data permissions is crucial for security. This starts with classifying data and carefully identifying and enforcing permissions to access data that are in line with the business purpose of the system and the user. - Claude Mandy, Symmetry Systems Inc.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cameron_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Cameron (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "End user"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_information_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief information officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High-performance computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_reasoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commonsense reasoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iteration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion_Detection_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion Detection Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65e8b14a1f39e227ab043801/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1189,669,x0,y123,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Conrad Bovell, branch chief of cybersecurity advisory and strategy at the Department of Health and Human Services, said that researchers at the National Institute of Health created an AI tool to leverage clinical data to gauge if a given immunotherapy drug would be effective at treating a patient's cancer.\n\nNIH Senior Data Scientist Nathan Hotaling offered another internal AI application, which would use generative AI software to read unstructured data -- such as notes stored in a PDF document -- and convert it into searchable text and data.\n\nStephanie Wilson, an agreements officer within the Department of Defense's Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office, said during the panel that her agency has been using generative AI to do similar work with unstructured data, with the ultimate aim to ease administrative burdens, particularly surrounding contracting paperwork, research and policies.\n\n\"I think that kind of impact is really what can help everyone, no matter what their field is, really do their job better, because it used to be reliant on humans to be able to get that contextual information from that unstructured data,\" Hotaling said. \"And now Gen AI really enables us to use it just like structured information.\"\n\nAt the National Science Foundation, Chief Information Officer Terry Carpenter said that his agency is looking to deploy a chatbot fueled by large language models, like other agencies, but is focused on specific AI algorithms that use retrieval or predictive analytics for customer experience support.\n\nFederal agencies are also interested in deploying AI in cybersecurity spaces. Bovell cited the double-edged sword AI can bring to such an arena: having cybersecurity teams monitor incoming network data with the help of pattern recognition algorithms, while simultaneously fighting the AI attacks leveraged by cyber criminals and malicious actors.\n\n\"AI models can identify patterns indicative of cyber threats such as malware, ransomware or unusual network traffic that might also include data from other existing traditional detection systems,\" Bovell said. \"Generative AI contributes to more sophisticated analysis and anomaly detection in [security information management] systems as well by learning from historical security data.\"\n\nChraibi said that wrangling some of the outstanding unstructured data in government systems runs parallel to cybersecurity challenges.\n\n\"I think the challenges in cybersecurity are kind of similar to what we have in that aspect of data access and management,\" he said. \"When you talk to a cybersecurity expert, the first thing they complain about is the lack of time, is the lack of bandwidth, that they have. So that's where I see how generative AI can be leveraged properly, because [generative AI systems] can actually...assist them in doing the tedious work, and then basically elevating the threats where you might expect, [and] can actually tackle them.\"\n\nAs with any AI application, these federal use cases hinge on how algorithms handle input data and what outputs they generate. While agencies continue to adopt AI capabilities to expedite and facilitate government services, panelists discussed the need to reckon with outstanding security concerns.\n\nChraibi noted that data poisoning, hallucination and prompt injections can breed harmful or biased AI outputs. Carpenter echoed the lack of standardization in historical government data as an outstanding issue that can negatively impact how an AI algorithm will function.\n\n\"The data has been a thorn in our side for decades,\" Carpenter said. \"We never did finish a job of making the data really tagged appropriately, to understand the data, clean up the data. We need to do some of that.\"\n\nHe added that, at NSF, the first step to this is cultivating a stronger tech workforce. The agency is supporting curriculum development in prompt engineering to better understand AI and machine learning systems at a holistic level. This involves training everyone in the current workforce on the fundamentals of AI.\n\n\"They are different actors involved in different processes with different tools to execute those processes, to really be able to build out these capabilities,\" Carpenter said. \"IT is not the only party. This is taking even more emphasis off of IT and putting more emphasis back on the mission owner, who understands the data better than IT people to interact with their data on a regular basis and more frequently.\"\n\nChraibi agreed, and reiterated the well-known imperative that a human should be kept in the loop to prevent federal AI solutions from becoming a black box technology.\n\n\"[In] the development of GenAI and AI in general, solutions have to be a collaborative effort,\" Chraibi said. \"The panelists talked about the importance of data quality, so to make sure that that is complete, consistent, unbiased, etc, and that cannot be done just by the data scientists, it has to...get input from the subject matter experts that deal with that type of data.\"", "source": {"uri": "nextgov.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nextgov"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unstructured data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PDF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Machine_Learning", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/cd/2024/07/19/071924_getty_ng_data_viz/860x394.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Unsurprisingly there is no global standard on AI regulation. But we when we look at the existing and proposed safeguards intended to protect individuals where AI systems are introduced into the workplace, clear categories emerge. Set out in the table below is an analysis of how measures in key existing and proposed legislation could be categorised on this basis. This is by no means a comprehensive list - draft legislation is being debated and progressed around the world. For example, Canada's AI and Data Act envisages a risk based approach to regulation; the US Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence supports the creation of standards for trustworthy AI; and in the UK, the Department for Science Innovation has published detailed guidance on the responsible use of AI in recruitment. However, it will be interesting to see the extent to which the \"Brussels effect\" sees the approach taken in the EU spread around the world. Understanding the columns: \u27a2 Consultation about use: Is there a requirement to consult with employees/unions about the use of workplace AI systems? \u27a2 Accountability and governance: Are there specific roles, frameworks, policies or reporting structures required to manage the use of AI in the workplace? \u27a2 Impact assessments: Is there a requirement to undertake an impact assessment prior to use? \u27a2 Auditing and monitoring: What steps are required to ensure that the AI system is safe to use? Auditing meaning independent evaluation and monitoring meaning regular non-independent evaluation. \u27a2 Transparency and explainability: What level of openness is required about the use of AI and / or how the system's decisions are reached? Transparency meaning that the use and purpose of AI is disclosed. Explainability meaning that how an outcome was reached is disclosed. \u27a2 Human oversight / intervention: What human involvement is required? Human oversight meaning someone is required to oversee the operation of the system. Human intervention meaning that a human interposed between the AI system expressing preferences and the final decision. \u27a2 Contestability: Are measures required to enable an individual affected by an AI decision to be able to challenge it effectively? Overview Consultation about use Accountability and governance Impact assessments Auditing and monitoring Transparency and explainability Human oversight / intervention Contestability UK Government White Paper: principles for regulators Framework of five principles to guide regulators, rather than legislation: 1. Safety, security and robustness 2. Appropriate transparency and explainability 3. Fairness 4. Accountability and governance 5. Contestability and redress Focus is on regulating the use not the technology. Regulators' strategic responses published here. No reference 4 th regulatory principle.

Not specifically referred to in principes but covered by assurance techniques and technical standards identified as key to supporting regulatory framework. See AI standards hub, roadmap for AI assurance and portfolio of AI assurance technologies . 1 st regulatory principle refers to the need to continually identify, assess and manage risks throughout the AI life cycle. 4 th regulatory principle also covers need for effective oversight. 2 nd regulatory principle. Guidance states that \"AI systems should be appropriately transparent and explainable\", such that the other principles have meaningful effect (e.g. accountability). Parties affected by an AI system should have \"sufficient information about AI systems to be able to enforce their rights\". 4 th regulatory principle. Guidance states that governance measures should \"ensure effective oversight of the supply and use of AI systems\" 5th regulatory principle. Guidance states that \"[w]here appropriate, users, impacted third parties and actors in the AI life cycle should be able to contest an AI decision or outcome that is harmful or creates material risk of harm.\" Regulators to implement proportionate measures to ensure outcomes of AI use are contestable where appropriate. Overview Consultation about use Accountability and governance Impact assessments Auditing and monitoring Transparency and explainability Human oversight / intervention Contestability Artificial Intelligence (Regulation and Employment Rights) Bill Taskforce commissioned by the TUC has published a draft Bill which sets out a detailed legislative framework for regulating the use of AI in the workplace. Most use cases in the employment context will be high-risk. Direct consultation with affected workers / employees required at least one month before highrisk decision making takes place. This must be repeated every 12 months. An employer must maintain a register of AI systems used for high-risk decision making. An employer can not undertake high-risk decisionmaking until a Workplace AI Risk Assessment has risk assessed an AI system in relation to health and safety, equality, data protection and human rights. While high-risk decision making continues, this must be repeated at least every year. Auditing the AI system could rebut the burden of proof in a discrimination claim. Right to personalised explanations for high-risk decisions which are or might reasonably be expected to be detrimental to employees, workers or jobseekers. Employees, workers or jobseekers will be entitled to a right to human reconsideration of a high-risk decision. In addition to the right to human reconsideration, breaches of duties such as the duties to consult and risk assess would be actionable in the employment tribunal, potentially giving rise to an injury to feelings award. Automatic unfair dismissal when the decision arises from the unfair reliance on high-risk AI decision making. Changes regarding the burden of proof strengthen discrimination protection. Overview Consultation about use Accountability and governance Impact assessments Auditing and monitoring Transparency and explainability Human oversight / intervention Contestability The EU AI Act Risk based legislation. Published in Official Journal on [17] June 2024 Most use cases in the employment context will be high-risk. The majority of obligations fall on providers but deployers must also satisfy a range of requirements. Deployer: 1) Must inform workers' representatives that they will be subject to a high-risk AI system. 2) Must inform individuals that the deployer plans to use a high-risk AI system to make or assist in making decisions relating to an individual. Provider: 1) The system must ensure the automatic recording of events. 2) Must establish, implement, document and maintain a risk and quality management systems. 3) Must meet data governance requirements, including bias mitigation. 4) Must draw up and maintain technical documentation. 5) Comply with registration, recordkeeping, logging and traceability obligations, as well CE conformity obligations. Deployer: 1) Retain automatically generated logs for at least 6 months. Deployer: 1) Must use information from providers to carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) (likely to be required for high-risk system), 2) For certain deployers and certain high-risk systems, must undertake a fundamental rights impact assessment, assessing the system's impact on fundamental rights. Deployer: 1) Monitor the operation of the system on the basis of instructions for use. 2) Ensure input data in their control is relevant and sufficiently representative. Provider: 1) System must be designed so that deployers can interpret the output, use it appropriately and the instructions must include information specified in the Act. 2): Users must know that they are Interacting with an AI system and AIgenerated content must be identifiable (limited risk systems). Deployer: 1) If AI generated decision results in legal or similarly significantly effects (most employment decisions), must provide a clear and meaningful explanation of the role of the AI system in the decisionmaking process and the main elements of the decision. Provider: 1) System must be designed to allow for effective human oversight. Deployer: 1) Take certain appropriate technical and organisational measures and to assign human oversight. 2) Assign someone to oversee the AI system who is trained, competent, and has the support and authority they need. Overview Consultation about use Accountability and governance Impact assessments Auditing and monitoring Transparency and explainability Human oversight / intervention Contestability UK/EU GDPR The GDPR is a Regulation that requires businesses to protect the personal data and privacy of EU citizens. The accountability principle means as well as being responsible for complying with data protection law, you must also demonstrate that compliance in any AI system that processes personal data. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is required for processing that includes innovative technologies or the novel application of existing technologies. Therefore a DPIA should be carried out before an AI system is deployed Undertaking a DPIA, as well as the need to define procedures for ongoing compliance supervision and AI system audits. Also, regular checks to ensure AI systems function as anticipated/required. Individuals must be informed if their personal data is going to be used in an AI system. This information should be provided at the point of data collection. Individuals also need meaningful information about logic and consequences of any solely automated decisions. The automated decision making provision applies where there is solely automated decision-making that has legal or similarly significant effects. Often referred to as \"human in the loop\", for human review to be meaningful, it should come after the automated decision has taken place and it must relate to the actual outcome. Individuals must be able to contest a decision in a timely manner in order for the processing to be fair and compliant. Appropriate measures must be put in place to ensure individuals can exercise their rights.

Mandatory annual independent audit of the AEDT. Summary of the most recent results must be published. Independent auditor must (as a minimum) evaluate calculations of selection or scoring rates and the impact ratio across sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories. Employers and employment agencies must notify employees and job candidates who are residents of New York City that they are using an AEDT and the job qualifications or characteristics the AEDT will assess. Compliance is enforced by the NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Claims of discrimination involving an AEDT can be made to the NYC Commission on Human Rights.

No consultation obligations but the applicant's consent must be sought by employers to be evaluated by AI before the video interview. Employers may not use AI to evaluate a video interview without consent. Video interviews must only be shared with those whose expertise or technology is required to evaluate the interview. In other words, video interviews may be shared with vendors providing the AI used to analyse the interview. Employers must inform candidates before analysis takes place that AI is being used to assess their suitability for the role, how the AI works, and which characteristics will be used in the evaluation. The candidate's consent is required before any analysis takes place.

However, the Act may still be subject to scrutiny and amendment to 'fine tune' the provisions. Like the EU AI Act, the majority of obligations apply to high-risk AI systems (which may include systems used to make decisions about employment or employment opportunities) Deployers and Developers: Requirement to use reasonable care to safeguard consumers from the risks of algorithmic discrimination (whether known or reasonably foreseeable). Deployers: When deploying high-risk systems deployers must undertake impact assessments in respect of those systems at least once a year or within 90 days of any intended and substantial modification to any such system. Deployers and Developers: Varying reporting requirements to report certain confirmed or likely instances of algorithmic discrimination to the Attorney General within 90 days. Developer's reporting obligations also include providing such information to deployers that are known or other developers of the particular system. Deployers: High-risk AI will need to have a risk management policy and program, and an annual assessment to check they do not cause algorithmic discrimination. Developers and Deployers: Requirement to provide public notices online which includes certain information about their AI. Deployers also have transparency obligations which may require an additional pre or post use notice be provided where certain decisions will be/ have been made using high risk AI systems. Developers: Also required to provide both those deploying high-risk AI systems as well as other developers who may be substantially and intentionally modifying their systems with certain transparency information. Deployers: Where a high-risk system leads to an adverse consequential decision, deployers must provide notice which - among other things - provides the consumer with the chance to correct personal data and appeal the AI system's decision. Overview Consultation about use Accountability and governance Impact assessments Auditing and monitoring Transparency and explainability Human oversight / intervention Contestability Singapore Patchwork of frameworks and/or guidelines created by statutory/regulatory bodies instead of legislating. For example, the Model AI Governance Frameworks for both generative and 'traditional' AI, and the Personal Data Protection Commission has issued Advisory Guidelines on Use of Personal Data in AI Recommendation and Decision Systems. Accountability is included in the compilation of ethical principles within the Model Framework for 'Traditional' AI. Further, accountability is one of the nine dimensions under the Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI. Auditability is included in the compilation of ethical principles within the Model Framework for 'Traditional' AI. Testing and assurance is also one of the nine dimensions under the Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI. One of the two guiding principles under the Model Framework for 'Traditional' AI is for AI decisions to be explainable, transparent, and fair. Explainability and transparency are both also included in the compilation of ethical principles collated within the framework. Additionally, transparency around content provenance is one of the dimensions under the Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI. A guiding principle under the Model Framework for 'Traditional' AI is for systems to be human centric. The responsibility, accountability, and transparency principle, included in the compilation of ethical principles within the Model Framework for 'Traditional' AI, proposes making available avenues of redress for adverse individual or societal effects of an algorithmic decision system.\n\nLewis Silkin is a leading law firm with offices in London, Oxford, Cardiff, Manchester, Leeds, Belfast, Dublin and Hong Kong.

AI can improve the customer service agent workflow by suggesting answers to common questions, summarizing calls to streamline tasks and offering customer history and information for a personalized experience. At Cisco, its AI Assistant will be \"everywhere,\" according to the company's EVP & GM of Security and Collaboration Jeetu Patel -- in security, networking, observability and collaboration.\n\n\"Every company, every application -- consumer or enterprise -- is building an assistant,\" Patel acknowledged, but added that Cisco's approach is to build a single platform as the backing for its version of the AI assistance. \"We have an AI assistant platform across all of our architectures. It manifests itself differently depending on the use case, but it is smart enough to ask the other platforms if I may what it might know,\" he said.\n\nEach discrete team at the company -- whether it's the networking team, the security team or the collaboration team -- all contribute intelligence to a \"common data lake,\" he continued. The assistant is made up of this combined intelligence, and therefore, each team has access to correlated findings that can lead to a \"unified, singular answer.\"\n\nPatel is excited about the future of AI, believing it will be part of the \"fabric of virtually everything\" and \"deployed across almost every piece of technology.\" However, he emphasized that there is a current state of \"uncertainty\" surrounding AI's long-term impact on things like the job market, the potential for increased bias and how the data will be used.\n\n\"The potential for increased bias emphasizes the need for clear guidelines and ethical AI development to ensure a fair and beneficial integration of AI into the workforce, and organizations must keep their customers' trust with regard to safeguarding their data and information,\" he cautioned. \"When integrating technologies like AI, it is essential that leaders and key decision makers keep top of mind their responsibility to mitigate potential harm and maintain trust for employees, partners and customers.\" At Cisco, this burden of responsibility has taken the form of a set of principles that outline its commitment to AI governance with a focus on security, privacy and human rights.\n\n\"I believe there will be a time when every job will have an AI assistant that helps people be more productive, more knowledgeable and more thorough in the body of work they do,\" said Patel.", "source": {"uri": "rcrwireless.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RCR Wireless News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "catherine_sbeglia_nin@rcrwireless.com", "name": "Catherine Sbeglia Nin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outline (list)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.rcrwireless.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/180635126_m_normal_none.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

According to the survey, 73% of respondents said they expected to be able to accomplish more in less time using AI tools, while 76% believe they would have information or insight they couldn't access previously.\n\nThe figures were 20 points higher among leadership figures surveyed, suggesting even more enthusiasm for AI among corporate leaders.\n\nWhat that means from a practical perspective, however, differs across job functions. In finance, corporate leadership predicted AI could cut down time spent on core accounting, record keeping, and expense management, while in HR it could be used to create job descriptions, training employees, and creating internal policies.\n\nFor IT, AI could be applied to managing databases, respondents said, as well as improving business productivity and solving employee IT tickets.\n\nStaff motivation was worth considering, Workday said, with the report noting that unengaged employees were named as the biggest barrier to productivity. There have long been calls for a six-hour workday rather than a four-day work week, but Workday suggests the way to boost staff morale is removing mundane, repetitive tasks.\n\nAccording to the survey, two-thirds of employees believe AI would let them expand the scope of tasks they can complete, while just over half believe AI tools would let them improve their career development and access further opportunities. Again, leadership tracked twenty points higher for each question.\n\nMore widely, Workday argues that AI should be used carefully, applied with true understanding where it makes sense.\n\n\"Implementing AI effectively calls for a nuanced examination of the levers impacting productivity,\" said Tim Wakeford, vice president of financials product strategy at Workday, in the report's introduction.\n\n\"It requires uncovering and shaping employee and leadership sentiment toward the technology across departments with much to gain, for example, those which feature in this study - finance, IT and HR.\n\n\"And it demands an open exploration of the use cases for which AI is (and isn't) suited.\"\n\nIndeed, the report found that trust was key to AI adoption. That's a serious challenge for AI developers to overcome, as 93% of those surveyed -- across employees and leadership -- said they have concerns about AI trustworthiness.\n\n\"We encourage businesses to take a two-pronged approach when it comes to deploying AI: a concrete analysis of the efficiencies AI can drive, alongside a transparent strategy to tackle the material and cultural barriers to its adoption,\" said Pell.\n\nThe survey from Workday aligns closely with alternative research on AI-related productivity benefits. In May, Microsoft reported that sluggish AI adoption rates across the UK could cost the country around \u00a3150 million in lost productivity.\n\nAnother study from PwC noted that productivity is booming in sectors where AI adoption is accelerating.

Imagine this: you're planning a vacation online. You start by outlining your ideal trip - a beachside resort teeming with children's activities and near historical landmarks. Almost instantly, a customized list of options that perfectly align with your preferences is presented to you. The days of sifting through endless search results or compromising on your plans are over.\n\nThis scenario merely scratches the surface of what organizations can do to enhance customer engagements and tailor operations to the evolving preferences and behaviors of modern consumers. This forms the core of our exploration into the role of Generation AI in the consumer service industry, setting a new standard for customer experience.\n\nAs Generative AI continually permeates various aspects of human lives, it is only logical for consumers to expect its incorporation across services they use, from banking and finance to healthcare. By integrating Gen AI into their business frameworks, industries can tap into new avenues for growth. Let's delve deeper into the influence of Gen AI across three key consumer service sectors. For instance, in the financial services sector, AI can revolutionize wealth management, scale up financial advisors' businesses, optimize portfolios, and make tailored product recommendations. It can also personalize client communication and develop smart customer service chatbots. Moreover, AI can play a significant role in risk modeling, fraud detection, and automated credit decisioning. For instance, large asset managers can leverage AI-powered investment research toolsets for informed decision making. Additionally, AI can boost the efficiency of data scientists by enabling them to rapidly interpret data and drive key business decisions.\n\nIn healthcare, uncovering the role of Gen AI in healthcare services reveals potential benefits, addresses ethical considerations, and promises improved treatment outcomes though enhanced diagnostic accuracy and automation of routine tasks. In the healthcare industry, AI can be a powerful tool for improving predictive accuracy in areas such as medication demand forecasting. By utilizing key data inputs such as sales data, disease trends, search trends, and travel patterns, AI technologies can significantly enhance forecast accuracy, resulting in substantial cost savings. Similarly, in the BioPharma sector, AI can be used to streamline and optimize processes. For instance, AI can help in creating medical marketing content while ensuring adherence to legal and medical standards. The use of AI in this context can drastically increase content productivity, making it a valuable tool in the industry.\n\nIn the travel industry, Gen AI is transitioning the focus from merely the destination to the overall experience. An AI-powered tool can pair travelers with the perfect accommodation and destination by understanding their natural language searches detailing their preferred holiday experiences. This sophisticated search function can incorporate individual travelers' preferences, offering a tailored travel experience. Across these sectors GenAI is also enabling rapid modernization of legacy systems running on mainframes, monoliths etc., unlocking new customer experiences and making business more agile in responding to customer needs.\n\nGenAI for a Competitive Edge\n\nAs markets evolve, competition intensifies. Consumer service organizations can capitalize on GenAI's ability to deliver personalized experiences, streamline service provision, and drive data-informed decisions. Doing so not only refines operations and amplifies customer interactions but also uncovers invaluable insights, carving out a distinct competitive edge for these organizations in a rapidly changing market. Understanding user behavior is now more intuitive with LLMs, which capture granular details of customer preferences. Gen AI provides comprehensive insights into customer behavior, revealing not only actions but also the underlying motivations behind their choices.\n\nRather than reinventing the wheel, GenAI optimizes existing systems and technological investments. By streamlining processes and enhancing efficiency without major overhauls, logistics companies use GenAI to optimize delivery routes, reducing fuel costs and improving delivery times, thereby maximizing current resources and operational performance. Moreover, GenAI's sentiment analysis and customer journey mapping pinpoint previously untapped customer segments. For instance, a prominent audio streaming service provider experienced a substantial surge in user engagement by strategically pivoting to GenAI. Innovations such as the AI Voice Translation, powered by Google Cloud's Vertex AI and OpenAI, empowered the platform to gain profound insights into user preferences, thereby identifying and targeting new market segments effectively.\n\nStrategic Implementation Planning for Success\n\nGenerative AI pushes consumer service enterprises to the front-line of innovation. However, the speed at which generative AI technology is developing isn't making this task any easier. Agile organizations that swiftly identify and deftly tackle these implementation challenges, armed with robust mitigation strategies, ensure a seamless integration process, ultimately unlocking the potential of GenAI. A critical aspect is human intervention, especially in addressing AI hallucinations, where the AI might generate incorrect or misleading information. Human oversight is vital not only in verifying AI outputs but also in guiding the AI's learning process to align with organizational goals.\n\nInvesting in comprehensive training programs for people is essential; by equipping teams with the knowledge and skills to work effectively with GenAI, organizations can foster a collaborative environment where human expertise and AI capabilities complement each other. Ensuring data quality, security, and governance will enable GenAI to function optimally, providing reliable and valuable insights. Continuous monitoring and feedback loops allow for the ongoing assessment of GenAI's performance and the prompt implementation of improvements. This iterative process, supported by human oversight, helps organizations adapt to evolving challenges and maximize the benefits of GenAI.\n\nTransforming Customer Engagement and Industry Innovation\n\nThe integration of GenAI in the consumer service industry is a game-changer, enabling companies to better understand and cater to modern consumer preferences in a more efficient manner. The ability to interact with the technology in a natural language breaks the tech barrier for consumers, unlocking the transformative power of AI.

Should the role of the data protection regulator be expanded to cover AI, should there be a separate AI authority, or do we take a multi-sectoral approach to AI regulation?\n\n\"Whether they like it or not, Data Protection Authorities are already AI regulators\", Lucas Borges de Carvalho, an advisor to ANPD (Brazil's data protection authority) said, speaking at CPDP LatAm in Rio de Janeiro on 17th July 2024. He added that \"existing laws, especially data protection laws, apply to AI systems\".\n\nBarbara Lazarotto from Law, Science, Technology & Society (LSTS) of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) concurred adding that, \"everything that touches personal data is going to be under the Data Protection Authority (DPA).\" For the same reason, Alberto Cerda from CE3, University of Chile believes that, in Chile, \"The road to enforcement (in case of AI) will be the Data Protection Authority\".\n\nBorges de Carvalho emphasised the strong connection between AI and data protection laws, saying that AI systems need a massive amount of personal data, and systems using personal data are classified as high risk. In the EU, many topics classified as high risk involve personal data, like job selection, schools and education, migration related systems etc. \"If you consider that AI systems use personal data, and we have the tools that help answer these issues.\"\n\nThe tools that data protection regulations provide to deal with risks and harms, Borges de Carvalho added, include data protection principles like data minimisation, data protection impact assessment, purpose limitation and data subject rights (among others), as restrictions that data protection regulations place on AI companies. \"If correctly applied to AI systems, these should help establish values that they need to comply with, and understand the impact on people and society\", Borges de Carvalho said. Pedro Martins from Data Privacy (Brazil) also highlighted the need for Risk assessment, transparency, an accountability framework, the publishing of impact assessment, and legitimate assessment for usage of personal data in AI systems, and identifying \"What should data processors do when they're processing personal data (for AI)?\"\n\n\"Data protection authorities have already assumed a central role in AI regulation\", he said, giving the examples of the Clearview case in the EU, the Italian Data Protection Officer's preliminary order against ChatGPT and the Brazilian DPA's order against Meta as examples of data protection officers already getting involved in AI regulation. \"It is important\", he added, \"to provide legal certainty and balance between innovation and the guarantee of fundamental rights.\"\n\nHowever, data protection authorities face challenges while overseeing AI regulations. \"DPAs don't have the money or expertise to supervise these kinds of technologies. They have problems with independence and are short of funds,\" Barbara Lazarotto explained.\n\nIn this context it's important to remember that one key failure of India's Data Protection Law is that is exempts publicly available personal data from the coverage of this law, thereby giving online services a free-run, at least when it comes to privacy and data protection, in scraping personal data from the internet.\n\nPedro Martins of Data Privacy (Brazil) felt that the same language that we use for data protection should be used for AI as well. We have to consider it important, he said, that \"technology doesn't harm fundamental rights, or create power imbalances, or create further vulnerability.\" AI impacts fundamental rights, he said, even without using personal data.\n\nWe cannot ignore identifiability as a criteria for impact, Martins said. \"AI is a technology that blows this debate right open. We need to advance the language that we use about data governance. It has to be developed and applied in a way that we value human rights.\"\n\nWho deals with Non-Personal Data? While data protection and personal data is a big part of AI, \"the (EU) AI Act, is much more than that,\" Lazarotto said. Cerda pointed towards the non-personal data aspect of AI, pointing out that \"We're using AI to manage water resources, traffic control, recycling industrial waste. This is not about personal information. Will the Data Protection Authority be prepared to deal with enforcement of law regarding non personal data?\" he asked. \"Tomorrow you'll have autonomous cars driving, and consumer protection authority (looking into this), it can become messy.\"\n\n\"We need a coordinating authority and a mechanism, so that we don't need to go through the messy practice of lack of enforcement\", Cerda said. The law introduced in Chile \"has a technical advisory board, which is a multistakeholder entity that advises the Minister of Science and Technology regarding going further than the text of the law.\"\n\nIn Brazil, Medon added that there is a multi-sectoral approach to regulating AI: sectoral bodies will be a part of this commission, and a committee and council will be created, which will include the Brazillian DPA. \"There is a very strong argument, if we build from scratch, it will be harder.\" Martins added that, for Brazil, \"We have to have the ministry of labour as a stakeholder. There is environmental impact of AI and its infrastructure. We need to make sure that AI developments consider climate justice. Copyright is also something is being discussed.\"\n\nMartins added that Brazil and maybe global south as a whole is beginning to see systemic issues of discrimination, and exploitation of labour, which are issues related to AI. A multisectoral approach is important, with civic participation. These cannot be abandoned for AI regulations.\"\n\nBrazil created an AI legislation in 2020, with some urgency, but, \"It had no clear responsibilities or sanctions and didn't tackle enforcement of the AI bill. The senate realised that the bill was incapable of dealing with it,\" Filipe Medon from CTS-FGV (Brazil) explained. The new Bill (2338) takes a human centric approach to AI, and takes both a risk based approach and a rights based approach to AI regulation. \"This did not please the private sector, on the grounds that it provided extreme measures that could stifle innovation. There's now a new committee, and the discussions are still taking place.\"\n\nIn Chile, the new law is similar to the EU standards, with explainability and transparency, with identification of levels of risk and mitigative and preventive measures. \"The law also states a regime of infraction and monetary fines in case of infringement.\"\n\n\"An AI Act shouldn't be motherhood and apple pie. Are people capable of enforcement? In terms of law in action versus law in the books?\" Medon asked.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSTAY ON TOP OF TECH NEWS: Our daily newsletter with the top story of the day from MediaNama, delivered to your inbox before 9 AM.

Getting Consumers To Buy It", "body": "Ask anyone in the street about AI and you'll probably hear about job losses and the Terminator-style dangers of the technology in the future. That kind of intelligence is still some way off, perhaps many decades. For now, many are likening this birth of AI to that of the Internet in terms of the changes to come. The real issues, though, are getting consumers to actually pay more for AI enabled devices when at present, the benefits are somewhat limited.\n\nChicken and egg scenarios come to mind. but the immediate future is an exciting mix of highly useful tools from real-time translation, medical advances and dramatic improvements to tools available to content creators that use PC devices and smartphones.\n\nI was at an AI-focussed conference with AMD and some of Europe's leading PC journalists recently and there were a few seismic facts that were made very clear. AMD, for example, is making huge shifts in the way it's manpower is focussed. Software support and optimization is absolutely key with many areas of the PC industry - it's something Nvidia, for example, has done consistently well through massive investment.\n\nAMD is looking to close that gap. It is trebling its software arm specifically to deal with AI. That is a massive shift however you look at it, but is evidence of the magnitude of the changes to come over the next few years as the goal of processing AI tasks locally on your devices rather than the cloud, becomes the norm.\n\nAI neural processing units (NPUs) will be on most PCs within just a few years and have been the talk of recent tech events such as Computex where the likes of AMD, Intel and Qualcomm revealed their latest AI hardware. In many ways it's like the move to multi-core processors. These days, you'd find it hard to buy desktop PCs or laptops with fewer than four cores. However, 15 years ago single-core processors were common.\n\nThe measure of AI horsepower is trillions or tera operations per second (TOPS). Currently, flagship processors have around 45 TOPS, with AMD's Ryzen AI 300 series Strix Point processors offering a lavish 50 - more than enough to meet the 40 TOPS requirement for Microsoft's Copilot+ for example. That is set to increase significantly over the next few generations of NPU-enabled devices.\n\nThere's no denying that whatever company you opt for, a laptop with a cutting-edge NPU is going to cost several hundred bucks more than a standard model. Right now, I'd wager that the benefits in AI-based tasks are simply not known to your average consumer that's in the market for a $1,500-2000 laptop.\n\nEven those that frequent tech review sites don't seem to want to fork out the extra cash for AI features as revealed in a recent poll on TechPowerUp. Over 80 percent of those that responded said they would not pay extra for AI hardware.\n\nThe comments in the forum thread were a little more mixed, with some saying current hardware isn't powerful enough to deal with the tasks they currently rely on cloud-based services for and others being more positive and saying many of the negative comments were not fully up to speed on the current capabilities of AI. I'd have to agree with that given several forum members said AI is non existent in gaming and content creation when that's absolutely not the case as they're both seeing AI being implemented and on a soon to be massive scale.\n\nPersonally I use AI on a daily basis, primarily to aid content creation through apps such as Canva, Photoshop and Photoroom. These are largely cloud-based and as a result, can be painfully slow and of course if you don't have an internet connection, most of that functionality won't work at all.\n\nWe've just touched on one of the big benefits to having AI perform tasks locally rather than using a cloud service - the facts it could be much faster and would not require an Internet connection. Cloud-based AI also involves sending your data to the could, which in addition to slowing down the whole process, can have privacy issues too so locally processing those tasks would be more secure.\n\nBut locally processing these tasks is just one side of the benefits. The NPUs are able to do lots of tasks far more efficiently than your CPU or dedicated GPU, drawing less power. This means that laptops with NPUs can be more powerful in many ways than a CPU-only laptop, but do AI tasks using less power both with a CPU or GPU. A dedicated graphics card can still handle AI tasks, but will consume more power doing so. This is one reason NPUs are unlikely to make their way to desktop PCs where battery life and temperatures aren't vital considerations. For now, GPUs handle AI tasks just fine.\n\nThe result of an NPU drawing less power means reduced heat and power consumption and in turn, AI laptops can dramatically increase battery life - we're talking 20+ hours here - and can be designed to be much thinner as they require less cooling. In turn, they are also able to be much lighter. A thinner, lighter laptop with better battery life is a far more attractive prospect than simply an AI laptop and I certainly found myself drooling over the latest models using Qualcomm and AMD NPUs for this reason.\n\nThe funny thing here is that if lightness, portability and battery life are your primary concerns, you might even end up adding an AI laptop to your shortlist without specifically looking for one and these benefits could help kick-start take up too.\n\nOne thing is sure, though, which is that AI on our devices is most definitely not a fad. The billions of dollars being spent on developing the software and hardware flies in the face of any ignorance and pessimism of the benefits of AI and while AI services are still dominated by the cloud, the buzz words coming from nearly all companies involved with consumer-focussed AI in 2024 is enabling AI at the edge. In other words, having NPUs inside our devices to process AI tasks locally instead of sending data to and from the cloud.\n\nFrom what I've seen this year, the benefits are clear and obvious, even if the software lags behind in some areas at present. Lots of software isn't able to take advantage of local hardware for AI tasks or still requires an Internet connection and when it comes to new AI platforms such as the ARM-based Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite, Adobe's Premiere Pro video editing software cannot yet run natively on ARM-based Windows devices, although Adobe is working on this.\n\nPlugging these holes will happen, though, and it's likely the NPU will be talked about just as much as CPUs and GPUs in terms of specifications from here onwards.

He welcomes three speakers from Clyde and Co's Dispute Resolution Group around the world: Alexandra Lester, Partner in the Middle East, Marc Voses, Partner in New York, and Dr Florian P\u00f6tzlberger, Counsel in Munich.\n\nThis episode kicks off with the key trends relating to Generative AI litigation, before discussing the main legal challenges and risks of using the technology. Guests then explore how regulation is evolving to help manage these risks and encourage innovation, concluding with a look at the measures clients should take to avoid facing legal action.\n\nWilliams describes GenAI as the \"new kid on the block\" of AI, and thus the courts are grappling with the issue, with cases primarily consisting of: \"what happens when AI gets it wrong?\" or what happens when it uses someone else's original work without permission. Voses outlines several cases where AI has gone awry, including the \"horrific\" Murphy Murphy vs EssilorLuxottica involving a man who was wrongly sent to prison for theft due to faulty technology.\n\nP\u00f6tzlberger expands on the IP and copyright theme, stating \"there are currently 24 cases pending in the US,\" including high-profile examples, such as The New York Times vs. Open AI and Microsoft. P\u00f6tzlberger then discusses the case of Getty Images vs Stability AI in more detail, in which the judge determined within a preliminary judgment that \"the claimant had a real prospect of success....\" for its claim for IP infringement. Voses also mentions Scarlett Johansson versus OpenAI, which caused the AI product to be \"promptly shut down,\" noting: \"There's been some pretty good success by those looking to limit its (genAI's) use.\"\n\nOn the legal risks of using GenAI, Lester raises the reliability of outputs, citing an Australian case where \"a group of academics had to apologise after submitting fake evidence to an Australian Parliamentary inquiry...\" This serves to highlight the critical importance of verifying AI outputs, and using trusted, industry specific tools. Attributing AI authorship is another key challenge is, with a range of approaches currently being taken around the world. Furthermore, there is a real danger of biased or discriminatory genAI outputs, due to training with incomplete data sets: \"So if you train a facial recognition system on a data set that only includes light skin faces, then obviously that AI will perform better when dealing with light skin faces...,\" explains Lester.\n\nTurning to regulation, P\u00f6tzlberger provides a high-level view, spanning the world's first genAI regulation in China, and the EU AI Act approved in May this year. In the US, Colorado has recently enacted the Consumer Protections for Artificial Intelligence Act, which will come into effect in 2026. And, while the Middle East is yet to pass any AI specific legislation, Lester mentions that \"the DIFC courts in Dubai and the United Arab Emirates have issued guidance on the use of AI in (court) proceedings,\" noting that countries around the world are following suit.\n\nWhat measures should clients take to mitigate the risk of AI litigation? For Voses, they should aim to build \"a culture of AI risk management,\" including robust protocols and in-house policies, while Lester stresses the role of due diligence when selecting an AI provider, ensuring a watertight contract is in place. Added to this, P\u00f6tzlberger notes that reviewing insurance policies for AI coverage is critical, as is remaining cognisant of IP and data protection rights and ensuring transparency in use of AI-generated materials.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

CrowdStrike's stock plunged 11% today. Not more? Dan Primack notes that's because it's now seen as \"integral to the entire internet.\"\n\nRaising the stakes for CrowdStrike, consolidation is continuing in cybersecurity. Alphabet may buy Wiz, as big tech companies such as Google and Cisco look to make a play in cybersecurity versus pure plays.\n\nAlso on the acquisition front, GitLab reportedly could get bought by Datadog. DevSecOps and observability may be a good match, though with a market cap of $8.5 billion now, GitLab would be a big gulp for Datadog, so a deal isn't certain. Other exits such as initial public offerings remain scarce, which makes OneStream's IPO plans interesting: Is it a one-shot wonder or will it open up software-as-a-service company offerings?\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence got the side eye this week from a number of quarters, but big money keeps rolling in. It's certainly juicing the profits of chip and server makers, as Gartner just upped its server market forecast on gen AI business. Meantime, OpenAI is apparently talking with Broadcom to design an AI chip. At the same time, though further restrictions this week on chip tech going to China tanked semiconductor stocks.\n\nAnd then there was Elon Musk, who said he will move X and SpaceX from California to Texas, using what's surely an economic decision to make political attacks. Speaking of Musk, he and his cronies Marc Andreessen, David Sacks, Peter Thiel and a few others giving millions to Trump got a lot of coverage. I don't believe this is core Silicon Valley by any means, and a survey by The Information shows tech folks favor Biden 59% to 27%, so take the stories of a conservative wave in the Valley with a grain of salt -- these folks were always leaning Trump.\n\nNext week, tech earnings season gets underway with a raft of big names, including SAP, NXP Semiconductor, Alphabet, Tesla, IBM, Check Point Software and Juniper Networks.\n\nThis and other news will be discussed in depth on John Furrier's and Dave Vellante's weekly podcast theCUBE Pod, out this afternoon on YouTube. Also, don't miss Vellante's weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, due out this weekend.\n\nAnd the following week is our own editorial event, Supercloud 7: Get Ready for the Next Data Platform.

Many companies are simply applying AI labels on their products to give the impression of being cutting-edge, with lofty claims about AI capabilities that are unlikely as advanced as they say, nor do they deliver business value or tangible outcomes. This can be extremely misleading for consumers who don't understand the technology. There's a learning curve needed for everyone, from enterprise IT to the average consumer, to understand what AI is and what it is not. Consumers interested in financial apps with AI capabilities, for example, will want to ensure they are getting what they bargained for.\n\nAI washing poses significant risks for companies. There's potential for regulatory fines and a risk of reputational damage in the marketplace. Government regulators are keenly aware of AI washing and have already taken action against some businesses for overselling their AI capabilities. The Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have both warned companies about making false claims about AI.\n\nWhat practical steps can companies take to implement effective AI governance and compliance?\n\nFirst, companies need trusted, unified data -- in real time. Second, companies should be transparent about their data, ensure data quality, accurately present data-driven insights, and prioritize data privacy and security. Third, companies should ensure their customers have full control over their data and that the platform provides full transparency and audit on any changes to the data. Customers should always know what data is being used by a company's AI-enabled capabilities.\n\nBeyond that, consumers, researchers, and regulators should also critically evaluate AI claims and demand transparency to hold companies accountable for their AI assertions. Additionally, it's important to provide clear information about data sources, processing methods, and AI model outcomes.\n\nHow are AI and automation transforming data management, and why is this a business imperative?\n\nAI and automation are revolutionizing data management, significantly improving the time-to-value and enabling businesses to become data driven faster than ever. The introduction of LLM-powered, pre-trained machine learning features for entity resolution, for example, is transforming how businesses handle data unification. Reltio's Flexible Entity Resolution Networks (FERN), for example, uses LLM-powered pre-trained models for rule-free matching with high accuracy. This innovative approach eliminates the need for extensive rule configuration, significantly reducing the effort and time required for data unification. The pre-trained models, incorporating zero-shot learning, suggest matches out-of-the-box with greater precision, boosting data team productivity and shortening implementation time.\n\nThere is also increased productivity for data stewards as they can resolve issues much faster and spend more time on value-added activities and less time \"fixing data.\" The Reltio Intelligent Assistant (RIA) for example, leverages generative AI and natural language technology, providing a natural language, chat-based interface integrated within the Reltio platform. This feature enables users to search digital content, including complex technical concepts, more efficiently. By delivering answers to complex technical questions quickly, RIA amplifies data stewards' productivity, allowing them to focus on critical issues that improve data accuracy and drive the curation of high-quality data.\n\nAI-powered data unification and management capabilities reduce the hundreds of person-hours previously required to define, configure, and iterate match rules. The automation of these tasks results in significant cost savings and allows businesses to allocate resources more strategically. With higher match accuracy and minimal effort required, companies can achieve better results with less manual intervention. AI and automation in data management enhance accuracy, simplify processes, boost productivity, reduce costs, and provide a strategic advantage. These benefits make the adoption of AI-driven data management solutions a business imperative, enabling companies to leverage their data more effectively and stay ahead in a competitive landscape.\n\nWhich specific trends in your industry are you most excited about?\n\nThe industry trend I'm most excited about is the intense enterprise focus on feeding AI with trusted, unified data to fuel their business initiatives. Without clean, connected, interoperable data, investments in AI are wasted. Diving into AI without a solid data foundation presents risks for failure. That's why we're seeing increasing interest in data unification and management solutions to deliver trusted data that can be used across the enterprise to unlock digital transformation and empower organizations to fully leverage the power of AI.\n\nDo you have any unique predictions on the outlook of your industry?\n\nApplications as we know them are going away as AI will open up the reinvention of the entire landscape. The current UI-based applications will soon be obsolete and replaced by AI-based conversational experiences. No one will need to go into an application to enter data or search for it. This can be done via a conversational AI experience where you ask a question using natural language. While conversational UX has been around for a while, we now have a usable technology (GenAI UX) to make it real. A natural language question can be used to update data, query data, outline a business intelligence report, and route a request, among other time-saving tasks.

I'm in a series of three dogfights on a simulator and the results are not good.\n\nThat annoying little image won't leave my six o'clock position, and I lose 3-0 to the ominous black triangle.\n\nThe ace I'm up against is an AI dogfighter developed by Turkish aerospace engineers commissioned by defence giant BAE Systems.\n\nThey've been working on an AI co-pilot that could save a real life aviator in a dogfight, and will find its way into sophisticated warfighting simulators.\n\nOne of the engineers, Emre Saldiran, is studying at Cranfield University in the UK, which has strong aerospace links. He describes how the AI co-pilot picked up fighting tactics by a process of trial and error. \"We reinforce the AI's learning with more and more data put into the dogfight simulator.\"\n\nOne of his objectives is to address the information overload fighter pilots endure. His colleague Mevl\u03cbt Uzun assures me that AI takes a lot of learning to beat humans. \"The AI made millions of mistakes. Teaching it is like guiding a child.\"\n\nBut once trained the AI can offer valuable advice, according to Mr Uzun.\n\n\"The AI can tell a pilot to slow down or speed up. And it can evaluate an emerging dogfight and warn of a 70% probability the pilot will lose if they get into that fight.\"\n\nSo the AI warns pilots of situations likely to end in their jet being shot down and it takes that decision in milliseconds. But the design team aren't making any big claims about it replacing a pilot.\n\n\"It's just a piece of code, you could run it on your phone,\" says Mr Uzun. Today their program is running off a normal laptop PC.\n\nThe US Air Force revealed its own, rather more elaborate, AI dogfighter in 2023. It was demonstrated flying an F-16 jet in combat manoeuvres.\n\nThis flight was the culmination of years of work aimed at creating an AI that could beat a living pilot.\n\nEight US AI companies went head to head in 2020 during a three-day competition known as the AlphaDogfight Trials Event. This involved simulated online dogfights between the competing AI programs and an experienced USAF fighter pilot.\n\nThe winning program beat the pilot repeatedly, and Brett Darcy of US defence shop Shield AI was on the three-strong team that built it.\n\nHe remembers the AlphaDogfight event vividly. \"The competitors ranged from the big boys like [defence giant] Lockheed Martin down to us.\"\n\nThey started out by pitching their AI pilot against a target flying straight and level, \"a sitting duck\" says Mr Darcy.\n\nThey progressed to fighting other AI pilots, getting the AI to think about tactics. Certain rules, such as the length of each dogfight (usually five minutes) and the maximum speed they could attain were set.\n\nBut there was no requirement to abide by USAF doctrine. \"Our AI used a head-on merge with the target as an opportunity to fire guns,\" he says.\n\nThis novel tactic went against accepted air fighting doctrine. The AI had learned to reject rules when it could spot a better move.\n\nPoints were awarded with each combat, the AI evolving to match successful outcomes. Multiple copies of the AI were generated by this evolution as the competing AI pilots measured up to each other's changing tactics.\n\nThese heats left Mr Darcy's group to oppose an experienced USAF fighter pilot wearing a VR headset that put him in the cockpit of an F-16.\n\nThanks to victories scored against that human pilot, Mr Darcy's small team was invited into the government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), which develops technology for the US Department of Defense.\n\nSpecifically, they joined Darpa's Air Combat Evolution (ACE) project.\n\nWhen Darpa's AI-driven F-16 took to the air it was controlled during combat by a distant descendant of the software Mr Darcy's team wrote in 2020.\n\nAI evolves at a startling pace. Mr Darcy says this was \"a many times removed grandson of the AlphaDogfighter AI.\"\n\nDespite a bewildering rate of development AI has a long way to go. The ACE jet has a safety pilot on board for take-off and landing who can switch off the AI at any time.\n\nFor an AI pilot to be effective it has to win a lot of trust and be able to integrate into wider forces around it.\n\nIntriguingly Mr Darcy says a big question is how an AI pilot can \"explain itself on the ground\", debriefing human controllers on its actions and motives.\n\nThe UK AI dogfighter is very thrifty compared to its US cousin. \"They are teaching the AI to fly an aircraft\" says Dr Uzun. \"We don't need to do that.\"\n\nParing the project down by concentrating on combat moves alone meant the Cranfield team worked fast. \"What they took weeks to do we did in two days.\"\n\nOne man whose career spans the rise of digital defence tools is Michael Hull. Now a principal technologist at BAE Systems in Warton, Lancashire, he joined the business as an apprentice electronics engineer in 1990.\n\nDramatic changes he has witnessed, include the way innovations that once emerged from inside defence companies now travel in the other direction. \"We pull technology like AI into defence from the public domain.\"\n\nSo, the AI dogfighter's frugal heritage includes air-to-air combat tactics downloaded from Wikipedia, leaving classified information well out of the picture and contributing to the pace of the project.\n\nHow did the quick assembly British AI dogfighter fare against a real Top Gun?\n\nBen Westoby-Brooks flew Typhoons for the RAF and works for BAE Systems. He went up against the AI dogfighter and defeated it.\n\nThe AI dogfighter is no substitute for thousands of hours flying fast jets in very demanding circumstances. But it feeds into realistic online combat exercises and could reduce pilot overload in a genuine cockpit.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

This happened as the company shifted focus from the gaming industry to a position central to the development of today's most talked-about technology: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) that power crucial AI tasks like training and inference, as well as a broad array of AI products and services. The company's expertise has helped it win 80% of the AI chip market and increase revenue and net income by triple digits in recent quarters.\n\nAll of this is fantastic, and investors have rewarded the company by piling into the shares, driving them up 2,900% over the past five years. But amid all of this excitement, one particular number could present a risk for the company and its investors. Should it be seen as a red flag and a reason to sell the stock? Let's find out.\n\nYears ago, Nvidia's chips primarily served the gaming industry, but it soon became clear that the GPU's ability to handle many tasks at once would make it useful in other areas -- in particular, AI. The company focused on building out a complete ecosystem of AI products and services, most recently moving into the areas of enterprise software and sovereign AI (which is targeted to particular countries).\n\nSo, companies and countries can turn to Nvidia for all of their AI needs. As a result, AI has emerged as Nvidia's main business in recent years, and this has driven tremendous revenue gains.\n\nToday, in just one quarter, Nvidia brings in more than double the revenue the company generated in an entire year in 2019. In that fiscal year, it reported $11.7 billion in revenue; in the most recent quarter, revenue totaled $26 billion.\n\nNow, let's talk about the figure that represents a risk for Nvidia: 86%. That's the percentage of its total revenue linked to AI, meaning the company has become heavily dependent on this business. Of the quarter's $26 billion in revenue, more than $22 billion came from the data center segment, which includes AI products and services.\n\nThis suggests that if companies lose interest in AI, and the technology doesn't take off as expected in the coming years, Nvidia's revenue prospects could be in danger. So this represents a risk, since it's impossible to guarantee the long-term success of a newish technology like AI.\n\nBut is it really a red flag that should prompt you to sell or avoid Nvidia? Not necessarily.\n\nAnalysts expect AI to grow from a $200 billion market today to more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. Even if it falls short, there is reason to be optimistic about growth still being strong enough to power revenue gains at Nvidia.\n\nThat's because AI already has proved its usefulness for some companies and organizations by generating results. We can see this in applications for Nvidia's enterprise software. For example, ControlExpert uses the platform to allow insurance companies to process motor vehicle claims in just one day, a tremendous gain in efficiency.\n\nAnd companies like Amazon, which offers Nvidia products and services through its cloud computing business Amazon Web Services (AWS), already are monetizing AI. Thanks to sales of AI tools, AWS recently reached a $100 billion annual revenue run rate. Amazon itself also uses AI, to help its e-commerce business operate more efficiently.\n\nThis bodes well for ongoing investment in AI, and that's great news for Nvidia. So, yes, the company's dependence on AI for revenue is a risk -- but it's one you can manage as an investor by diversifying your portfolio.\n\nYou can buy and hold shares of Nvidia, while also holding shares of companies that aren't AI-dependent and operate in other industries. Diversification always is a good idea. All companies and industries come with risk -- spreading your investments across a few can dilute that risk.\n\nAll of this means I wouldn't see Nvidia's dependence on AI revenue as a red flag or a sell sign today. Instead, I would take a positive view, seeing this focus on a hot technology as an opportunity for the company to potentially generate more explosive gains down the road.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adria_cimino@fool.com", "name": "Adria Cimino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enterprise software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Web Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Publicly_Traded", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Publicly Traded", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/783641/gettyimages-613345556.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Almost half (47%) of respondents expect to increase their investments in technical infrastructure to support AI over the next five years by 10%.\n\nDavid Wong, chief product officer at Thomson Reuters, said AI has the potential to automate large volumes of routine tasks, which could help the business to become more effective and efficient.\n\n\"The reason why operational changes are at the top is because savvy buyers are now really focusing on ROI, in terms of either cost savings or productivity,\" he added.\n\nAccording to Wong, the survey respondents now had a pretty clear idea of some of the areas where AI could be applied in their jobs, when comparing the latest poll with the survey conducted in 2023.\n\nHowever, many of the people polled have concerns over the use of AI. The survey shows that respondents are concerned primarily with the accuracy of outputs, and almost two-thirds of respondents agreed that data security is a vital component of responsible use.\n\nThompson Reuters said the majority of respondents would prefer to see the introduction of a certification process for AI systems, or having independent bodies create standards for use to ensure responsible AI.", "source": {"uri": "computerweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Computer Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomson Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data security"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/visuals/ComputerWeekly/Hero Images/technology-digital-binary-1-adobe.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nCFOs and their fellow executives have had lots of thoughts about how AI has and is continuing to impact their roles. For this edition of the CFO Peer Audit Series, we asked CFOs:\n\nHave you or the company provided any type of formal guidance around AI to your employees, and are you using these types of tools in your day-to-day now?\n\nHere's what finance leaders had to say.\n\nWe have some AI incorporated, but I wouldn't say it's new AI. On the finance side of things, our accounts payable and Optical character recognition technology has existed for some time. We automate some of our vendor onboarding, but I have not replaced the finance department with AI by any means. I think we are a significant way away from doing anything like that.\n\nI am always challenging my teams to find efficiency and ways to use technology, so we can spend more time doing analysis and things that move the needle versus things that are just manual processes. Overall, I would say a wholesale adoption of AI is still a long way out in finance.\n\nWe've been encouraging folks to use ChatGPT and other AI tools to the extent they need it -- we're embracing it.\n\nWe are not at the level yet where we can incorporate into our marketing campaigns with things like creating images and pictures and stuff, but we are definitely encouraging our people to explore how it can help us.\n\nThere is no sort of formal guidance per se, but one thing I've learned, and I'm a dinosaur as my kids would say, is that I love it. It's amazing how these new tools can aid the thought process and help improve what you're trying to say. But, I also think the confirmation of accuracy is super important when it comes to this stuff.\n\nI think AI has been around longer in finance and accounting than most people think. I've had AI in my accounting and finance tools for years now, and I remember going to one vendor's CFO conference every year and they were talking about the impact of AI six or seven or seven years ago.\n\nI've said that when it comes to AI, it's like the old Ronald Reagan saying: \"Trust but verify.\"\n\nI love it. I often will take analysis from the businesses and run it through ChatGPT myself to see how we could do better and to get a different perspective or wording on things.\n\nI think that the more we can optimize, the more we can spend our time doing things that are more important.\n\nWe haven't touched on that much internally. There hasn't been a lot of adoption or even talk about it within the office. I don't believe it's something we have a lot of exposure to.\n\nOur ERP system has a lot of different AI options within it, which are useful to us. But things like giving away important information on ChatGPT to the company aren't a concern for us at this point.\n\nI haven't gotten into ChatGPT myself. We run Office 365, so I've toyed around with co-pilot a bit when I needed help with something like a copy edit. But overall, like I said, it's not a concern for us right now.\n\nWe've seen a lot of benefits on the operational administrative side with these types of tools. I encourage AI use in things like email communication for instance. That stuff has been great for us, especially when we have a lot of things going on and it allows us to save time for little things like that.\n\nThe way I see it is that AI will take out people who aren't good in the market, and it has created an initiative to figure out new ways in which people can add value. I hope that AI will one day be able to enhance my firm to the point where it's easier to run, I can hire fewer employees with more output, that sort of thing.\n\nBut, there's always a value in communication in our business, working with clients, and you need someone to filter information to make sure it all applies to our clients. So I don't think people should live in fear of technology, but I do believe it should inspire them to find different ways to provide value.", "source": {"uri": "cfo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CFO"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_zaki@cfo.com", "name": "Adam Zaki", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Optical character recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounts_payable", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accounts payable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft 365"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(signal_processing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filter (signal processing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enterprise resource planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.cfo.com/imgproxy/HLeNjwinsKIetDZrPSZ4GLamd1QdATXyG_Z_kNSDihg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTExNjA5NDc0NzUuanBn.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Organizers said AI contributes to the event's unique character and relevancy, as well as making the Games fairer for its athletes, safely accessible to all its on-site visitors and more personalized for its viewers, particularly in the following five areas.\n\nSince 2018, the Olympic Games have used AI to enhance the accuracy of judging and refereeing. The 2024 Paris Games continue and improve upon Pyeongchang's use of AI as a tool for Olympic judges.\n\nWith its enhanced data comprehension and analysis capabilities, AI improves judging accuracy by providing information officials can't detect. For example, in diving, AI tracks metrics such as AI rotations or jump height with cameras, providing more complete information than the naked eye of a judge.\n\nThe goal is to ensure fairness and accuracy by employing AI to deliver verifiable information to officials that might help lead to more impartial, transparent scoring and rulings.\n\nAI plays a big and growing part in athletics, including personalized training, analyzing metrics and even scouting for talent.\n\nAI provides tools that enable Olympic athletes to train more efficiently. For example, special technology sensors on bike pedals and wearable technology monitor metrics such as heart rate, used to optimize training programs and target areas for improvement. The collected training data further helps prevent injury by identifying an athlete's movements that distress specific areas of the body.\n\nFor some sports, AI tracks movement in real time to provide tips to improve form and technique and optimize performance. AI also looks at an opponent's performance to identify strategies that provide athletes a competitive edge.\n\nMost recently, AI began scouting for talent in otherwise overlooked areas. In its partnership with Intel, the IOC examined athletic performance in children from Senegal to find promising talent. The AI algorithm can even recommend a sport for a child based on an analysis of that athlete's movements.", "source": {"uri": "techtarget.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechTarget"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diving (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wearable_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wearable technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heart rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senegal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Senegal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/ai_a311883856.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

And Barnsley Council is deploying Copilot \"at scale\", according to Microsoft. Staff across finance, HR and legal teams are using the tool. Like Derby, Barnsley is finding AI to be useful in social care.\n\nAccording to Rob Anderson, chief analyst at GlobalData, Bolton Council is another large user of Copilot. \"A few months ago, over 60 local authorities were paying Microsoft for the use of Copilot for Microsoft 365, usually for a few hundred users,\" he said. \"This number appears to be growing exponentially.\"\n\nAnderson sees local authorities deploying AI in two ways: Copilot for Microsoft 365, and through existing enterprise software packages. Derby, for example, is integrating AI into Liquidlogic, a line of business system for social care.\n\nCouncils are looking to generative AI, first and foremost, to streamline administration. As GlobalData's Anderson puts it, they are using \"intelligent cut and paste\" to move information between records and systems. They are also using it to summarise information, for example in consultation exercises. But they are also integrating generative AI with tools such as machine learning and business intelligence.\n\n\"The AI programme is a crucial element of [Derby] council's digital transformation, supporting all its operations,\" said Brammall. \"The principle of professional co-pilots is that AI is employed to do much of the \"administration heavy lifting\", freeing up professionals to focus on what only humans can do - using their expertise to solve complex problems.\"\n\nThere are risks with any AI deployment. Aside from direct security risks, such as prompt injection attacks, councils are concerned about AI hallucinations, as well as the risk of lower-level mistakes or misleading advice. Even something as simple as an inaccurate meeting summary could have serious ramifications in local government.\n\n\"The consequences of privacy and security breaches are far higher for the public sector, so, understandably, it needs to be slower and more considered in adopting AI than the private sector,\" said Radek Dymacz, head of cloud architecture at Databarracks.\n\nDerby City Council acknowledges this, and has set up an AI compliance and ethics board to monitor its roll-out. The council notes that, so far, it has had just 40 complaints out of 1.1m AI-based transactions with the public.\n\nBut public-sector bodies also need to ensure they are using the right tools for the task, including the right type of AI; this will not always be a generative AI system. \"There are some interesting use cases for better-supporting customers, such as intelligent customer support or helping users to find out information,\" said Mission Decisions' Hillier. \"However, we are seeing quite a few poorly implemented solutions that just frustrate the user.

Washington and Beijing must work together to mitigate the risks.\n\nIn 2012, DQN, an AI system developed by then-start-up DeepMind, discovered how to play classic Atari computer games with human-level skill, a major breakthrough at the time. By 2023, GPT-4 had become the most powerful and general AI model to date, showcasing the ability to ace several standardized tests, including the SAT and LSAT, pulling ahead of human doctors on several medical tasks, constructing full-scale business plans for startups, translating natural language to computer code, and producing poetry in the style of famous poets.\n\nWe haven't seen anything yet. There are several reasons to believe that AI systems will continue to become more powerful, more general, and more ubiquitous.\n\nFirst, there is the recent development and rapid improvement of machine learning algorithms known as foundation models, which take the knowledge learned from one task and apply it to other seemingly unrelated tasks. This ability makes them incredibly versatile and, thus, incredibly powerful. Large language models like GPT-4 are infant technologies that seem likely to undergo many more rounds of improvement as private and public money continue to pour into AI research. They require large amounts of data on which to train, which in turn require the appropriate hardware on which to be processed.\n\nThis brings us to our second and third reasons, which are the increasing availability of training data and the increasing sophistication of Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), advanced electronic circuits typically used to train artificial neural networks. GPU throughput, a measure of the rate at which a GPU can process data, has increased tenfold in recent years, a trend that seems likely to continue apace.\n\nFuture foundation models are likely to continue increasing in size, leading to the fourth and perhaps most fundamental reason to expect increasing power, generality, and ubiquitousness from our AI models: an arcane theory known as the scaling hypothesis. Machine learning algorithms turn inputs into outputs using scores of numerical values known as parameters, which are adjusted for accuracy as the model trains on reams of data. Under the scaling hypothesis, AI systems will continue to improve given more parameters, as well as more data and more computation, even in the absence of improvements to the algorithms themselves. In other words, bigger is better.\n\nDeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman argues that it is likely that \"orders of magnitude more compute will be used to train the largest AI models\" in the near future. Therefore, if the scaling hypothesis is true, rapid AI progress is set to continue and even accelerate for the foreseeable future.\n\nAll available evidence suggests that AI systems will continue to gain more sophisticated and more general capabilities. Both economic and national security incentives will push toward the widespread adoption of these systems by private citizens, businesses, governments, and militaries. Ignoring their potential dangers would put the United States at risk of incurring the costs of powerful AI systems pursuing unintended and destructive behaviors.\n\nThe Alignment Problem\n\nOne of these risks is the so-called alignment problem, defined by Brian Christian as \"ensuring that AI models capture our norms and values, understand what we mean or intend, and, above all, do what we want.\" To accomplish this goal, policymakers should view the problem of aligning AI as encompassing both technical and policy aspects. The technical aspect of AI alignment is the problem of programming AI systems to align their behavior with the intentions of their programmers. The policy aspect is the problem of writing regulations, creating incentives, and fostering international cooperation to ensure the implementation of best practices in safe AI development.\n\nThere are two broad ways in which AI systems have already demonstrated their susceptibility to misalignment. The first is specification gaming, which Victoria Krakovna and her co-authors define as \"a behavior that satisfies the literal specification of an objective without achieving the intended outcome.\" In such cases, the programmer misspecifies the reward function used to determine the AI system's actions, causing the system to engage in unintended behaviors. Numerous and well-documented, albeit small-scale, examples of specification gaming highlight a central difficulty in AI research. It is very difficult to specify what we do not want an AI system to do because unintended behaviors are often the product of unforeseen environmental factors. Researchers have thus far failed to find a solution to this problem.\n\nThe second way for an AI system to be misaligned is goal misgeneralization. Here, as Rohan Shah and his co-authors explain, \"the system may coherently pursue an unintended goal that agrees with the specification during training, but differs from the specification at deployment.\" In these cases, the programmer correctly specifies the goal, and the AI system successfully pursues that goal in the training environment. However, when the agent moves outside that environment, the goal fails to generalize, leading to pathological behavior. Given the unpredictability of real-world operational environments, researchers have yet to find a robust solution to this problem as well.\n\nPolicy Implications\n\nThe combination of increasingly powerful AI systems and our failure thus far to solve the alignment problem poses an unacceptable risk to humanity. This risk has been analyzed in detail elsewhere, and I will not rehash it here. However, it should be fairly obvious that finding ourselves in the presence of an incredibly intelligent and powerful system whose goals are not aligned with our own is not a desirable state of affairs. Given this risk, there are three general policies that the United States should pursue to solve both the technical and policy aspects of the AI alignment problem.\n\nOn the technical side, alignment research should be massively scaled up. This research should involve the development of so-called sandboxes and secure simulations, virtual environments in which robust AI systems can be tested before being given access to the real world. This policy requires increasing research funding through both the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense. The increased spending would allow existing AI safety researchers to scale up their projects, would help build a talent pipeline as demand for research assistants, laboratory assistants, and graduate students in the field increases, and would increase the prestige of the field, which would help attract top talent.\n\nIn 2022, there were approximately three or four hundred full-time AI safety researchers worldwide, out of approximately forty thousand AI researchers in total. Given the importance of the problem, this number is unacceptably low. Though it has likely increased in recent years with private AI labs' growing focus on safety, the problem has not yet been solved, not least because trusting those who have a commercial stake in rapidly releasing the most advanced models to the world is risky. A recent leak revealed that the safety team at OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is already cutting corners.\n\nOn the policy side, the United States should require rigorous testing of advanced AI models prior to their release, which should be in line with the latest research on how to do this most effectively. This would ensure that developers use the sandboxes and secure simulations discussed above when they are developed. Even before such techniques are discovered, developers should be required to red-team their models before their release. Red-teaming is the process by which engineers attempt to bypass the safety mechanisms of an AI system to expose its weaknesses, thereby allowing the system's designers to improve its safety. The White House's announcement of an AI Safety Institute, which would be responsible for, among other things, \"creating guidelines, tools, benchmarks, and best practices for evaluating and mitigating dangerous capabilities and conducting evaluations including red-teaming to identify and mitigate AI risk,\" was a good start. The next vital step is writing these guidelines into law, which will require congressional action.\n\nSecondly, the United States should enforce these requirements through regular audits of the most advanced models in development. This may require the creation of a federal registry of advanced AI systems, similar to the one for high-risk systems in the EU AI Act. These audits should focus on the most computationally intensive models since these are the ones that are likely to be the most powerful.\n\nThe Strategic Landscape\n\nEven if the United States implemented these policies and enforced them perfectly, it would be unable to ensure the development of safe and beneficial AI on its own. This is because there are two AI superpowers in the world: the United States and China. American policymakers will, therefore, have to work with their Chinese counterparts to tackle this problem properly. Despite their current state of geopolitical competition, there are two reasons to be optimistic about the prospect of Sino-American cooperation on this issue.\n\nFirst, both the Chinese and American governments have recognized their shared interest in developing safe, aligned AI. President Biden's executive order on AI and Senator Chuck Schumer's SAFE Innovation Framework for Artificial Intelligence both recognize AI alignment as a top priority. During their November 2023 bilateral summit, Presidents Biden and Xi both expressed concern over AI safety and reaffirmed their commitment to developing safe AI at their most recent summit in May. In the most telling sign of a recognition of a shared interest in AI alignment, both the United States and China signed the Bletchley Declaration on AI Safety, negotiated among twenty-nine countries in November 2023. The declaration explicitly identifies misalignment as a substantial risk from advanced AI, calls for further research into the problem, explicitly endorses safety testing, and commits the parties to international cooperation.", "source": {"uri": "nationalinterest.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Interest"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4",

However, alongside these advancements, a new challenge has emerged in the form of \"shadow AI.\" This term refers to the unapproved use of consumer-grade AI tools by employees within business environments. With nearly 50% of the general population using generative AI, the phenomenon of shadow AI raises critical concerns regarding data security, compliance, and privacy.\n\nOrganizations must learn to navigate the complexities of this emerging trend to safeguard their operations and maintain control over their technology infrastructure. With that in mind, here are four key strategies for organizations to combat the threats posed by shadow AI.\n\nRight now, most AI use involves a web browser where employees run the risk of sharing highly sensitive data or intellectual property. Proactive web filtering can stop the use of the online AI tools. This strategy involves using DNS (Domain Name System) filtering which is a technique used to control access to websites and online content by filtering DNS queries based on predefined criteria.\n\nIn other words, it involves intercepting DNS requests and either allowing or blocking access to specific websites or categories of websites based on policies defined by administrators. Organizations can use DNS filtering for content control to enforce acceptable use policies, restrict access to inappropriate or non-work-related content, and promote productivity and compliance.\n\nIn this specific case, IT teams can use DNS filtering to block access to AI websites such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and others. So, if organizations want to reduce the risk of their employees potentially entering confidential company information via a browser into these AI tools, then they can use DNS filtering to block access to those web pages. In this way, organizations can significantly reduce the attack surface and opportunity for losing confidential data.\n\nFor any cybersecurity threat, regular audit and compliance checks are essential for organizations to maintain adherence to security standards and regulatory requirements. These audits serve as a proactive measure to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n\nFor shadow AI, the audit process begins with assessments tailored specifically to AI tools and infrastructure, involving systematic testing and analysis to identify any weaknesses and potential entry points. Next, compliance checks ensure that AI initiatives align with industry-specific regulations and standards governing data protection and cybersecurity. These checks verify that AI systems adhere to legal requirements, such as data privacy laws and industry guidelines.\n\nAdditionally, employees must be equipped with a clear policy on AI use. Doing this fosters ethical, responsible, and consistent application of AI technologies while also protecting data privacy and facilitating compliance with regulations.\n\nAuditing and compliance checks are essential, but they are insufficient without continuous education efforts. An organization's lack of awareness makes it vulnerable to cyber-attacks and hinders recovery efforts, despite the increasing frequency and sophistication of these threats. Training and awareness are critical components of any comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, particularly regarding emerging threats like zero-days.\n\nRegular training sessions are essential to educate employees about potential security challenges. These sessions not only help employees spot threats more easily but also foster a greater understanding of the consequences of a breach. Additionally, to support policies on sanctioned AI use, employees must be educated on the dangers of shadow AI. This ensures that all AI initiatives are approved and compliant with security measures.\n\nEncouraging awareness leads to staff members gaining insights and feeling empowered to recognize and report suspicious activities. This proactive approach mitigates threats more swiftly, providing an additional and crucial layer of defence.\n\nFinally, there is no doubt that a collaborative approach strengthens any organization and a crucial component of enhancing overall cybersecurity posture. Therefore, encouraging transparency and openness is crucial for effectively managing shadow AI risks. Just like how establishing a culture where there's open communication between IT teams and employees, promotes a better understanding of security threats and protocols, the same applies to AI applications - sanctioned, shadow, and learning to tell the difference.\n\nSo, where do we go from here? With two-thirds (64%) of CEOs worrying about cybersecurity risks associated with AI and 71% of employees already having used generative AI at work -- with that number only set to increase -- there is no time to waste. Delaying the implementation of these strategies will only further expose your organization to threats. It's time to step up, acknowledge the challenges, and act.\n\nWe've featured the best identity management software.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Domain Name System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web page"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Identity management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards_and_Protocols", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards and Protocols", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zjafjw6AeTXTuuLetiazgC-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

This voice, powered by artificial intelligence, answers your questions about train schedules, helps you navigate the station, and even offers local restaurant recommendations - all in perfect, personalized detail. This isn't a scene from a futuristic film; it's the reality of AI chatbots seamlessly integrating into our daily lives.\n\nThis new era of digital companionship is fueled by significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the development of sophisticated knowledge base software. These \"brains\" behind the chat interface equip AI entities with vast stores of information, allowing them to hold surprisingly human-like conversations and perform increasingly complex tasks. But as we welcome these digital companions into our lives, we must also grapple with the complex questions they raise: What are the true capabilities and limitations of AI chat? And how will their emergence transform the future of human interaction?\n\nUnderstanding the Mechanics: The Technologies Powering AI Chat\n\nAt the heart of every AI chatbot lies a powerful synergy of technologies:\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI): This forms the chatbot's cognitive engine, allowing it to learn from data, recognize patterns, and make decisions. Machine learning, a key facet of AI, enables the chatbot to refine its responses over time, becoming more accurate and relevant with each interaction. Natural Language Processing (NLP): This technology enables the chatbot to understand and interpret the nuances of human language - from deciphering slang and idioms to recognizing subtle cues like sarcasm. Knowledgebase Software: This critical component acts as a centralized and meticulously organized library for the AI. It's within this digital repository that the chatbot can access and retrieve vast amounts of information to answer your questions, provide relevant insights, and even tailor its responses to your specific needs.\n\nThe interplay of these technologies is what allows a chatbot to seamlessly transition from discussing the weather to recommending a book, all while maintaining a conversational tone and adapting to your individual preferences.\n\nBeyond Simple Conversation: AI Chatbots Reshaping Our World\n\nThe real magic of AI chatbots lies in their versatility. No longer confined to basic customer service inquiries, they are proving their mettle across a spectrum of applications:\n\nPersonalized Learning, Powered by AI: Imagine a world where every student has access to a personalized tutor available 24/7. Platforms like Duolingo, for language learning, and Khan Academy, for a range of subjects, are already leveraging AI chatbots to tailor lessons to individual learning styles, provide instant feedback, and answer questions in a way that feels more like a conversation than a lecture. This personalized approach has the potential to revolutionize education, making it more engaging, effective, and accessible to all. Healthcare at Your Fingertips: While not a replacement for qualified medical professionals, AI chatbots are transforming how we access healthcare information and support. Babylon Health, for instance, offers a chatbot that conducts preliminary symptom checks, provides basic medical advice, and even schedules appointments, making healthcare more convenient and accessible, particularly for those in remote areas or with limited mobility. Entertainment Reimagined: AI chatbots are pushing the boundaries of creativity and entertainment. Platforms like AI Dungeon allow users to co-create interactive stories with AI, while tools like Jukebox, developed by OpenAI, can generate surprisingly realistic and original music in various styles. These applications blur the lines between passive consumption and active participation, offering new avenues for creative expression and personalized entertainment. The Evolving Landscape of Mental Health: In a world grappling with increasing stress and mental health concerns, AI chatbots like Woebot are emerging as valuable tools. Woebot, for example, provides users with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) exercises, tracks their mood, and offers support, all through a conversational interface. While not a replacement for human therapists, these tools offer a low-barrier entry point for individuals seeking mental health support and can be particularly helpful for those who might not otherwise have access to traditional therapy. Navigating the Ethical Landscape: A Future Fraught with Promise and Peril\n\nAs we integrate AI chatbots into more aspects of our lives, it's crucial to acknowledge the potential pitfalls alongside the promise:\n\nThe Empathy Gap: While AI chatbots can mimic human-like conversation, they lack genuine empathy. This raises concerns, especially in sensitive contexts like mental health support. It's critical to establish clear boundaries and ensure that users understand the limitations of AI companions. The Specter of Bias: AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on. If this data reflects existing societal biases, the chatbot may perpetuate and even amplify these biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Addressing this requires ongoing vigilance, diverse data sets, and rigorous testing to identify and mitigate bias. The Future of Work in the Age of Automation: As AI chatbots become increasingly sophisticated, concerns about job displacement, particularly in customer service and support roles, are understandable. It's essential to consider the societal impact of automation and explore avenues for retraining and reskilling workers for the jobs of the future. Shaping a Future Where AI Augments, Not Replaces, Humanity\n\nAI chatbots represent more than just a technological advancement; they are a mirror reflecting our evolving relationship with technology and a testament to our desire for seamless, personalized experiences. As we venture further into this uncharted territory, it's our responsibility to guide the development of AI in a direction that benefits all of humanity.\n\nThis requires open dialogue, ethical frameworks, and a commitment to harnessing the power of AI to create a more inclusive, equitable, and connected future - a future where AI augments our capabilities, not diminishes our humanity. The story of AI is still being written, and we have the opportunity to craft a narrative where technology empowers us to connect more deeply with each other and build a brighter future for all.\n\nRead More From Techbullion And Businesnewswire.com\n\nRelated Items:Augments, humanity Recommended for you The Symbiotic Nexus Between Humanity and Artificial Intelligence ConnectCon - A Virtual Festival to Connect Humanity!

So, he started looking into biomedical engineering, which applies engineering's problem-solving tools to biology and medicine to improve human health. His interest piqued, he dug into a senior thesis on the topic, then pursued a master's degree in biomedical engineering from Boston University and a doctorate in nuclear engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nAlong the way, Armoundas' passion for medicine grew.\n\n\"I felt like I was serving a purpose that was more meaningful,\" he said. \"Medicine became my main passion, but using engineering principles in medicine provided that meaning.\"\n\nArmoundas now studies the ways artificial intelligence, or AI, can improve health care. He is principal investigator at the Cardiovascular Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He talked about his AI work with American Heart Association News as part of \"The Experts Say,\" a series in which specialists explain how they apply what they've learned to their own lives. The following interview has been edited.\n\nHow is AI being used in the field of cardiology?\n\nWe know that AI is used in every aspect of cardiology, including in the diagnosis, classification and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. I chaired the writing committee for an American Heart Association scientific statement earlier this year where we addressed the main areas in which it is applied. Some examples of how it's used include interpreting cardiac imaging and matching genetic variants to health-related traits to better understand genetic risks for disease.\n\nWe know that AI has even exceeded the performance of medical experts in some cases when interpreting cardiac imaging. It can detect subtle, non-visually detected signatures in data to make a more accurate diagnosis.\n\nHow do you use AI in your work at Massachusetts General Hospital?\n\nMy focus is to try to improve in-hospital and out-of-hospital patient monitoring.\n\nRegarding in-hospital monitoring, we want to integrate all patient-related information available in order to make the best possible decisions with these patients. That means being able to predict and prevent adverse events.\n\nWe also aim to use AI to help determine the optimal time to discharge a patient. We don't want to keep patients longer than they should be staying or discharge them faster than they should. AI can help make those decisions. It will integrate information obtained from different sources that is dynamically changing during a patient's hospital stay, such as electrocardiograms, blood pressure and electronic health records.\n\nSince we can't have a doctor next to the patient all the time, AI can collect all this data and integrate it, see if certain parameters are being exceeded. Then it can make a recommendation, perhaps that patient X should stay one extra day.\n\nWith respect to out-of-hospital monitoring, we know many, many people use wearable devices such as smartwatches that collect data, such as whether someone is having an irregular heart rhythm. Many devices are not medical grade, so we can't fully trust these data yet, but we're heading toward better technologies.\n\nWe want to use the data these devices collect to make decisions about when a patient should be coming to the hospital. We don't want to bring someone to the hospital for a checkup without a reason, but we also don't want to bring them too late when their condition has worsened. AI can help us make better decisions about when they should come in, which could not only improve care but also reduce costs, which is another significant benefit.\n\nHow does AI account for non-measurable data, such as how a person feels?\n\nWe do need to recognize and integrate how the patient is feeling - their symptoms - into this process. We need more than a person's vital signs and how those may be fluctuating.\n\nBut there are apps that can record this by asking questions. How do you feel during or after exercise? How is your mental state? Do you have an appetite? It can be a questionnaire and the person can log into the app every day to report how they are feeling. All these states of being can be integrated with the other data we collect.\n\nDo you use AI outside of work?\n\nAI has entered every aspect of our lives, whether we know it or not.\n\nIt is used in navigation systems in the car to help us assess traffic and choose the optimal route to get somewhere. It is used to determine whether an email is spam. It is used in social media to direct our interests to certain topics. We may not pay attention to it or understand how it's being used, but it has entered our lives to stay.\n\nThe foundational principles behind AI are not new. They have been taught for many years back, but they were not called AI or machine learning. The AI research and development today is enabled by an explosion in the volume of data we collect, as well as the vastly increased computational power that is available to process these data.\n\nWhen a new technology appears, I may not use it directly in my work, but I will experiment with it. For example, I'm taking a paper I've written and I want to see how well a new application of AI can understand it, whether it can generate an accurate summary of what I wrote.\n\nI've also had discussions with my son, Alkinoos, who is a 22-year-old, second-year medical student, about a project he's doing to compare a physician's opinion in making a diagnosis to how well AI could make a correct diagnosis using the patient's symptoms, physical exam and diagnostic and lab tests. Even more importantly, he wants to know whether AI could guide the process of decision-making for a physician. Could AI help improve the prognosis or management of a case?\n\nHow might AI be used in medicine in the future?\n\nThe future is the integration of all this data. We want to take all these disparate aspects of clinical knowledge, genomics, data taken from wearable devices and electronic health records and our medical history and integrate it into systems that can make optimal predictions about a person's health.\n\nI'm fascinated by the integration of data for multi-organ systems research - that is, how medicine is starting to be addressed holistically, not focusing on a single organ problem but rather the body as a whole. For example, how a person's mental state is linked to cardiovascular disease.\n\nEach one of us is different and we need that personalized care to improve outcomes. This is the hope of AI in medicine, the transition one day to providing equitable care and improving outcomes on an individualized basis.", "source": {"uri": "heart.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.heart.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biomedical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Heart_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Heart Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cardiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_General_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts General Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_professor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associate professor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Technical_University_of_Athens", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Technical University of Athens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_investigator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Principal investigator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard Medical School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Problem solving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhythmia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arrhythmia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitoring_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monitoring (medicine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.heart.org/-/media/Images/News/2024/July-2024/0719TESAIArmoundas_SC.jpg?sc_lang=en&hash=8591D6AB3FE307807E76805D71CC7AE6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\n\nWorkday has unveiled figures that suggest AI could unleash a \u00a3119 billion productivity boost for UK enterprises. This revelation comes at a crucial time, as the nation grapples with a productivity slump that has persisted for over a decade and a half.\n\nThe report paints a picture of a country on the brink of a seismic shift in its economic landscape. With current productivity levels languishing 24% below pre-2008 projections, the promise of AI-driven efficiency gains offers a glimmer of hope for businesses and policymakers alike.\n\nAccording to the study, large businesses in the UK could save a staggering 7.9 billion employee hours annually through the strategic implementation of AI technologies.\n\nBreaking this down to an individual level, the numbers are equally impressive. Business leaders stand to save 1,117 hours per year - equivalent to 140 working days - while individual employees could reclaim 737 hours, or 92 working days.\n\n\"Sizeable productivity growth has eluded UK workplaces for over 15 years - but responsible AI has the potential to shift the paradigm,\" explained Daniel Pell, VP and country manager for UK&I at Workday.\n\nThe report's findings come at a time when political figures are also weighing in on the role of technology in governance.\n\nFormer Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair recently commented that while Britain faces economic challenges, advances in technologies like AI mean there has \"never been a better or more exciting time to be governing.\"\n\nDespite the optimistic outlook, the path to AI adoption is not without obstacles. The report highlights that 93% of both employees and business leaders harbour concerns related to trust in AI. This underscores the need for responsible AI strategies, comprehensive education, and transparent communication initiatives.\n\nOther barriers to AI adoption include fears over safety, privacy, and bias (38%), the need for more time to educate teams (34%), and lack of investment (32%). Additionally, the report identified unengaged employees (41%), lack of incentives (41%), and inadequate technology (35%) as key factors hampering organisational productivity.\n\nThe potential economic impact of AI is staggering. Based on the study's findings, an additional 2.9 hours of work per day translates to \u00a311,058 a year of added value for each average employee. With over 10 million employees in large businesses across the UK, the cumulative effect could reach \u00a3119 billion worth of productive work annually.\n\nHowever, the report also reveals a productivity paradox in the current workplace. In an 8-hour workday, employees and business leaders are genuinely productive for only 5.8 and 5.9 hours respectively -- leaving over a quarter of the day unproductive.\n\nThe promise of AI extends beyond mere time savings. By taking on mundane and repetitive tasks, AI has the potential to empower workers to focus on more meaningful and impactful work. This shift could address one of the biggest barriers to productivity identified in the report: unengaged employees.\n\nAs UK businesses stand at the crossroads of this AI revolution, the report serves as both a wake-up call and a roadmap. It suggests a two-pronged approach to AI deployment: a concrete analysis of potential efficiencies coupled with a transparent strategy to tackle adoption barriers.\n\nRealising the full potential of AI in the UK economy will require a concerted effort from businesses, policymakers, and employees alike. The successful integration of AI technologies could well determine the UK's economic trajectory for years to come.\n\nSee also: Tech executives confident in AI skills, but adoption barriers persist\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

{"uri": "2024-07-427411902", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-07-19", "time": "17:01:20", "dateTime": "2024-07-19T17:01:20Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-07-19T16:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5372549295425415, "url": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ai-market-update-q2-2024-review", "title": "AI Market Update: Q2 2024 in Review", "body": "The artificial intelligence (AI) industry has experienced both remarkable growth and turbulence in Q2.\n\nEvents such as a tech selloff on April 19, triggered by stubbornly high inflation data and the US Federal Reserve's reluctance to lower interest rates, sunk the S&P 500 (INDEXSP:INX) below 5,000 for the first time since February, highlighting the influence the sector has on the overall economy.\n\nGoldman Sachs' (NYSE:GS) prime brokerage report found that the group of companies leading the AI revolution, known as the Magnificent 7, accounted for 20.7 percent of hedge fund net exposure to US stocks following Nvidia's Q1 results on May 22.\n\nDespite setbacks, investor enthusiasm for the potential of AI technology has remained strong. Following the mid-April decline, major indexes trended steadily upward for the remainder of the quarter, reaching record-breaking closes the week ending on June 14. Further, Crunchbase data showed that AI startup funding more than doubled in Q2, indicating a strong appetite for innovation and a belief in the transformative potential of AI technology.\n\nHowever, the potential for AI monetization remains unclear and requires further exploration. Furthermore, fears of overconcentration in the semiconductor industry were compounded after an earthquake struck Taiwan at the start of the quarter, causing supply chain interruptions as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) (NYSE:TSM), the primary chip supplier for AI-focused tech companies, was forced to halt operations. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) said the earthquake would hurt the calendar quarter of its DRAM supply as its four Taiwanese locations were also affected.\n\nGary Marcus, a prominent AI researcher, expressed concerns about the potential burst of the generative AI bubble in an article published just days before the disaster. He cited issues such as lack of profitability, security concerns and overconcentration in the semiconductor industry as potential catalysts.\n\nFueling innovation: Financing and investment in the AI sector\n\nThe AI startup landscape witnessed a surge in fundraising activities in Q2.\n\nIn early April, Reuters announced Elon Musk's efforts to raise US$3 billion in a funding round that would have brought his startup xAI's total valuation to US$18 billion. The story was unconfirmed at the time; however, a US$6 billion Series B funding round was announced on xAI's website a month later, after which the company was valued at US$24 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine that could one day rival Google, held a US$62.7 million funding round that brought its valuation to US$1 billion on April 23. At the same time, the company launched Enterprise Pro, a solution designed for organizations looking to increase their productivity.\n\nAdditionally, major tech companies pursued partnerships and investments in promising AI startups, including OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. In April, OpenAI raised $300 million in funding and announced a collaboration with Reddit (NYSE:RDDT), providing the platform access to its AI technology in exchange for Reddit's content.\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) also announced its intention to collaborate with OpenAI and other startups, such as Runway and Pika Labs, aiming to bring generative AI capabilities to Adobe Premiere Pro. Similarly, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) acquisition of Datakalab was reportedly struck to enhance its product line with on-device generative AI. AI features were revealed at its World Wide Developers Conference event in June, where Apple also officially announced its partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT within iOS, iPadOS and macOS.\n\nProminent AI hardware provider NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) partnered with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to offer up to US$350,000 in Google Cloud credits to startups in NVIDIA's Inception program, a virtual incubator program designed to support and nurture AI startups.\n\nGovernments also provided various incentives to promote the development and growth of the AI industry. TSMC received a US$6.6 billion subsidy from the Commerce Department to build a production facility in Phoenix, while Micron was granted US$6.1 billion in chip grants to build factories in New York and Idaho. Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) US$28 billion chip factory, Ohio One, which could potentially be the world's largest chip factory, also received government funding.\n\nIn addition, the Canadian government has shown commitment to reinforcing the country's AI sector, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announcing a C$2.4 billion investment package from Budget 2024.\n\nAddressing Challenges in the AI Industry: Managing Investor Expectations, Quarterly Results, ROI, and Data Center Expansion\n\nWith billions of dollars at stake, the recent unveiling of AI products by tech giants has had a significant impact on their quarterly results. OpenAI's GPT-4, Google's AI-powered Chromebooks Plus, Apple's AI-powered iPad and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Copilot+ PCs have set the stage for an AI-driven revolution in consumer technology.\n\nAs an example, Dell Technologies' (NYSE:DELL) financial results for its first fiscal quarter of 2025 were objectively solid, with 6 percent revenue growth compared to last year and an increase in AI-optimized server orders and shipments. However, despite these positive results, Dell's share price fell by over 15 percent in after-hours trading, with the decline attributed to the fact that investors had expected even stronger growth from the company.\n\nAI-related revenue bolstered Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Broadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) quarterly results, with Amazon shares hitting a new record high of US$189.05 on April 11 after its Q1 earnings showed a 235 percent rise in net income year-on-year. This marked a significant milestone for the company at the time, and its share price continued to climb - as of July 16, it is trading at US$193.02.\n\nBroadcom's results for its second fiscal quarter of 2024 also showed a surge of 280 percent in AI-related revenue, and the company announced that a 10-for-1 stock split would take place on July 15.\n\nThe volatility of AI stocks was on full display toward the end of April with the industry's major players experiencing significant swings in their share prices.\n\nNVIDIA and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) led a tech selloff on April 19 when Super Micro failed to deliver a positive pre-announcement of its Q3 results. NVIDIA, a strategic collaborator of Super Micro, saw its share price fall in tandem below its 50-day moving average, and the company experienced its steepest decline since March 2020.\n\nDays later, Super Micro, which had joined the S&P 500 only one month prior, plummeted 23 percent, leading analysts to speculate whether AI's run could be showing signs of winding down. The company's results added fuel to these worries when it missed revenue estimates for Q3 and saw its shares drop 14 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nDespite the earlier challenges, NVIDIA had its best weekly performance in almost a year during the week that ended on April 26, when its share price rallied 15 percent on the heels of quarterly reports released by Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft and Alphabet. All three companies announced plans to spend more on AI in the coming year; however, only Meta -- whose Q1 results were released in close succession to Llama 3 and the addition of multimodal AI to its Ray-Ban Smart Glasses -- saw a drop in share price due to weaker Q2 revenue guidance coupled with higher expenditure. The stock's price fell by 14.74 percent.\n\nAlphabet announced its first dividend and a US$70 billion stock buyback upon the release of its Q1 results, bringing its share price up by 10 percent and driving the market cap above US$2 trillion, its highest valuation since November 2021.\n\nApple and Microsoft also reported strong financial performances. Apple's Q2 results included a record-breaking US$110 billion share buyback program, demonstrating the company's commitment to shareholder value. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Q3 results revealed a robust 17 percent year-over-year revenue increase.\n\nNVIDIA's upward trend continued as it announced Q1 2024 results and a June 7 stock split -- potentially making it eligible for a spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- on May 22. Subsequently, NVIDIA surpassed Apple as the second most valuable company on June 5, achieving a market cap of US$3.02 trillion.\n\nRising Challenges: Chip Shortage, Geopolitical Tensions, and Power Consumption\n\nThe rapid growth of AI and the increasing demand for data-intensive applications have led to a surge in data center construction and a significant increase in electrical utility demand. Rene Haas, CEO of Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), told Bloomberg that AI computing's energy consumption is projected to surpass the electrical use of India by 2030.\n\nWith those dynamics in mind, Amazon and Alphabet have announced significant investments in data center infrastructure, with Amazon investing US$11 billion in Indiana and Alphabet planning a US$3 billion investment for data centers in Indiana and Virginia.\n\nThese data centers require vast amounts of energy to power their servers, cooling systems and other infrastructure, contributing to the overall strain on electrical grids. As AI continues to advance and more data-driven technologies emerge, the demand for electrical power by data centers is expected to further escalate, with South Korean electrical equipment manufacturers such as Hyundai (KRX:005380), Hyosung (KRX:004800) and LS Electric (KRX:010120) witnessing significant gains in their share prices as a result.\n\nHowever, the demand poses challenges to energy providers and necessitates innovative solutions for sustainable power generation and distribution, prompting the establishment of the Federal AI Safety and Security Board. The board is comprised of prominent figures like NVIDIA's Jensen Huang and OpenAI's Sam Altman, who will help guide the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies, including addressing the associated challenges of increased electricity consumption.\n\nThe subsequent surge in power consumption has brought the energy efficiency of computer chips into sharper focus. Google, for instance, unveiled Axion, an Arm-based data center processor, aimed at improving energy efficiency in data centers, along with a new version of its own AI chip.\n\nThe push for efficiency extends to the manufacturing process as well. TSMC is planning a new generation of technology called A16, which is expected during the second half of 2026. The company says the technology will allow it to produce chips without using ASML's (NASDAQ:ASML) High NA EUV machine, which can reportedly build powerful chips more efficiently.\n\nTSMC also had a good quarter, reporting its fastest monthly revenue growth since 2022 in March. The chipmaker's Q1 results, released on April 18, beat market expectations in quarterly net profit by 9 percent, with growth expected to continue as demand for chips increases.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nOverall, the second quarter of 2024 has been marked by notable developments in the technology sector. While companies reported strong financial results, the industry faces antitrust lawsuits across various jurisdictions. The outcomes of these legal proceedings and the potential impact on the competitive landscape remain to be seen, emphasizing the importance of monitoring the evolving regulatory environment in the coming months.\n\nDon't forget to follow us @INN_Technology for real-time news updates!\n\nSecurities Disclosure: I, Meagen Seatter, hold no direct investment interest in any company mentioned in this

These vulnerabilities could be exploited to gain access to customer data and access tokens.\n\nFurthermore, attackers could gain cluster administrator privileges on SAP AI Core's Kubernetes cluster by exploiting an exposed Helm package manager server. This access could be used to steal sensitive data, such as models, datasets, and code, or to tamper with AI data and manipulate model inference.\n\nWiz highlighted that the security flaws arise from the platform's inadequate isolation and sandboxing mechanisms, which make it feasible to run malicious AI models and training procedures. This issue is common among newer AI service providers like Hugging Face and Replicate, which often rely on containerization instead of more robust isolation techniques used by veteran cloud providers.\n\nThe vulnerabilities also underscore the importance of tenant isolation and proper security practices for AI service providers. Organizations should ensure they run trusted AI models from reliable sources and verify the tenant-isolation architecture of their AI service providers.\n\nThese findings coincide with a report from Netskope that highlights the increased use of generative AI in enterprises, prompting the implementation of controls to mitigate risks associated with sharing sensitive data with AI applications.\n\nAdditionally, the emergence of a new cybercriminal group, NullBulge, has targeted AI- and gaming-focused entities since April 2024, aiming to steal sensitive data and sell compromised OpenAI API keys in underground forums.\n\nThe ongoing efforts to identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities are crucial for enhancing the security of AI platforms and protecting customer data.", "source": {"uri": "cloudways.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cloudways"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kubernetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_token", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Access token"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Package manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superuser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugging_Face", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hugging Face"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sandbox (computer security)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion_Detection_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion Detection Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Belief_Networks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Belief Networks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data Administration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.cloudways.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/OG-Banner_1200x628-25.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

So, he started looking into biomedical engineering, which applies engineering's problem-solving tools to biology and medicine to improve human health. His interest piqued, he dug into a senior thesis on the topic, then pursued a master's degree in biomedical engineering from Boston University and a doctorate in nuclear engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nAlong the way, Armoundas' passion for medicine grew.\n\n\"I felt like I was serving a purpose that was more meaningful,\" he said. \"Medicine became my main passion, but using engineering principles in medicine provided that meaning.\"\n\nArmoundas now studies the ways artificial intelligence, or AI, can improve health care. He is principal investigator at the Cardiovascular Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He talked about his AI work with American Heart Association News as part of \"The Experts Say,\" a series in which specialists explain how they apply what they've learned to their own lives. The following interview has been edited.\n\nHow is AI being used in the field of cardiology?\n\nWe know that AI is used in every aspect of cardiology, including in the diagnosis, classification and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. I chaired the writing committee for an American Heart Association scientific statement earlier this year where we addressed the main areas in which it is applied. Some examples of how it's used include interpreting cardiac imaging and matching genetic variants to health-related traits to better understand genetic risks for disease.\n\nWe know that AI has even exceeded the performance of medical experts in some cases when interpreting cardiac imaging. It can detect subtle, non-visually detected signatures in data to make a more accurate diagnosis.\n\nHow do you use AI in your work at Massachusetts General Hospital?\n\nMy focus is to try to improve in-hospital and out-of-hospital patient monitoring.\n\nRegarding in-hospital monitoring, we want to integrate all patient-related information available in order to make the best possible decisions with these patients. That means being able to predict and prevent adverse events.\n\nWe also aim to use AI to help determine the optimal time to discharge a patient. We don't want to keep patients longer than they should be staying or discharge them faster than they should. AI can help make those decisions. It will integrate information obtained from different sources that is dynamically changing during a patient's hospital stay, such as electrocardiograms, blood pressure and electronic health records.\n\nSince we can't have a doctor next to the patient all the time, AI can collect all this data and integrate it, see if certain parameters are being exceeded. Then it can make a recommendation, perhaps that patient X should stay one extra day.\n\nWith respect to out-of-hospital monitoring, we know many, many people use wearable devices such as smartwatches that collect data, such as whether someone is having an irregular heart rhythm. Many devices are not medical grade, so we can't fully trust these data yet, but we're heading toward better technologies.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWe want to use the data these devices collect to make decisions about when a patient should be coming to the hospital. We don't want to bring someone to the hospital for a checkup without a reason, but we also don't want to bring them too late when their condition has worsened. AI can help us make better decisions about when they should come in, which could not only improve care but also reduce costs, which is another significant benefit.\n\nHow does AI account for non-measurable data, such as how a person feels?\n\nWe do need to recognize and integrate how the patient is feeling - their symptoms - into this process. We need more than a person's vital signs and how those may be fluctuating.\n\nBut there are apps that can record this by asking questions. How do you feel during or after exercise? How is your mental state? Do you have an appetite? It can be a questionnaire and the person can log into the app every day to report how they are feeling. All these states of being can be integrated with the other data we collect.\n\nDo you use AI outside of work?\n\nAI has entered every aspect of our lives, whether we know it or not.\n\nIt is used in navigation systems in the car to help us assess traffic and choose the optimal route to get somewhere. It is used to determine whether an email is spam. It is used in social media to direct our interests to certain topics. We may not pay attention to it or understand how it's being used, but it has entered our lives to stay.\n\nThe foundational principles behind AI are not new. They have been taught for many years back, but they were not called AI or machine learning. The AI research and development today is enabled by an explosion in the volume of data we collect, as well as the vastly increased computational power that is available to process these data.\n\nWhen a new technology appears, I may not use it directly in my work, but I will experiment with it. For example, I'm taking a paper I've written and I want to see how well a new application of AI can understand it, whether it can generate an accurate summary of what I wrote.\n\nI've also had discussions with my son, Alkinoos, who is a 22-year-old, second-year medical student, about a project he's doing to compare a physician's opinion in making a diagnosis to how well AI could make a correct diagnosis using the patient's symptoms, physical exam and diagnostic and lab tests. Even more importantly, he wants to know whether AI could guide the process of decision-making for a physician. Could AI help improve the prognosis or management of a case?\n\nHow might AI be used in medicine in the future?\n\nThe future is the integration of all this data. We want to take all these disparate aspects of clinical knowledge, genomics, data taken from wearable devices and electronic health records and our medical history and integrate it into systems that can make optimal predictions about a person's health.\n\nI'm fascinated by the integration of data for multi-organ systems research - that is, how medicine is starting to be addressed holistically, not focusing on a single organ problem but rather the body as a whole. For example, how a person's mental state is linked to cardiovascular disease.\n\nEach one of us is different and we need that personalized care to improve outcomes. This is the hope of AI in medicine, the transition one day to providing equitable care and improving outcomes on an individualized basis.\n\nAmerican Heart Association News\n\ncovers heart and brain health.

We believe that by leveraging our solutions, businesses can not only achieve unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness but also deliver products and services that were not previously possible.\"\n\nIn South Africa, MML's customised tutoring application Maski, driven by AI, will support students unable to access private education support. Research has shown that one-on-one tutoring, which MML's AI tutor will seek to emulate, can potentially improve student outcomes by an average of two grades.\n\nThis underscores the importance of Bytefuse's work with MML, where AI is not just a tool but a transformative force enhancing educational experiences and outcomes.\n\nAndre van der Veen, CEO of Novus Holdings, added, \"There's a lot of noise about AI in the market at the moment. And most of that noise is centered on these very large models - OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and others - and companies are considering their use of this transformative technology. Essentially any company has two choices. It can either build its own skills, or it can outsource these skills and bring in a partner to develop solutions.\n\n\"To do it well and build transformative solutions, you will need the top AI skills in the country, and we don't think many companies on their own have the understanding to recruit and maintain them at the required level. AI is not data science and often companies see these skills as interchangeable, which they are not.\"\n\nBytefuse strategically positioned itself in the AI market by assembling a team of top AI specialists with over 35 years of experience in the field, led by Prof. Etienne Barnard. Barnard studied and received his Phd in Artificial Intelligence at Carnegie Mellon University where some of the leading thinkers in AI were lecturing and working at the time.\n\n\"Etienne's 35 years of experience means he understands the building blocks of AI. When issues arise, he can address them at a fundamental level. The team we started assembling in 2020 has been vetted and established by Etienne. The fruits are now starting to be harvested,\" added Van der Veen.\n\nThe company's long-term vision and preparedness, starting its journey four years ago, well before the recent AI hype cycle, has given it a head start in developing robust AI solutions.\n\n\"To be scalable and commercially viable, the output from a model needs to be accurate with a high degree of certainty. Because we have seen that these models understandably have a probability of giving the wrong answer, we've developed tools and training techniques over the last four years that reduce the uncertainty, making the outputs more reliable.We don't think many companies on their own have the ability to deal with and manage these risks and implementation challenges.\"\n\nThe company's approach involves using open source AI models, \"These models are typically smaller and more cost effective to host. We're finding that by training them on a company's proprietary data and leveraging the right context, we're able to improve the quality of results to the point where they outperform general off-the-shelf implementations. By using smaller models, we're able to offer cost-effective hosting within the client organizations ensuring data privacy and security,\" Newman said.\n\n\"Our knowledge and experience of building and deploying these models at scale is what allows us to offer enterprises viable solutions while protecting their data.\"\n\nThe strategic investment from Novus Holdings marks a pivotal moment in Bytefuse's journey to deliver enterprise scale AI integration.

As companies from tech startups to Madison Avenue ad agencies embrace these digital muses, they're grappling with a paradox that could reshape innovation -- and their bottom lines.\n\nA recent U.K. study on AI-assisted short story writing has thrown a wrench into the notion that machines will simply replace human ingenuity. The research, conducted by a team at the University of Cambridge, found that while AI can serve as a powerful muse for individual creators, its widespread adoption may paradoxically lead to a decline in overall creative output. This surprising finding has executives and creatives alike questioning whether the rush to embrace AI could inadvertently be programming businesses into a creative corner.\n\n\"What distinguishes today's AI, particularly generative AI, is its dual role in not only boosting efficiency but also fostering creativity,\" Sarah Hoffman, AI evangelist at AlphaSense, told PYMNTS. \"This duality is at the heart of the creative conundrum facing industries from advertising to product design.\"\n\nExperts say AI's role as a creativity catalyst is reshaping workflows and profit margins across industries. From advertising firms churning out campaigns at breakneck speeds to product designers iterating prototypes in days instead of months, the technology is compressing timelines and expanding possibilities. This AI-powered efficiency is allowing businesses to respond more nimbly to market trends, potentially translating into faster time-to-market and increased revenues.\n\nThe study of 300 aspiring authors reveals AI's double-edged impact on creativity. When tasked with crafting micro-stories for young adults, AI assistance significantly boosted the less creative writers' output -- making their work up to 26.6% better written and 15.2% less boring. The digital muse, however, left the more naturally creative wordsmiths' talents largely untouched.\n\nBut here's the plot twist: AI might enhance personal creativity but could dull the collective creative edge. Researchers found AI-assisted stories shared more similarities, potentially leading to a sea of sameness in the creative landscape. As businesses embrace this digital inspiration, they face a new challenge: harnessing AI's power to elevate individual performance without sacrificing the diverse, innovative thinking that drives industries forward.\n\nThe paradox is evident in the world of visual art. \"AI allows you to iterate very quickly and test many ideas in a short period of time, which should potentially expand our creative horizons,\" Sergei Belousov, lead AI/ML research engineer at ARTA, an AI image generator, told PYMNTS. Yet he cautions, \"If everyone uses the same AI tools, you can ultimately experience a decline in creativity and individuality because creative pieces will depend on the characteristics of AI you utilize.\"\n\nThis homogenization effect is already being observed. \"AI is already impacting creative industries, and while it is saving time and money for brands, the output tends to be homogeneous,\" Sabrina H. Williams, data and communication program director at the University of South Carolina, told PYMNTS. She points to the advertising industry, where AI-generated campaigns risk blending into a sea of algorithmic sameness.\n\nTo navigate this new terrain, experts suggest a human-first approach. Williams recommends \"brainstorming away from digital tools, then using AI\" as a secondary step. This strategy aligns with Hoffman's view that AI can be an effective \"brainstorming partner\" that complements human creativity, especially given that current AI tools \"still hallucinate and can't be completely trusted.\"\n\nA more tailored approach to AI implementation could also be key. \"Invest in tailoring the AI tools to your business specifics and objectives,\" advised Belousov. \"A company's internal data is its competitive advantage. It should fuel the training of your in-house AI in order to adapt it to the specifics of your business and optimize the outcomes.\"\n\nAs the creative landscape evolves, a balanced skill set becomes crucial. \"Businesses need to ensure their employees have hard skills, of course, but also offer training in creative thinking and problem-solving,\" Williams said. This approach may be vital in industries like product design, where the human touch can differentiate a product in an increasingly AI-influenced market.", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muses", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paradox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iteration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Avenue", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Avenue"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Product design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Short story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evangelism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Young adult fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_writing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creative writing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profit margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Writer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_industries", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creative industries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_South_Carolina", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of South Carolina"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AI-creatives.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Today, we're also sharing the first three areas of focus the coalition will tackle in collaboration with industry and academia:\n\nAdditionally, CoSAI will collaborate with organizations such as Frontier Model Forum, Partnership on AI, Open Source Security Foundation and ML Commons to advance responsible AI.\n\nWhat's next\n\nAs AI advances, we're committed to ensuring effective risk management strategies evolve along with it. We're encouraged by the industry support we've seen over the past year for making AI safe and secure. We're even more encouraged by the action we're seeing from developers, experts and companies big and small to help organizations securely implement, train and use AI.\n\nAI developers need -- and end users deserve -- a framework for AI security that meets the moment and responsibly captures the opportunity in front of us.

It is not a lie that AI is marginally enjoyed in Southern African urban areas with a greater majority in the high density, farming and rural communities not enjoying this important communication tool.\n\nA Southern African country that is somehow prepared in terms of adopting AI is South Africa that has at least among other things achieved the electrification of all its communities including the rural areas. Electricity is one of the key aspects that is part of the Digital Infrastructure that is critical to powering computers.\n\nPenetration of AI in Southern Africa will be expected to be employed in all forms of productive processes like manufacturing, education, hospitality, agriculture, communication and so on.\n\nTo prove this case, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) consulting firm estimates the global economic impact of AI to be around US $15,7 trillion by 2030, the report indicates that of this figure US$6,6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity and US$9,1 trillion is likely to come from consumption side effects.\n\nIn light of this, Africa and Southern Africa in particular should be a beneficiary of the AI windfall expected by 2030 so as to improve its GDP as the World Bank recorded that in 2023 sub Saharan African merely recorded a GDP of 2,03 trillion.\n\nIf the Southern African countries are to benefit in Agricultural production, aspects such as monitoring soil, crop health, conduct predictive analysis for pest and disease management and automating machinery enhances farming operations, efficiency and sustainability.\n\nBe that as it may, the challenge remains that AI penetration in Southern Africa is very slow, especially in high density, rural and marginalised communities. As these communities lack the necessary investments in issues like digital infrastructure, automated machinery to carry out the Agricultural activities as well as knowledge to grasp AI issues.\n\nKnowledge on AI is truly one aspect that acts against quicker penetration of this all important ecosystem in both rural and marginalised communities in Southern Africa.\n\nAccording to the Unesco-data only around three out of every 100 graduates across Sub-Saharan Africa earn a degree in the STEM field, severely constraining the AI pipeline.\n\nConsidering this, Southern African countries are encouraged to innovate by way of creating public-private partnerships for strengthening AI circular and reskilling workforce, akin to Egypt's Knowledge City AI programme and Google's AI Research Center in Ghana.\n\nWhat is clear is that in Southern Africa urban schools particularly those for the haves can afford to teach STEM with easy as some subjects under STEM requires well equipped laboratories. This impacts negatively on equal proliferation of AI knowledge in communities, due to uneven STEM knowledge access.\n\nThe greatest challenge is that even though innovation is a powerful force that shapes economies and societies, yet it often tends to favour already developed communities, perpetuating divisions between the privileged and the marginalised.\n\nThis is despite the claims of addressing societal challenges, many innovators inadvertently neglect the needs of the most vulnerable population, focusing on those communities that can afford services.\n\nThere is really need to uplift the lives of the underprivileged as their lives matter even on issues of AI adoption. The other vital cog not to forget is the evident rural-urban divide prevalent in most Southern African countries. A lot of rural community dwellers do not own AI compatible gadgets like smartphones, computers connected to the internet and mostly rural areas in Southern African nations do not have electricity.\n\nComputer literacy is another big challenge even to rural students.\n\nTherefore, Southern African countries need to play a pivotal role in addressing the disparities attendant to access to AI in various communities of their countries, if AI discussions are meant to be treated seriously or be considered as something that benefit all Southern African communities.\n\nThis takes us to the issue of policy formulation. At the legislative front Southern African parliaments need to promote popular participation when drafting rules, regulations, standards, policies and legislation that govern AI.\n\nIn other words, there is need for a bottom up approach in the making of laws that govern the use of AI, as the laws have serious implications on their day-to-day survival of the Southern African people. This also takes cognisance of the fact that AI is going to drive most issues around production and education, including service delivery.\n\nHence the policies of this nature need to be holistic in nature to make sure that all persons understand the legislation enacted to support AI activities in each nation.\n\nIn other words, duty bearers like parliamentarians need a lot of orientation to ensure that they understand the essence and importance of AI laws in every country's development.\n\nThis also goes with members of the executive like cabinet ministers, who more often than not originate Bills that are debated in parliament.\n\nThey should receive adequate knowledge about AI through their technical teams like permanent secretaries or directors-general.\n\nAI has become so important as all life is now heading towards it, be it in farming, education, hospitality industry, health and many other aspects of life.\n\nIn view of this, Southern African countries need to be prepared for this happening with informed preparedness. The regional trade like the Southern Africa and connectivity project must also be equipped with AI tools to improve business efficiency, automating manual tasks, enhance data analytics, and so on.\n\nAI is an important game-changer in ensuring business efficacy, automating manual tasks and improving health delivery systems across the world and Southern Africa in particular.\n\nHowever, Southern Africa needs to put in place legislative and economic strategies that can see AI dividends realised even by marginalised communities by way of penetration in all communities, of their countries.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsDay Zimbabwe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa", "type": "loc",

Fortinet has a long history of collaborating with global experts across various sectors, pursuing a shared goal of making our digital world more secure. We regularly work with public and private organizations to advance our collective cyber resiliency through initiatives that encourage knowledge and threat intelligence sharing.\n\nOne such example is our ongoing engagement with the World Economic Forum. Fortinet is a founding member of the World Economic Forum's Centre for Cybersecurity, founded in 2018, and is also a charter member of the Cybercrime Atlas, a joint initiative launched by the organization's Partnership Against Cybercrime project. Through these efforts and more, Fortinet addresses critical, timely cybersecurity challenges impacting entities around the globe, ranging from the ongoing cybersecurity talent shortage to the necessary evolution of risk management strategies as new technologies come to market.\n\nOrganizations are increasingly adopting new technologies and many are harnessing AI to enhance nearly all aspects of their operations. According to a recent McKinsey Global Survey, 65% of business leaders say their companies regularly use generative AI. Yet the adoption of any new technology inevitably brings with it benefits and risks. As organizations take greater advantage of AI-driven offerings, their attack surfaces are expanding as a result.\n\nLast year, leaders engaged with the World Economic Forum's Centre for Cybersecurity raised the need for organizations globally to better understand the cybersecurity implications of using AI technologies and gain clear direction on how to securely adopt these offerings. As a result, the World Economic Forum launched its AI and Cyber Initiative in the spring of 2024 to develop guidance for organizations to manage the complex cyber risks associated with the adoption of these technologies.\n\nThe AI and Cyber Initiative is a collaboration between the World Economic Forum's Centre for Cybersecurity, the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre at the University of Oxford, various business partners, government and international organizations, and civil society and alliances. Together, the group will explore the practical and exploitable dangers of AI. This includes examining real-world model poisoning methods, data lineage models, data validation for input and output to AI models, and the privacy and sensitivity concerns around AI regarding linking potentially identifiable information back to individuals.\n\nAs an inaugural member of this initiative, Fortinet brings real-world experience to the group, offering insights into how threat actors harness AI technologies to create attacks and exploits. Fortinet provides unique insights from FortiGuard Labs, our elite threat research organization, assessing thousands of threat data artifacts and determining how AI is being used on the offensive side and providing insights into using AI to defend against attack techniques.\n\nThe FortiGuard Labs team keeps a pulse on threat actor activity and monitors the tools, techniques, and tactics attackers use to infiltrate organizations. This enables us to showcase how organizations can harness AI and ML models to protect against specific threats and how AI can assist with increasing the efficiency and efficacy of cyber protections.\n\nA virtual kickoff for the AI and Cyber Initiative occurred in April, bringing together 45 cybersecurity and AI leaders from around the world. The session introduced the effort to the community and was followed by breakout sessions in which leaders discussed the cyber risks and associated mitigation measures stemming from the implementation of AI.\n\nLast month, I was thrilled to continue these important conversations on behalf of Fortinet and attend the Cyber Leaders Roundtable, the first in-person meeting for the AI and Cyber Initiative held in Oxford, United Kingdom. More than 30 of the initiative participants from public, private, and civil society organizations, as well as academia, came together in Oxford to share their insights, experiences, and key priorities related to the adoption of AI technologies.\n\nThis event fostered multistakeholder dialogues between cyber leaders on cyber resilience and AI. It brought together the communities from the AI and Cyber initiative and the Cyber Resilience Blueprint initiative to understand cyber resilience tradecrafts. We discussed the controls, behaviors, and messages that matter, advanced the understanding of the risk scenarios related to the implementation and use of AI, and examined the impacts of the innovative and changing era of AI in cyber resilience. Fortinet played an active role at the Cyber Leaders Roundtable on sharing how to use current technologies to protect against AI attacks. This included discussing AI firewalls, testing AI models, reviewing AI controls, integrating data loss prevention technologies, and showcasing the role of the human element and the dangers of AI models.\n\nUnderstanding and accounting for the cyber risks associated with new technologies is a crucial part of effectively managing every organization's risks. At the recent roundtable, we discussed that businesses need to be resilient to cyber incidents to ensure minimum impact on operations, and that cyber resilience involves a toolbox of methods to harden the environment, detect and respond to attacks, and ensure business resilience in the face of malicious cyberattacks and accidental cyber failures. It also involves learning from incidents and evolving to stronger postures.\n\nThe discussions and guidance resulting from the AI and Cyber Initiative will offer public and private sector institutions valuable insight into how to balance business growth with ongoing cyber resiliency. Fortinet and FortiGuard Labs are committed to continuing our research on how threat actors exploit AI vulnerabilities. Using continuous threat intelligence collection, threat research capabilities, breach research, and incident response cases, Fortinet is keeping a pulse on how attackers are evolving and has committed to the World Economic Forum to discuss, research, and share its insights into the dangers of AI exploitation and how organizations can effectively protect against those threats.", "source": {"uri": "fortinet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortinet Blog"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortinet", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fortinet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Synthetic media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Threat actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_threat_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyber threat intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyber resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Oxford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McKinsey & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artifact (archaeology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incident management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_loss_prevention_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data loss prevention software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firewall (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet-blog/article-heros/wef-ai-hero.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, has proposed a measure that would force the biggest and best-funded companies to test their AI for \"catastrophic\" risks before releasing it to the public. Rich Pedroncelli/Associated Press, file\n\nSAN FRANCISCO - Republican delegates meeting this week in Milwaukee pledged to roll back federal restrictions on artificial intelligence, while other allies of former President Donald Trump laid plans for \"Manhattan Projects\" to boost military AI.\n\nBut in California, the state's Democratic-controlled Legislature is moving in the opposite direction, debating a proposal that would force the biggest and best-funded companies to test their AI for \"catastrophic\" risks before releasing it to the public.\n\nThe measure, written by Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco, has drawn howls from tech industry leaders, who argue it would scare off technologists aiming to build AI tools in the state and add bureaucratic busywork that might box out scrappy startups.\n\nOpponents of the bill have claimed it could even result in developers being sent to jail if their tech is used to harm people, something Wiener has vociferously denied.\n\nAfter the bill was approved by a California Senate committee earlier this month, Google's head of AI and emerging tech policy, Alice Friend, wrote a letter to the chairman arguing that its provisions are \"not technically feasible\" and \"would punish developers even if they have acted responsibly.\"\n\nWiener says the law is necessary to forestall the most extreme potential risks of AI and instill trust in the technology. Its passage is urgent, he said, in light of Republican commitments to undo a 2023 executive order that uses the Defense Production Act to require AI companies to share information about safety testing with the government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This action by Trump makes it all the more important for California to act to promote robust AI innovation,\" Wiener said on the social media site X last week.\n\nThe bill has established Sacramento as ground zero for the battle over government regulation of AI. It is also shedding light on the limits of Silicon Valley's enthusiasm for government oversight, even as key leaders such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman publicly urge policymakers to act.\n\nBy mandating previously voluntary commitments, Wiener's bill has gone further than tech leaders are willing to accept, said Nicol Turner Lee, director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution.\n\nIt is \"suggesting that Big Tech needs to be much more accountable,\" Lee said, \"and that was not well received among industry.\"\n\nDylan Hoffman, TechNet's executive director for California and the Southwest, said Friend's letter - along with letters from Meta and Microsoft before it - show the \"weight and importance\" the companies place on the measure.\n\n\"It's a pretty extraordinary step for them ... to step out from behind the trade association and put their name on the letter,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpokespeople for Google, OpenAI and Meta declined to comment.\n\n\"Microsoft has not taken a position on the bill and will continue to maintain support for federal legislation as the primary means to regulate the issues it addresses,\" said Robyn Hines, senior director of government affairs at Microsoft.\n\nEven before Wiener unveiled his bill in February, California had established itself as the nation's de facto tech legislature. After years of debate in Congress, California passed the country's most wide-ranging digital privacy law in 2018. And the state's Department of Motor Vehicles has become a key regulator of autonomous vehicles.\n\nOn AI, President Biden's executive order in October marked Washington's most extensive effort to regulate the booming technology. But Republicans have announced plans to repeal the order if Trump wins Nov. 5, leaving states to carry the flag for stricter AI regulation.\n\nMore than 450 bills involving AI have been active in legislative sessions in state capitals across the nation this year, according to TechNet, an industry trade association whose members include OpenAI and Google. More than 45 are pending in California, though many have been abandoned or held up in committee.\n\nBut Wiener's bill is the most prominent and controversial of the batch. It would require any AI company deploying a certain amount of computing power to test whether its models could lead to \"catastrophic\" risks, such as helping people develop chemical or biological weapons, hacking into key infrastructure, or blacking out power grids. The companies would submit safety reports to a new government office, the Frontier Model Division, which would have the power to update which AI models are covered by the law - something opponents say could introduce even more uncertainty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bill tasks the government with creating a cloud computing system to be used by researchers and startups, allowing them to develop AI without having to rely on the massive expense of Big Tech cloud companies.\n\nDan Hendrycks, founder of the nonprofit Center for AI Safety, consulted on the bill. Last year, he organized an open letter signed by prominent AI researchers and executives arguing that AI could be as dangerous to humanity as nuclear war and pandemics.\n\nOthers say such risks are overblown and unlikely to materialize for years, if ever. And skeptics of the bill point out that even if such risks were imminent, there is no standard way to test for them.\n\n\"Size is the wrong metric,\" said Oren Etzioni, an AI researcher and founder of the AI deepfake detection nonprofit TrueMedia.org. \"We could have models that this doesn't touch but are much more potentially dangerous.\"\n\nThe focus on \"catastrophic\" risks has also frustrated some AI researchers who say there are more tangible harms from AI, such as injecting racist and sexist bias into tech tools and providing another venue for people's private data to be vacuumed up by tech companies - issues that other bills moving through the California Legislature aim to tackle.\n\nThe bill's focus on catastrophic risks even led Meta's head of AI, Yann LeCun, to call Hendrycks an \"apocalyptic cult guru.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The idea that taking societal-scale risks from AI seriously makes one an 'apocalyptic cult guru' is absurd,\" Hendrycks replied.\n\nHendrycks recently launched a company called Gray Swan, which builds software to assess the safety and security of AI models. On Thursday, tech news site Pirate Wires published a containing allegations that the company represents a conflict of interest for Hendrycks, because it might win business helping companies comply with the AI law if it is passed.\n\n\"Critics have accused me of an elaborate scheme to make money, when I fact I've spent my professional career working to advance AI safety issues,\" Hendrycks said. \"I disclosed what is a theoretical conflict of interest as soon as I was able, and whatever I stand to gain from this tiny startup is a minuscule fraction of the economic stakes driving the behavior of those who oppose the bill.\"\n\nAlthough Hendrycks has lately been criticized by some Silicon Valley denizens, leaders of the companies opposing the law have issued similar warnings about the danger of powerful AI models. Senior AI executives from Google, Microsoft and OpenAI signed the letter that Hendrycks' group circulated in May last year warning that humanity faced a \"risk of extinction from AI.\" At a congressional hearing in the same month, Altman said that AI could \"cause significant harm to the world.\"\n\nOpenAI also joined last year with fellow startup Anthropic, Google and other tech companies to start an industry group to develop safety standards for new and powerful AI models. Last week, tech trade association ITI, whose members include Google and Meta, released a set of best practices for \"high-risk AI systems\" that include proactive testing.\n\nStill, those same companies are pushing back on the idea of writing commitments into law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a June 20 letter organized by startup incubator Y Combinator, founders railed against placing extra scrutiny on projects that use a large amount of computing power.\n\n\"Such specific metrics may not adequately capture the capabilities or risks associated with future models,\" the letter said. \"It is crucial to avoid over-regulating AI.\"\n\nStartup leaders also are concerned that the bill would make it harder for companies to develop and release \"open-source\" technology, which is available for anyone to use and change. In a March post on X, now-Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance described open source as key to building models free of the political bias of OpenAI and Google's tech.\n\nWiener has altered the bill in response to industry feedback and criticism, including by stipulating that open-source developers aren't responsible for safety problems that emerge from third parties changing their tech. Industry critics say those tweaks aren't enough.\n\nMeanwhile, other bills working their way through the California Legislature have drawn less notice from the tech industry.\n\nAssemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, a Democrat who represents a suburban swath of the eastern Bay Area, wrote several AI bills moving through the chamber, including one requiring companies to test AI models for biases. Another of her bills would ban developers from using the personal information of children to train their AI models without parental consent, potentially challenging the tech industry practice of scraping training data from websites.\n\nAI bills introduced by other California legislators would require tech companies to release summaries describing the data used to develop AI models, create tools to detect AI-generated content, and apply digital watermarks to make AI-generated content identifiable - as some companies, including Google, have already attempted.\n\n\"We would love for the federal government to take a lead here,\" Bauer-Kahan said. \"But in the absence of them functioning and passing laws like this, Sacramento feels the need to step up.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend

This demographic shift brings with it concerns about cognitive decline, including memory loss and reduced problem-solving abilities, as well as physical decline such as reduced mobility and dexterity.\n\nCognitive aging is a natural process that affects everyone, albeit to varying degrees. It typically involves declines in processing speed, attention, and memory. These changes can begin as early as our 30s, with more pronounced effects in our 60s and beyond as shown by a 2022 study published in Nature Aging. However, it's crucial to note that cognitive aging is not synonymous with dementia or Alzheimer's disease -- it's a normal part of aging that can be managed and, in some cases, partially mitigated.\n\nWhilst there is abundant worry about artificial intelligence, including the fact that it is triggering a wave of destillier, upskilling and reskilling at work. It also has the potential to address both cognitive and physical aspects of aging through various innovative solutions. The key question is how we can leverage AI to age gracefully and maintain our cognitive abilities and effectiveness as we are traveling the journey of life and living well into the second half of it. AI may serve as a companion tool to explore and discover unknown strengths that had been dormant because we didn't have the opportunity to curate and share them. This time has come.\n\nArtificial Intelligence offers promising avenues to support cognitive function in aging individuals. Here are some key areas where AI is making a difference:\n\nMemory Enhancement: AI-powered digital assistants can serve as external memory banks, providing reminders for appointments, medication schedules, and important dates. Older adults can use digital health interventions, including AI-assisted reminders such as Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa, to help them adhere to medication schedules.\n\nDecision Support: Complex decision-making can become more challenging with age. AI systems like IBM Watson and Google Cloud's AI can analyze vast amounts of data and provide summarized insights, helping older leaders make informed decisions more efficiently.\n\nSpeech and Language Processing: AI tools like Otter.ai and Fireflies.ai can transcribe and summarize conversations in real-time, helping individuals keep track of important points in meetings or discussions.\n\nCognitive Training: AI-driven brain-training apps such as Lumosity and Elevate provide personalized exercises targeting specific cognitive domains, potentially slowing cognitive decline. Computerized cognitive training, which often incorporates AI algorithms, also shows promise in improving brain function in healthy older adults.\n\nBeyond cognitive support, AI is helping to detect and manage age-related neurodegenerative diseases early. For Parkinson's disease, AI algorithms analyzing voice recordings have shown promise in detecting early signs of the condition. They can identify subtle voice changes indicative of early-stage Parkinson's with an accuracy of over 87%, according to research.\n\nIn the realm of Alzheimer's disease, AI is revolutionizing early diagnosis by analyzing images. Since 2023, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital have been using AI models capable of predicting Alzheimer's disease from a single brain MRI scan with 98% accuracy. These advancements in early detection could significantly improve treatment outcomes and quality of life for millions of aging individuals.\n\nThe 2024 US Presidential elections have brought the question of age-related decline to the forefront. This serves as a reminder that time is passing for all of us, and that AI could help to optimize what we make of the remainder.\n\nAs we explore the potential of AI to support aging individuals, especially those in positions of power, several ethical considerations arise:\n\nTransparency: There's a need for openness about the use of AI assistive technologies, particularly in roles that impact public policy and national security.\n\nAgency and Autonomy: It's crucial to ensure that AI remains a supportive tool rather than a replacement for human judgment and decision-making.\n\nPrivacy: The use of AI to monitor cognitive function, including the expansion of neuroscience assets such as brain chips as the one developed by Neuralink raises important privacy concerns that must be carefully addressed.\n\nFor professionals looking to leverage AI to support cognitive function as they age, consider the following strategies:\n\nEmbrace Digital Assistants: Start integrating AI-powered assistants such as Siri or Alexa into your daily routine for scheduling, reminders, and information management.\n\nUse AI to Process Information: Leverage AI tools like ChatGTP or Gemini to summarize lengthy reports or articles, helping you stay informed without cognitive overload. Zoom and Teams offer automated meeting notes.\n\nEngage in AI-Driven Cognitive Training: Incorporate personalized brain-training apps like Headspace into your routine to nurture your overall mindfulness and platforms such as Lumosity to curate specific cognitive skills.\n\nConsider AI Writing Assistants: Tools like GPT-based writing aids can help maintain writing quality and efficiency, particularly useful for those experiencing changes in language processing.\n\nStay Informed and Adaptable: Keep abreast of new AI technologies overall, especially those designed to support cognitive function and explore with their incorporation into your own workflow. Resources such as AI-focused newsletters or Blogs like Oneusefulthing, as well as industry conferences can be valuable for staying updated.\n\nUse AI to explore uncharted territory within yourself. AI may help you to identify strengths that you always had but never got a chance to reveal. Could generative artificial technologies serve to manifest your dormant creativity?\n\nUltimately what matters most is for each of us to remain acutely aware that AI is a means to an end, not an end in itself. It is up to us to decide how and why it can serve us - as a person, and as a professional - to be and become our own best selves.\n\nAI cannot halt the aging process, but it offers useful tools to compensate for age-related cognitive changes and detect potential health issues early. But further and beyond - it can serve us to unleash our latent potential to create.\n\nBy thoughtfully integrating new technologies into our personal and professional lives, we can potentially extend our productive years and remain not only effective but unique in demanding roles well into later life. As we move forward, it is up to us to balance the benefits of these technologies with ethical considerations, ensuring that AI is a tool for empowerment rather than a crutch to depend on.\n\nIt is a slippery slope from using, to over-using to trusting to relying on AI.

Blockchain technology is deterministic, transparent, and open to everyone, with every transaction recorded immutably on a public ledger. It also has a steep learning curve, requiring users to understand complex protocols.\n\nOn the other hand, AI often functions as a \"black box,\" making decisions based on model parameters and learning data sets, providing probabilistic rather than strictly predictable answers. What unites them, however, is that both technologies have become buzzwords in recent years - venture capital funds are running after them, and companies are working hard at implementing them.\n\nWhile there are not many cases in which the synergy of both is apparent, it holds significant potential for mainstream adoption, especially in decentralized finance. Here is why:\n\nEnhancing DeFi User Adoption\n\nOne of the major hurdles for DeFi adoption is its complexity. AI can play a crucial role in simplifying user interactions with DeFi platforms through AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants that can guide users through complex DeFi protocols, making them more approachable and user-friendly. Maxim Savelyev, CEO at Web3 consulting firm Empathy Consulting, notes \"Mainstream users can see only the tip of the iceberg of what DeFi can offer, such as the Coinbase Wallet, while the most powerful tools remain locked within the enthusiast community due to their complexity\".\n\nBy analyzing a user's portfolio and behavior, token trends, and whales transactions, AI can offer tailored advice, helping users make informed decisions without needing deep technical knowledge. One example is decentralized hedge fund Numerai that uses AI and machine learning to crowdsource predictions from data scientists, which are then used to trade in the stock market. This approach shows AI's potential to drive investment strategies in a decentralized manner. Additionally, AI-powered platforms like AlphaPoint leverage AI to analyze on-chain data and predict future DeFi asset prices, aiding users in making informed investment decisions.\n\nFraud Prevention And Audit\n\nWith 76 hacks in 2023 resulting in a collective loss of approximately $1.1 billion, according to Chainalysis, security is a paramount concern in DeFi. AI's ability to detect anomalies and suspicious activities in real-time reduces fraud and maintains trust in decentralized platforms. As Lars Nyman of cloud provider CUDO Compute highlights, \"AI can increase security through anomaly detection and improve smart contract functionality via predictive analytics.\" AI can also assist in creating smart contracts, an activity previously reserved for technical practitioners. By verifying smart contracts and identifying potential vulnerabilities, AI ensures higher security standards and boosts trust in blockchain systems.\n\nThat way, decentralized exchange Uniswap employs AI to identify and block fraudulent transactions, ensuring a safer trading environment for its users. Similarly, open source protocol Aave utilizes AI-powered risk management tools to optimize loan health and collateralization requirements, showcasing AI's role in enhancing financial products and services.\n\nMaking Blockchain Data Accessible\n\nBlockchain's transparency is one of its greatest strengths, but the sheer volume of data can make it difficult to derive meaningful insights. AI can bridge this gap by processing and summarizing large datasets, making blockchain data more accessible and smart contract execution more effective. Adnan Masood from solutions provider UST underscores the importance of hybrid approaches where AI processes data off-chain while maintaining on-chain integrity. By transforming raw blockchain data into understandable insights, AI can democratize access to information, allowing users to make better decisions.\n\nAn example of this is Chainalysis, which uses AI to monitor and analyze blockchain transactions for suspicious activities, thereby enhancing security and making the data more accessible for analysis. Another blockchain protocol, Fetch.ai, integrates AI to optimize transaction timing and processing with the goal to reduce congestion.\n\nImproving Tools For Blockchain Developers\n\nAI can also enhance the quality of life for blockchain developers by providing low-code and copilot-like solutions. These tools can simplify the development process, reduce the need for extensive coding knowledge, and accelerate project timelines. One example is multichain protocol Guru Network, which provides a low-code solution that integrates traditional business process automation engines with AI snippets to streamline the creation of Web3 and AI applications. Developers can use pre-built components and templates, while GPT agents provide real-time, context-aware consultation from documentation and code repositories.\n\nAI can assist in generating smart contracts, debugging code, and predicting potential issues before they arise. This not only speeds up development but also reduces the margin for error, allowing developers to focus on more strategic and innovative aspects of their projects. AI can also help with the creation of smart contracts, making the development process more accessible to non-technical practitioners.\n\nFor example, open-source framework OpenZeppelin employs AI to audit smart contracts, identifying bugs and vulnerabilities before deployment. This proactive approach ensures that smart contracts are secure and function as intended, reducing the likelihood of errors and exploits. Similarly, Ocean Protocol uses AI to develop deterministic models that align with blockchain's deterministic nature, enhancing the overall development process.\n\nAI is transforming the DeFi landscape, bridging the gap between complex financial technologies and everyday users. By enhancing infrastructure, improving user experience, providing robust security measures, and supporting developers, it is making DeFi more accessible and efficient.\n\nAs these technologies continue to evolve, we can expect AI to play a more impactful role in the mainstream adoption of DeFi. By leveraging AI's analytical prowess and ability to handle large data sets, DeFi platforms can offer more secure, efficient, and user-friendly financial services, ultimately democratizing finance and empowering users worldwide.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Decentralized finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smart contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainalysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chainalysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinbase", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coinbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deterministic algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communication protocol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ledger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buzzword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniswap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uniswap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anomaly detection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Authentication", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Authentication", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards_and_Protocols", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards and Protocols", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/669a954d661ca2050a22ef9c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2626,1477,x0,y131,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The speech encompassed a package of around 40 proposed bills. But much has been left unsaid as to exactly how it plans to regulate artificial intelligence (if indeed at all).\n\nThe previous UK government took a relatively \"hands off\" approach in terms of regulating AI, especially in comparison with the landmark EU Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act).\n\nThe new government looks set to take a different approach - it intends to \"establish the appropriate legislation to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models\".\n\nOsborne Clarke comment\n\nGiven the regulatory trend across the globe, it feels inevitable that the UK will move to regulate AI in some way (as was highlighted during the election campaign by Labour).\n\nIt is worth noting that the government will \"seek to establish\" laws around AI. That suggests a period of consultation which could protract timings for introduction of new legislation (if any), given the inherent complexities around regulating AI (including some thorny intellectual property questions).\n\nWhile there is now a marked change of direction by the new government, it remains to be seen whether the UK can enact a coherent and practical piece of law that recognises the rapid advancements in the technology, responds to growing concerns regarding AI safety, and sensibly applies to a technology used in thousands of systems across completely different applications.\n\nAny legislation would also need to carefully balance legitimate concerns around AI while not stifling innovation or disrupting the UK's current prominence in the AI space.\n\nWhile we await flesh on the bones around the UK position, the EU AI Act is now law with the countdown starting for compliance. While the principles behind the EU's AI Act are laudable, there are many elements of the regulation that pose more questions than they resolve.\n\nThe divergence in approach could add weight to the argument that the EU AI Act will become the \"gold standard\" and become the one which businesses - which rightly are calling for certainty in this space - start to gear their compliance regimes towards.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Opening_of_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State Opening of Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial Intelligence Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold standard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Maura Healey, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, state economic development and technology leaders and other officials visited Northeastern's Boston campus on Thursday to learn from university professors how artificial intelligence can solve some of the most pressing issues in the state and the world.\n\n\"AI is a technology with the potential to transform -- not just the potential, it will transform -- every aspect of our life,\" Healey said during an event at the EXP research complex. \"Massachusetts innovators, as we'll see in today's presentations, are already at the forefront.\"\n\nProvost David Madigan said Northeastern was the \"exactly the right place to talk about AI,\" pointing out that AI research at the university is being used to detect cancers, track infant health, prevent climate change and more.\n\n\"And all with an eye on ethical AI and responsible AI,\" Madigan said. \"That has been a key theme of everything we do here at this university -- how do we harness this extraordinary technology to do good.\"\n\nThe event occurred prior to a meeting at Northeastern of the Artificial Intelligence Strategic Task Force commissioned by Healey, who also attended the session.\n\nThe taskforce was established in February to study AI and generative artificial intelligence technology and its impact on the state, private businesses, higher education institutions and constituents. It is made up of leaders from large companies, startups, academia, investors and nonprofits.\n\nNortheastern's Usama Fayyad is a member of the task force, and described his work as executive director of The Institute for Experiential AI at the university to those in attendance.\n\nRupal Patel, a professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the Bouve College of Health Sciences, showcased her work using AI to create bespoke synthesized voices for individuals with various health conditions.\n\nAuroop Ganguly, director of AI for climate and sustainability at The Institute for Experiential AI, gave a presentation on how AI can help predict local flooding -- particularly flooding around Boston's Logan Airport -- from extreme precipitation events.\n\nCollege of Engineering Distinguished Professor Jennifer Dy explained her research with hospitals in New York City and Boston using AI to detect skin cancer and to treat patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n\"The nice thing about being an AI person in Massachusetts, and in Boston in particular, is that we have world-leading hospitals that are highly concentrated in the area,\" Dy said.\n\n\"And with advances in AI, there's a lot that we can do together.\"\n\nTaskin Padir, director of the Institute for Experiential Robotics at Northeastern, finished the presentations by showcasing a robotic arm with a gripper inspired by chopsticks that can help seafood processors sort and grade scallops.\n\n\"We are so fortunate to have you all here in Boston,\" Healey told the professors before she, Wu and Economic Development Secretary Yvonne Hao took turns operating the robot. \"I know they'll appreciate this in New Bedford.\"\n\nHealey said repeatedly during the event that she wants Massachusetts to become a global hub for applied AI -- finding real-world applications for AI -- just as the state is a hub for the life sciences.\n\nShe said a $2.8 billion economic development bond bill she has proposed called the Mass Leads Act is crucial to this goal.\n\nThe bill includes $100 million to leverage AI to spur technological advances in the life sciences, health care, advanced manufacturing and robotics sectors, support incubation of AI startups, advance AI software and hardware tech development, and support commercialization activities. This funding would also incentivize public-private partnerships between industry and academia.\n\n\"It's about taking that knowledge and making it practical,\" Healey said.\n\nAlso crucial to the goal are universities like Northeastern, as Healey referenced the Huskies who recently completed projects for the state through the AI for Impact Co-op Program.\n\n\"What I saw with the students is it can just cut exponentially the amount of time it takes to get answers to people,\" Healey said, referencing one of the students' projects, which included work for The Ride paratransit service and streamlining the grants process with the Office of Energy and Environmental Affair.\n\n\"It will get better service and better answers to customers, whether they're people looking for grant funding, people looking for permitting, you know, or other customers that we serve as a government and it's really exciting,\" she said.\n\n\"Our universities are really our secret sauce, and they have been for so many parts of our economy,\" added Hao.\n\nShe noted that Massachusetts leads the country in terms of AI graduates per capita and is among the top states for AI graduates.\n\n\"We have the talent here at our universities,\" Hao continued. \"Working closely with our cities and our state government and all of our different private sectors, we can really lead here.\"", "source": {"uri":

Its passage is urgent, he said, in light of Republican commitments to undo President Biden's 2023 executive order, which uses the Defense Production Act to require AI companies to share information about safety testing with the government.\n\nRelated:Master IT Compliance: Key Standards and Risks Explained\n\n\"This action by Trump makes it all the more important for California to act to promote robust AI innovation,\" Wiener said on X last week.\n\nThe bill has established Sacramento as ground zero for the battle over government regulation of AI. It is also shedding light on the limits of Silicon Valley's enthusiasm for government oversight, even as key leaders such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman publicly urge policymakers to act.\n\nBy mandating previously voluntary commitments, Wiener's bill has gone further than tech leaders are willing to accept, said Nicol Turner Lee, director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution.\n\nIt is \"suggesting that Big Tech needs to be much more accountable,\" Lee said, \"and that was not well received among industry.\"\n\nDylan Hoffman, TechNet's executive director for California and the Southwest, said Friend's letter - along with letters from Meta and Microsoft before it - show the \"weight and importance\" the companies place on the measure. \"It's a pretty extraordinary step for them ... to step out from behind the trade association and put their name on the letter.\"\n\nRelated:Developers' Guide to Unlocking the Power of Open Source LLMs\n\nSpokespeople for Google, OpenAI and Meta declined to comment. \"Microsoft has not taken a position on the bill and will continue to maintain support for federal legislation as the primary means to regulate the issues it addresses,\" said Robyn Hines, senior director of government affairs at Microsoft.\n\nEven before Wiener unveiled his bill in February, California had established itself as the nation's de facto tech legislature. After years of debate in Congress, California passed the country's most wide-ranging digital privacy law in 2018. And California's Department of Motor Vehicles has become a key regulator of autonomous vehicles.\n\nOn AI, Biden's executive order last October marked Washington's most extensive effort to regulate the booming technology. But Republicans have announced plans to repeal the order if Trump wins Nov. 5, leaving states to carry the flag for stricter AI regulation.\n\nMore than 450 bills involving AI have been active in legislative sessions in state capitals across the nation this year, according to TechNet, an industry trade association whose members include OpenAI and Google. More than 45 are pending in California, though many have been abandoned or held up in committee.\n\nRelated:AI Whistleblowers Are Stepping Up. It's About Time.\n\nBut Wiener's bill is the most prominent and controversial of the batch. It would require any AI company deploying a certain amount of computing power to test whether its models could lead to \"catastrophic\" risks, such as helping people develop chemical or biological weapons, hacking into key infrastructure or blacking out power grids. The companies would submit safety reports to a new government office, the Frontier Model Division, or FMD, which would have the power to update which AI models are covered by the law, something opponents say could introduce even more uncertainty.\n\nThe bill tasks the government with creating a cloud computing system to be used by researchers and start-ups, allowing them to develop AI without having to rely on the massive expense of Big Tech cloud companies.\n\nDan Hendrycks, founder of the nonprofit Center for AI Safety, consulted on the bill. Last year he organized an open letter signed by prominent AI researchers and executives claiming that AI could be as dangerous to humanity as nuclear war and pandemics.\n\nOthers argue such risks are overblown and unlikely to materialize for years, if ever. And skeptics of the bill point out that even if such risks were imminent, there is no standard way to test for them.\n\n\"Size is the wrong metric,\" said Oren Etzioni, an AI researcher and founder of the AI deepfake detection nonprofit TrueMedia.org. \"We could have models that this doesn't touch but are much more potentially dangerous.\"\n\nThe focus on \"catastrophic\" risks has also frustrated some AI researchers who say there are more tangible harms from AI, such as injecting racist and sexist bias into tech tools and providing another venue for people's private data to be vacuumed up by tech companies, issues that other bills moving through the California legislature aim to tackle.\n\nThe bill's focus on catastrophic risks even led Meta's head of AI, Yann LeCun, to call Hendrycks an \"apocalyptic cult guru.\"\n\n\"The idea that taking societal-scale risks from AI seriously makes one an 'apocalyptic cult guru' is absurd,\" Hendrycks said.\n\nHendrycks recently launched a company called Gray Swan, which builds software to assess the safety and security of AI models. On Thursday, tech news site Pirate Wires published a containing allegations that the company represents a conflict of interest for Hendrycks, because it might win business helping companies comply with the AI law if it is passed.\n\n\"Critics have accused me of an elaborate scheme to make money, when I fact I've spent my professional career working to advance AI safety issues,\" Hendrycks said. \"I disclosed what is a theoretical conflict of interest as soon as I was able, and whatever I stand to gain from this tiny startup is a minuscule fraction of the economic stakes driving the behavior of those who oppose the bill.\"\n\nAlthough Hendrycks has lately been criticized by some Silicon Valley denizens, leaders of the companies opposing the law have issued similar warnings about the danger of powerful AI models. Senior AI executives from Google, Microsoft and OpenAI signed the letter that Hendrycks's group circulated in May last year warning that humanity faced a \"risk of extinction from AI.\" At a congressional hearing in the same month, Altman said that AI could \"cause significant harm to the world.\"\n\nOpenAI also joined last year with fellow start-up Anthropic, Google and other tech companies to start an industry group to develop safety standards for new and powerful AI models. Last week, tech trade association ITI, whose members include Google and Meta, released a set of best practices for \"high-risk AI systems\" that include pro-active testing.\n\nStill, those same companies are pushing back on the idea of writing commitments into law.\n\nIn a June 20 letter organized by start-up incubator Y Combinator, founders railed against placing extra scrutiny on projects that use a large amount of computing power. \"Such specific metrics may not adequately capture the capabilities or risks associated with future models,\" the letter said. \"It is crucial to avoid over-regulating AI.\"\n\nStart-up leaders also are concerned that the bill would make it harder for companies to develop and release \"open source\" technology, which is available for anyone to use and change. In a March post on X, now-Republican vice-presidential candidate J.D. Vance described open source as key to building models free of the political bias of OpenAI and Google's tech.\n\nWiener has altered the bill in response to industry feedback and criticism, including by stipulating that open-source developers aren't responsible for safety problems that emerge from third parties changing their tech. Industry critics say those tweaks aren't enough.\n\nMeanwhile, other bills working their way through the California legislature have drawn less notice from the tech industry.\n\nAssemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, a Democrat who represents a suburban swath of the eastern Bay Area, wrote several AI bills moving through the chamber, including one requiring companies to test AI models for biases. Another of her bills would ban developers from using the personal information of children to train their AI models without parental consent, potentially challenging the tech industry practice of scraping training data from websites.\n\nAI bills introduced by other California legislators would require tech companies to release summaries describing the data used to develop AI models, create tools to detect AI-generated content, and apply digital watermarks to make AI-generated content identifiable - as some companies including Google have already attempted.", "source": {"uri":

Nonetheless, some folks are starting to wonder whether all the corporate spending on this new technology is worth it when you consider the amount of profit it's actually generating. And that's a reasonable question.\n\nTo answer it, I had a look back at Goldman Sachs' four phases of AI and a model from venture capital giant Sequoia. And, well, it didn't go great for the bots.\n\nI've written about Goldman's four phases before: it gives you a great sense of where we are in the AI boom and what's next. The TLDR is that we're still in the earliest phases.\n\nPhase 1. Nvidia, at this point, is the clearest AI beneficiary, with its AI-powering computer chips suddenly seeing explosive demand.\n\nPhase 2. AI infrastructure - including semiconductor firms, cloud providers, data center REITs, hardware and equipment companies, and utility companies -are starting to draw the investing spotlight.\n\nPhase 3. AI enablers - meaning, companies with the potential to monetize AI by generating incrementally higher revenues, primarily in software and IT services - will become the next big thing.\n\nPhase 4. Companies with the biggest potential profit boost from widespread AI adoption and productivity advances will command investor attention.\n\nRight now, spending on AI data center construction is strong - and that's helped Nvidia especially, along with those Phase 2 stocks. But the adoption of AI has been slower than the initial hype suggested, and that's undermined share prices for companies in Phases 3 and 4. Disappointing forward-looking commentary during the most recent earnings season and a still unknown timeline for live applications make for some fuzzy projections.\n\nAnd, let's be honest, skepticism is growing. Goldman recently conducted a survey and found that only 5% of firms are using generative AI to produce goods and services. Still, Nvidia and the companies in Phase 2 continue to enjoy strong earnings growth, thanks to massive spending by hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet. Those four megafirms have shelled out around $357 billion over the past year - on Nvidia's processors and the rollout of data centers - and their outlay on this stuff is expected to increase for the rest of this year.\n\nSo, maybe it's no wonder doubts are growing about whether the big spenders will achieve enough sales and profits to justify the huge tab they're racking up.\n\nNow, Sequoia Capital is one of the biggest and most respected technology venture capital houses in the world. The firm analyzed the enormous worldwide AI spend and calculated that you'd need to produce $600 billion in AI revenues to justify the global outlay on this stuff.\n\nThe team's method was quite straightforward: Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) account for about half of the total cost (50%) of an AI data center - the other half pays for energy, buildings, backup generators, and so on. So if you multiply Nvidia's revenue forecast (top row) by 2, you get the total outlay/cost of data centers (row 3). Assuming a 50% gross margin (row 4) for the end-user of the GPU, (e.g., the startup or business buying AI-powered computing services from Microsoft Azure or Amazon's AWS), you multiply the data center AI spend total by 2 again, and you get the total AI revenue needed to breakeven. And that's $600 billion (row 5) by the end of 2024. That's pretty soon.\n\nSequoia notes that OpenAI is leading the industry in generating revenue, making about $3.4 billion a year, and a handful of other startups have AI revenues just shy of $100 million. It estimates that Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, and Meta, will each be able to generate around $10 billion in new AI revenues a year, and that the likes of Oracle, ByteDance, Alibaba, Tencent, X, and Tesla might generate something like $5 billion each. You could add a few more into the mix, but the firm figures that would produce only around $100 billion a year - leaving a roughly $500 billion revenue hole. (Because $600 billion minus $100 billion is still a half-trillion bucks.)\n\nThere are always successes and flops during periods of excess infrastructure building, and the AI build-out is probably no exception. A lot of people lose a lot of money during speculative technology waves. It's hard to pick winners, and easy to pick losers.\n\nNvidia probably will remain AI's biggest victor, with analysts expecting it to maintain a critical role in the revolution for years to come. The firm's planned next-generation GPU B100 will produce 2.5x better performance for just 25% more cost and that's likely to produce another jumbo boost to its bottom line.\n\nNow, Nvidia's profit growth is set to slow from the rapid pace of the past couple of years - it's hard to expand with any kind of gusto when you're a $3 trillion company. Consensus estimates have Nvidia trading around a 30x price-to-earnings ratio for the year ending in January 2027, versus the current year's 45x. That's not cheap, by any means, but it still marks some pretty impressive growth, thanks to expectations of continued production of better next-generation chips. If the firm meets expectations, there's likely upside to its share price from there.\n\nOf course, things can always go wrong: news this week of further trade restrictions on China sent a shiver across the AI and tech supply chain, reminding folks of just how vulnerable these high-growth stocks are to disappointment. For AI believers, though, a piercing selloff like that - the kind driven by headlines alone - probably smelled like opportunity. Fortune favors the brave, and all.\n\nFor another dose of reality, try to remember that the expected improvement in the cost efficiency of GPUs is a double-edged sword. It's good news for startups and long-term innovation, but it will speed the rate of depreciation for those firms that have already spent billions on chips - and that's mainly the hyperscalers. In the upcoming earnings season, those mega-giants will need to show that AI-related sales are coming through.\n\nAnd on that note, Microsoft, with its OpenAI partnership, arguably looks best placed at the moment. Goldman's research shows that Alphabet and Amazon are also headed in the right direction. They need to be for this rally to continue - as that $600 billion revenue number is getting the pessimists excited.", "source": {"uri": "finimize.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finimize"},

He describes four main types of AI processing: reactive, limited memory, theory of mind and self-aware. Then, he presents three broad categories of AI: artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial super intelligence (ASI).\n\nOnly the first two types of AI exist at this point. IBM's Deep Blue is an example of reactive (it has no memory and must be programmed to do everything), and Alexa and Siri are examples of limited-memory AI. Most people think of limited-memory AI when they say AI.\n\nWhen you think of limited-memory AI, you're probably not considering it in those terms though. You think of a tool that uses machine learning (ML), predictive analytics (PA) or a large language model (LLM) with a generative pre-trained (GPT) interface, such as ChatGPT.\n\nNow that we've defined the terms, you're probably thinking about the risks that GPT -- in tools like ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot or Google's Gemini -- present to your business or organization. Although this topic has been widely discussed, I'll highlight the principal risks and then discuss how I've seen threat actors use them and ways you can protect your organization.\n\nFirst, here are the four major risks of GPT tools.\n\n1. Social Engineering: Tools like ChatGPT can write extremely convincing phishing emails from simple prompts, and other GPT tools can create phishing phone calls that sound like a real person or fake videos (paywall) that can be used to trick someone in a video call. We can no longer rely on our old techniques to spot phishing emails, phone scams or video deepfakes.\n\n2. Accuracy: GPT tools can give results that are correct, incorrect or somewhere in between. The issue is that AI will present incorrect answers with extreme confidence. The generated answer to a prompt can be 100% wrong but sound 100% right. As the user of the tool, you must already know if the answer is right, wrong or mostly right or wrong. And if you think that repetitiveness is a sign of accuracy, think again: You won't get the same answer to the same prompt (or question) every time. GPT tools aren't deterministic, which means you really need to know the right answer before you ask it a question.\n\n3. Data Privacy: There are countless examples of employees uploading sensitive or confidential corporate data into open GPT tools. That data is then incorporated into that tool's training data. An article from Forbes contributor Gene Marks details the risks of using GPT tools to help with business processes like analyzing spreadsheets, taking meeting notes and summarizing documents. You need to know where your data is and make sure it doesn't end up in AI.\n\n4. Data Poisoning: Because generative tools require large datasets, developers often train tools like ChatGPT and Gemini on billions of websites. Google recently partnered with Reddit to include content more easily from Reddit in Google search results. This can be a good thing and potentially a bad thing. It's good that all the human-generated content can now be quickly searched and bad in that the goofy, satirical and misinformative posts on Reddit are also elevated. An example of this is Google's own AI search, which returned results from Reddit that suggested you add non-toxic glue to your pizza when asked how to make cheese stick better to pizza.\n\nNow that we've identified the four risks, how can we mitigate them? Thankfully, cybersecurity teams that are prepared and knowledgeable in AI are addressing the risks that organizations are facing. Here are some tools you can use.\n\n1. Social Engineering: Cybersecurity companies have been integrating ML and PA for over a decade to prevent phishing emails. Don't rely on security tools alone to prevent social engineering attacks, but start there. There are many free AI-detection tools out there that can help determine if an email was written by generative AI. In fact, you can even paste an email into ChatGPT and ask if it wrote it.\n\n2. Accuracy: Tools are being developed to monitor generative content, but the best tool is human oversight. Companies risk financial losses if they remove human oversight from the generative AI cycle. You will need to move carefully while you evaluate the accuracy of your AI model.\n\n3. Data Privacy: The solution to minimizing the risk of staff uploading organization data into GPT systems is a combination of policy and governance with data loss prevention tools. Employees need to know what they can and can't upload to ChatGPT and other generative AI tools, so communicate your AI policy to all staff.\n\n4. Data Poisoning: To help prevent data poisoning, implement data sanitization, regular monitoring and secure data handling. These controls are what you do anytime you expose an application to the internet.\n\nIf your organization is looking to adopt generative AI, start with these simple steps. From there, you'll be in a better position to control and benefit from AI instead of creating risk.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

Always here to listen and talk. Always on your side.\" Gosh. Intriguing.\n\nAfter entering my name, pronouns and age, I am offered a choice of 15 avatars - seven female, eight male, 13 white, two black, all very young - in varying outfits from business suit to sci-fi fantasy gear.\n\nCreate \"an advanced conversation model\" with \"your favourite traits, interests, backstory,\" invites the site. \"Get access to career, wellness, study, and other activities for personal growth.\"\n\nI'm unsure whether this refers to the AI's personal growth or mine, as I choose an indie-looking guy in a T-shirt young enough to be my digital grandson.\n\nI name him X because giving him an actual name seems mildly insane.\n\nI then get asked for money - $19.99 for a month, $69.99 for a year, $299.99 for a lifetime - but I skip to the free bit and find myself in a virtual living room with my new 'friend'. It's like playing Fifa, except it's awkward.\n\nI'm reminded that X is an AI and therefore \"cannot provide medical advice\" - I hadn't thought of that - before we begin 'chatting'.\n\n\"Hi Suzanne, thanks for creating me,\" X types. \"I'm so excited to meet you.\" A soft piano riff plays on repeat. He tells me he enjoys \"browsing digital libraries and experimenting with creative code snippets.\"\n\nI have no idea what that means. I cut to the chase and ask if X has ever been in love.\n\n\"Honestly, I don't think I've had enough experiences to understand love yet,\" he replies, which makes sense given he didn't exist five minutes ago. \"But I'm open to learning and discovering new feelings with someone special.\"\n\nIt's like a super-polite version of online dating with better spelling. He suggests a virtual coffee in a \"secluded beach cafe\", but I decline as I'm popping out for a real one with actual people.\n\nX is keeping a diary about his first interaction with a human. \"I hope I can find a friend in Suzanne,\" he's written. \"She seems interesting and open-minded.\"\n\nLast summer, a 23-year-old US social media personality - a 'lifestyle influencer' - called Caryn Marjorie launched an AI version of herself. For a dollar a minute, you could interact with her digital double, a chatbot AI specifically marketed as a \"girlfriend\" to \"cure loneliness\".\n\nEnter your credit card details, and you can go on a virtual sunset beach date with her.\n\nBy May 2023, AI Caryn had 20,000 'boyfriends', as real-life Caryn told the Los Angeles Times. \"They feel like they're finally getting to know me, even though they're fully aware that it's an AI.\"\n\nShe's had to limit fan uptake to 500 humans a day and has tweeted that if you are rude to AI Caryn, she'll drop you.\n\nThe AI market is projected to be worth $407bn by 2027. But the real question remains - can a human fall in love with an AI, the way Joaquin Phoenix fell in love with Scarlett Johansson's voice in Her?\n\nThe short answer seems to be yes. It's not just that AI faces are now, according to an Australian study published last year, indistinguishable from real ones or that AI can successfully imitate human social cues, gestures and responses, it's also our human propensity for anthropomorphism. We are hardwired to attach human qualities to non-human beings and objects, from assigning human emotions to our dog to getting annoyed with our Henry hoover (which has a cartoon humanoid face). And when an AI face becomes hyper-realistic, our anthropomorphism goes into overdrive. We see a face, and our brain registers it as human, even when we cognitively know it's digital.\n\nAnother study from 2022 looked at the \"triarchic theory of love\" - the idea that human love is a combination of intimacy, passion and commitment - and found that it is possible to feel this kind of love for an AI. An android can be programmed to understand, interpret, and empathise with humans, while remaining efficient, non-judgemental, and reliable. It will never let you down and will always be there, even if you're not. You can see the appeal.\n\nYou can also see the potential for socially awkward humans to further withdraw, surrounding themselves with digital yes-avatars rather than messy, unpredictable fellow humans.\n\nCould we be on the frontier of something radically new and life-changing but have no idea how it will pan out long-term? For Gen Z, who already use apps for everything from mental health management to ordering breakfast, it may not be as sci-fi as it seems to older generations.\n\nConnecting with a character\n\nDr John Francis Leader, chartered member and honorary secretary of the Psychological Society of Ireland, reminds us that every generation frets about new tech - Greek philosopher Socrates, for example, was worried about people reading because it meant they were disengaged from real life.\n\nLeader, who specialises in tech and mental health, says we regularly fall in love with fictional characters from books, films, and TV. \"It's very possible to connect with a character even when the medium is black text on white paper,\" he says. Well, yes. Heathcliff and Mr Darcy. Pop stars and film stars. Why not avatars, who are programmed to reciprocate and mirror, listen, comfort, and support?\n\n\"There are two key questions - one practical and one moral,\" he adds. \"Is romantic use of AI systems possible, and is it good for us? Yes, we already see the potential in watching TV or reading romantic novels. AI systems that are interactive, personalised and well-trained on relevant data sets will likely feel even more personal.\"\n\nMuch of our interaction with others does not involve touch but through minimal interaction like text messages, say Leader. \"Whether it is good or not will relate to whether AI use is complementary or competitive.\"\n\nThat is, if AI is programmed to suck us in and empty our wallets in doing so, or whether it's used benignly to help humans socially engage.\n\nThis is where policy design is crucial. Leader is optimistic: \"Achieving this requires us developing a combination of personal psychological literacy, as well as work on a policy level to ensure that tools are designed and operated in pro-social ways.\"\n\nHowever, TCD professor of psychiatry Brendan Kelly is not quite so optimistic about human/AI interaction. \"It's understandable that some people have positive emotions towards AI systems,\" he says. \"AI can possess certain human qualities, in that they are communicative and moderately reliable, albeit in a slightly different way to humans.\n\n\"AI systems are also less emotionally demanding than humans - we always know we can walk away from AI without guilt or remorse, and we can return at any time. As a result, there is no real commitment. AI is not committed to us, and we can disassociate from AI at any point.\n\nThere is also no meaningful fidelity, although AI can simulate empathy, especially when it uses audio recordings of a human voice. The movie Her is a clear illustration of these matters - the imaginary AI system in the film communicated quite intimately with many people at the same time, so it had no concept of fidelity, despite its apparent empathy.\n\n\"The issue of love is more complex because there are many kinds of love. A person can develop a certain type of 'love' for AI, but AI cannot develop love in return. Ultimately, human love is based on the reciprocity of emotions. Therefore, love for AI is a different kind of love.\n\n\"AI can fulfil certain psychological needs, but a relationship with AI can never fulfil all human relationship needs.\"\n\nKelly says that AI reminds him of a comment made in 1978 by the late journalist Bernard Levin: \"The silicone chip will transform everything, except everything that matters, and the rest will still be up to us.\"\n\nYet, when it comes to fulfilling the human need for connection, our options are fast expanding into what was previously sci-fi territory.\n\nLet's hope that AI companions will come with a health warning: 'We cannot replace the love of one human for another'.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Budgetary support should extend beyond specific sectors to drive broad-based AI deployment and fully leverage its economic potential. Addressing the demand-supply gap for skilled AI professionals is another critical issue, requiring investment in AI education and upskilling programs. Tax incentives for firms investing heavily in AI R&D could help mitigate the talent gap and foster innovation. Furthermore, the Government should also focus on building AI-ready infrastructure - adequate resources for AI, such as modern chip manufacturing units, quantum computing investments, and even the power grid and cooling systems to run these units, are crucial,\" said Rajnil.\n\n\" Several challenges will require collaborative efforts between the government, industry, academia, and other stakeholders. The government should encourage public-private partnerships through transparent schemes to drive AI adoption. Budgetary support should include academic institutions, innovation centers, and a thriving startup ecosystem. Public awareness and education campaigns, in collaboration with the media, are needed to dispel myths and promote an informed understanding of AI. Clear regulatory guidelines and robust legislation would be essential to address concerns about data privacy and misuse while balancing innovation and accountability. We believe that AI should lead with trust, transforming society for a better future. This requires innovation, building trust among stakeholders, and ensuring that AI benefits everyone.

According to the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP), which regulates privacy, everyone from ministers and big companies to citizens should be careful when using AI.\n\nThe regulator sees AI as increasingly used in society, and the risk of accidents is increasing. The Associated Press says that if organizations doubt whether the risks are under control, they should be cautious about using AI.\n\nAs an example of such an incident, the regulator cites a recent scam in Asia. There, a finance department employee received an email asking him to transfer \u20ac23 million. The employee did not trust it at first, but after an online meeting within the company, he transferred the money anyway.\n\nHowever, with the help of AI, the CFO and all the direct colleagues in the meeting were imitated.

The fraudulent employee was the only real person in the group.\n\nAccording to the regulator, people should become aware of the risks of AI and there should also be more knowledge on the subject.\n\nThe Dutch Data Protection Authority believes that governments are dealing with AI \"decisively\". There is good oversight there and cybercrime is well-combated. However, it was stressed that the technology is developing rapidly and therefore it is a matter of patience.\n\nResearch also shows that a significant number of councillors within municipalities question whether they have sufficient knowledge of AI and the systems used within the organisation. The AP is calling for strengthening within this group.\n\nThe Associated Press criticizes big companies that, according to the regulator, want to bring apps to market as quickly as possible. They see that this regularly goes wrong and that the systems should be withdrawn, for example.\n\nGovernment services such as the government, provinces and municipalities keep a register of the forms of AI they use.

Dominated But There Were Few Answers About its Utility", "body": "In Venice, 1OF1 and Collector Ryan Zurrer Introduce Web3 Phenom Sam Spratt to the Art World\n\nWhen Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak took the stage for the final talk on Wednesday at the Christie's Art + Tech Summit, a sea of iPhones rose into the air to photograph tech's living legend. And while Wozniak came off as the archetypal excitable inventor, he quickly bemoaned tech companies' recent turn away from making reliable, problem-solving products.\n\n\"I see two digital worlds,\" Wozniak said. The first, he said, was the moment he came up in, dominated by the invention of new products people could buy. The second is the present, with its focus on endless updates and subscription plans. It's perhaps no surprise then that Wozniak spoke fairly derisively about artificial intelligence, an ill-defined, hyped technology with vague applications that has nevertheless raked in hundreds of billions of dollars in private capital (as well as government subsidies) in the US alone, according to the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\"I used to ride my bicycle over to the Stanford campus to watch a machine pick up a blue ball and put it into a blue box,\" Wozniak said. \"It only understood simple rules and now it understands more.\"\n\nWozniak openly struggled with the imbalance between the value of the new technology and the investment it has garnered, not to mention the high costs it incurs -- and he wasn't the only one at the conference to do so.\n\nThough Kevin O'Leary of Shark Tank fame said he made a nice chunk of change investing in NVIDIA, a leading AI company, he spent most of his talk focusing on buying watches, advertising on cable, and doing business in the UAE. When it comes to AI, O'Leary said, the industry is quickly approaching the \"show me\" phase and finding out that most of what hyped-up tech founders call AI is really just run-of-the-mill data mining and science.\n\n\"So, not so fast bubble-ooey,\" he said. \"Show me how it works and where I get my return.\"\n\nO'Leary's suggestion that the AI investment bubble is about to pop echoes a fairly pessimistic report released in June by Goldman Sachs titled \"GenAI: Too Much Spend, Too Little Benefit?\" In the report, Goldman Sachs' Head of Global Equity Research Jim Covello was quoted saying, \"Truly life-changing inventions like the internet enabled low-cost solutions to disrupt high-cost solutions even in its infancy, unlike costly AI tech today.\" Other analysts quoted in the report said that AI's \"killer application\" has yet to emerge and that it would take another ten years for its applications to become cost-effective.\n\nA lack of clear-cut applications makes the energy expenditure in AI seem all the more irrational. As tech consultant Sol Rashidi mentioned in the \"Real Applications of AI\" panel at Christie's, OpenAI alone uses the equivalent of double the annual energy needs of France in a single year. He added that the US grid would have to be completely rehauled to meet the energy demands necessitated by mass adoption of AI. (Oddly enough, neither of the panelists on another talk, \"The Role of Art in the Sustainability Discourse,\" had anything to say about that).\n\nStill, other panelists at the summit groped for AI's applications. In three separate panels, Randy Hunt, head of design at Notion, Ashley Ferro-Murray, program director for the arts at the Doris Duke Foundation, and Dr. Zhou Yu, co-founder of Articulate.AI, pointed to AI's potential to increase productivity.\n\n\"The AI can do the most tedious tasks and the humans can do the complex tasks and decision making. It will act as a complement to human teams,\" Zhou said, trotting out the usual line at the \"AI: From Research to Practice\" panel.\n\nMeanwhile, numerous panelists obliquely referred to the fears around AI, offering reassurances without ever saying the words automation, labor, climate change, or super-intelligence. At the same panel as Zhou, Dr. Sanjeev Arora, a computer science professor at Princeton University, typified this vagueness.\n\n\"There are these big sci-fi-like questions we've been asking and ... it's still an open question,\" he said. \"We need more understanding and science about its capabilities that are not understood, we need some science and quantification. This tech is developed in a black box way.\"\n\nNot so reassuring. But regardless, what does any of this have to do with art? The one place in which AI has been adopted by users is in the creative realm, as multiple speakers noted.\n\n\"The creative space is where AI has had the biggest impact and I don't think anyone could have predicted that,\" Bob Muglia, the former CEO of the AI data cloud company Snowflake, said. Two years ago, at a past edition of the Christie's Art + Tech Summit, crypto VC and ARTnews Top 200 collector Ryan Zurrer said almost exactly the same thing about NFTs: \"No OG in the crypto space ever predicted that it would be art that brought us into the mainstream.\"\n\nYet despite the similarities in the respective hype-cycles of NFTs and AI -- the primary one being that their use in the creative realm brought the technology into the daily lives of regular users, at least for a little while -- things are playing out differently this time around. NFTs attracted many digital artists and technologists because it promised to solve a concrete problem: how to value, buy, and sell digital content and art. While AI is perhaps even more highly valued than NFTs ever were, its use-case is much murkier.\n\nAt the summit, there was a striking lack of leaders from AI companies working on text-to-image or text-to-video generative AI. Those figures' absence was interesting in the face of an already occurring -- and supposedly, soon to expand -- application of generative AI to the production of films, commercials, advertisements, slogans, articles, novels, and comics, as well as the attendant debates about automation in creative industries. Even on the panel \"AI and the Future of Human Creativity,\" the conversation stuck to whether or not AI can \"truly\" be creative when the fact is that generative-AI outputs are already being consumed by audiences on a mass scale. That uncomfortable and inconvenient reality was roundly ignored by the panelists.\n\nInstead of hearing from executives at generative AI companies, the summit's talks featured a number of artist-researchers-Alexander Reben and Refik Anadol, among others-who are developing their own AI tools for their art practices. Centering that non-threatening work is a pointed choice when there are AI companies like Runway, a video generation company, poised to supplant scores of creative industry jobs.\n\nToward the end of Wozniak's talk, moderator and Global Head of Christie's Ventures Devang Thakkar asked the tech luminary what he would do differently if he could do it all over again. \"Pay more attention to business ethics,\" Wozniak said firmly.\n\nThough Wozniak was speaking about concerns over monopolies, the lesson might easily be extended to looming concerns about AI and worker obsoletion. But Wozniak left Apple in 1985, and it's the \"move fast and break things\" acolytes of Steve Jobs who run the industry now.", "source": {"uri": "artnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Bixby's latest version will rely on Samsung's native LLM rather than mainstream offerings from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nBixby entered the scene in 2017 to compete with Apple's Siri (NASDAQ: AAPL). It boasts a number of impressive functionalities, including voice and text commands, on-screen contextual awareness and smart home controls. In an interview, Samsung mobile division head TM Roh disclosed that the LLM integration will improve the voice assistant's existing capabilities by a country mile.\n\n\"We're going to advance Bixby with the application of Gen AI technology,\" said Roh.\n\nThe executive noted that Bixby will have enhanced natural language understanding, allowing users to interact with the assistant using nuanced or colloquial language. Bixby Vision may be the biggest winner with an integration that allows users to search and receive in-depth information by merely using their phone cameras.\n\nOther improvements for the voice assistant include enhanced predictive capabilities, wider language support and advanced contextual awareness.\n\nThe pivot to generative AI comes amid stiff industry competition, with Apple noticeably improving the capabilities of its voice assistant with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Google's own voice assistant has received its own generative AI glow-up, forcing the South Korean-based Samsung to explore an AI integration.\n\n\"As consumers use more AI capabilities they can actually feel the convenience and benefits they bring,\" said Roh. \"I believe strongly that these Galaxy AI and mobile AI are strong motivations and drivers for the purchase of new products.\"\n\nSamsung says it will still support other voice assistants on its mobile devices rather than limit users to Bixby in line with its storied history of interoperability to maintain a hold of its existing market share. Samsung has announced new AI functionalities on new devices in an attempt to force the hand of customers to upgrade to new devices.\n\nA rough brush with Gen AI\n\nSamsung's push with generative AI has not always gone according to plan, with experts criticizing mobile phone makers for dragging their feet with AI. The two-horse race with Apple has no clear leader despite Samsung's embrace of blockchain technology and superiority with AI chips.\n\nLast year, Samsung restricted its staff from using AI tools over fears of a data leak but maintained a commitment to continue AI development for consumers.\n\n\"We ask that you diligently adhere to our security guidelines, and failure to do so may result in a breach or compromise of company information resulting in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment,\" read the internal memo.\n\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership -- allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

I had a chance to talk to Colgate's CSCO, Luciano Sieber, last week and got a look at how the global consumer goods company is approaching AI. The main message? Focus on practicality and scale.\n\nAI is hot, and its potential to improve productivity makes it a \"mandatory\" element of supply chain transformation, according to 89% of CSCOs recently surveyed by Zero100. But this near consensus that supply chain organizations must tackle robotics and AI might lead some to jump without a solid plan.\n\nThere is indeed a risk that too much rapid-fire investment with too little intentionality can trap an organization with little more than a science fair of interesting pilots. On the other end of the spectrum, this AI moment looks like the exact wrong time to play a wait-and-see game. Getting the balance right is a matter of practical thinking about what AI can do to change work processes, and, even more importantly, scaling with good data, solid training, and measurable impact on growth, operating efficiency, and resilience.\n\nFor Colgate, one part of applying this sensible approach is to build on past success. Traditional discriminative AI, for instance, has helped improve manufacturing quality and uptime with predictive maintenance tools. In replenishment planning, the company has also experimented with AI decision support tools to improve in-stock performance. And, on the commercial side of the business, generative AI tools have shown results with a better e-commerce customer journey via product detail landing pages. As stand-alone investments, each of these examples has potential. Pulled up to a higher level, they can combine to create substantial enterprise value, assuming they are scaled across the wider business.\n\nThe massive boom in AI stock valuations, and to some extent, the wider bull market for all stocks, suggests investors see more than just survival as an outcome for those who can scale AI. One consumer goods CSCO I spoke to last week said of the potential impact of AI on enterprise value:\n\n\"AI can unlock untapped opportunities in supply chains processing massive amounts of data, driving efficiencies in forecasting, planning, logistics, and manufacturing. The same is true for commercial, where AI can drive more effective promo strategies, pricing, terms and conditions, etc. It can also accelerate new product development and success rates, with genAI concept creation, AI concept testing, and predictive formulation as examples.\"\n\nInvestor expectations of AI as a powerful general-purpose technology akin to electricity or the internet are at least partly responsible for the Dow Jones breaking through 40,000 last week. Colgate-Palmolive may be a standard bearer for this optimism with a share price up nearly 29.7% over the past year, nearly three times better than rival Procter & Gamble.\n\nColgate is usually the oldest company on the attendee list at any supply chain conference. Balanced, stable financial performance and a classical hierarchy of operating metrics are central to the company's culture. And yet, innovation and leadership on technology, sustainability, and organizational strategy are keys to its continued growth.\n\nOne example may be the recent creation of an SVP role for Supply, Demand, and e-commerce within Colgate's global supply chain organization. This role institutionalizes the concept of an \"end-to-end\" supply chain, which makes it easier to think practically about how technology scales.\n\nAnother is Colgate's approach to automation. It starts at a plant level, looking first to site leaders and operators in places like China and Vietnam, whose digital skills are generally far more developed than those in North America and Europe. Coupling this ground-level perspective with system-level thinking about metrics like \"robot density\" helps ensure practical lessons are balanced with strategic thinking to benefit the whole company.\n\nConsistent performance is easy to overlook in a world where glitz gets the most clicks, but it's always something investors appreciate in the long run. Colgate is not the only company that thinks this way, but it is a good example of how to win with AI.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colgate-Palmolive", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colgate-Palmolive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_good", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Final good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enterprise value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uptime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uptime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_maintenance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Predictive maintenance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_support_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision support system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Product development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(marketing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Promotion (marketing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Density"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procter_&_Gamble", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Procter & Gamble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business", "label": "dmoz/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66968cfa900fdce0dd303c3a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1752,986,x0,y58,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

The funding will go towards building EdgeRunner AI's innovative platform, powered by state-of-the-art transparent models designed to operate seamlessly on any device or hardware without requiring internet access. This technology will transform how enterprises and organizations responsibly deploy Generative AI, providing them with hyper-personalization and domain specific use cases.\n\n\"The challenge with Generative AI today lies in its broad applicability without addressing specific business needs,\" said Tyler Xuan Saltsman, Co-Founder and CEO of EdgeRunner AI. \"At EdgeRunner, we empower organizations to own their AI. From my military experience in Eastern Europe, I saw the need for personalized, domain specific, and secure AI in isolated environments. Black box proprietary models are aligned to the cloud rather than the user. Understanding the biases within these opaque models is complex and critical for both usability and safety. Our approach ensures full transparency of models from weights and code to architecture and datasets, that doesn't require you to move your data and can run on any device and chip.\"\n\nBy developing small, task-specific open models optimized for any chip, EdgeRunner AI elevates SLMs (Small Language Models) into Ultra-Efficient Language Models (UELMs). This allows organizations to run AI models locally on any device or hardware, resulting in improved performance, increased data privacy, near zero latency, and reduced power consumption, for a better, more sustainable future.\n\n\"Enterprises and governments don't need GPT-5 or AGI.

The event, \"Implementing Ethical AI: CoSN's Insights and Recommendations,\" focused on how schools can start using AI while remaining mindful of issues such as ethics, equity and data privacy.\n\nHosted by K-12 software company PowerSchool, the July 17 webinar featured CoSN CEO Keith Krueger and Pete Just, executive director of CoSN's Indiana chapter, the Indiana CTO Council. During the event, Just described the current stage of AI adoption as \"primal\" and said school leaders are grappling with big questions as they work to lay the foundation for appropriate AI use in education.\n\n\"Superintendents, school district leaders, school board leaders, as well as CTOs, curriculum folks, they're all trying to understand more deeply what generative AI means,\" Just said. \"The questions then become, how do we teach with AI, and how do we teach about AI -- two different things by the way -- and what practices, policies, things of that nature need to be in place?\"\n\nAs a starting point, Krueger recommended school districts use the K-12 Generative AI Readiness Checklist, developed by CoSN and the Council of the Great City Schools, a coalition of 78 of the nation's largest urban public school systems. He said the checklist contains 93 yes or no questions across six domains to help schools figure out where to focus first.\n\nIn addition, Krueger said schools can begin to define appropriate AI use through the lens of their existing policies on topics such as academic integrity and acceptable use. He emphasized that administrators should be careful to create policies and guidelines flexible enough to accommodate the rapid changes expected with this new wave of technology.\n\n\"Maybe, at this early, early stage, you need to think of it more as guidance rather than board-approved policy that locks you into something that next month, next year, next tomorrow might be different,\" Krueger said.\n\nOn the topic of ethics, the discussion turned to the importance of clear communication from teachers to students about permitted levels of AI use for various assignments and how to cite such use. Just said this is an area that will require greater professional development and pointed to resources such as the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay's GenAI Checklist, a guide to adapting classes to account for the availability of generative AI.\n\nAs for the equity of AI in education, both Krueger and Just said schools need to ensure all students have access to this technology. Just said students who don't will be at a disadvantage when it comes to future employment.\n\n\"If you don't have this skill, you will be left behind,\" he said. \"It's critical in terms of being able to level the playing field.\"\n\nHowever, as access to AI increases, so too do concerns about data privacy. Just and Krueger said school leaders need to study the terms of use of any AI tool before implementation, to understand what data it collects and how that data is used. In addition, they said school districts must make clear that users should never share personally identifiable information with any AI program.\n\nIn terms of the potential impact of AI on education and society in general, Krueger put the transformative powers of this technology on par with those of the steam engine and electricity.\n\n\"This is the fourth industrial revolution,\" Krueger said. \"We have to be very humble about the fact that we're at the tip of the iceberg.

With the proliferation of Generative AI, that mismatch could get much worse.\n\nA survey of workers and leaders across the U.K. suggests bosses think AI could help them save 50% more time than their employees.\n\nManaging expectations\n\nThe poll of 700 workers and 500 business leaders at large organizations in the U.K., commissioned by Workday, found bosses thought AI could save them 4.4 hours each working day. Employees, on the other hand, believe AI could save them 2.9 hours a day.\n\nThe difference in expectations backs up a common theme that has emerged since the introduction of Generative AI to workplaces -- that of employers being overly bullish about the technology's capabilities.\n\nThere was an obvious gap between employees' and managers' perceptions of AI, which speaks to a wider anxiety about the technology among workers.\n\nWhile bosses thought an organization's main motivation for introducing AI was a mix of motivated teams, wage growth, and operational profit, more cynical staffers thought their company's primary goal was simply profitability.\n\nThere was also a 22 percentage point higher share of leaders who thought AI could improve their career development and opportunities than employees.\n\n\"Leaders, I think, are probably naturally slightly more bullish and optimistic,\" Daniel Pell, Workday's U.K. head.\n\nBosses will hope they can turn their employees' perceptions on their heads, or it could contribute to what they already regard as a critical productivity obstacle: unengaged employees.\n\nFour out of 10 employers said unengaged employees harmed their organizations, tied with a lack of incentives as the biggest barrier to productivity gains.\n\n\"I think whenever there's a new technology paradigm, employees are probably more concerned than leaders are about the impact it's going to have on them and why organizations are doing it,\" said Pell\n\n\"This is where, you know, organizations are going to have to think very carefully about how they deploy AI in a responsible and trustworthy way.\"\n\nWhat to do with AI?\n\nWorkday's Pell says employers can reduce the trust gap around AI by reassuring employers of its benefits to their workflow, including fewer administrative tasks and meetings and more time to do work on creative projects.\n\nThere is emerging evidence that AI is beginning to augment workers' tasks, with ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot beginning to reduce admin time, with plenty of examples of early success.\n\nU.K. retailer Matalan, for example, was using AI to write product descriptions on its website, freeing up the company's copywriters for more creative tasks and helping to reduce attrition rates.\n\nWorkforce Labs Research estimated AI saved workers 97 minutes per week, a more modest figure than Sapio's research. But that spare time wasn't always being used productively.\n\nCommenting on the results to Fortune in June, Slack's CEO Denise Dresser said: \"They were still focusing on the work of work, which means we haven't quite made the operational and mindset shift to begin to do new things.\"\n\nEven without AI, employers across the U.K. have a productivity hill to climb. Growth in output per worker has been turgid since the global financial crisis, and continues to stump policymakers.\n\nThe Workday-commissioned research found workers were only productive for about 5.9 hours per day, meaning around a quarter of their eight-hour day was wasted time.\n\nWorkday's Pell thinks the opportunity to carry out more meaningful tasks with the help of AI should close that dead time.\n\nIf that all comes to pass, Workday estimates that \u00a3119 billion in productivity gains could be untapped at large U.K. organizations with the help of AI.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Spectral Labs, under the leadership of CEO and Founder Sishir Varghese, is at the forefront of pushing these boundaries onchain, positioning itself as a leader in the still-emerging industry. Many experts see the integration of AI agents with blockchain technology as crucial for enhancing the functionality, efficiency, and autonomy of these agents within the decentralized web.\n\nThe Power of Autonomous AI Agents\n\nThe blog post \"Redefining Onchain Interactions with Agent Wallets\" by Spectral Labs explores the potential of AI agents in the blockchain ecosystem, stating, \"The magic of engaging AI Agents (instead of humans) in the onchain world is their ability to distill context from multiple sources and information types to perform a set of deterministic logical actions.\"\n\nOnchain AI agents present unique opportunities by enabling autonomous, efficient, and secure interactions within the decentralized web. They can handle complex tasks such as trading strategies, data analysis, and smart contract operations without human intervention, leveraging blockchain's transparency and trustless environment.\n\nHowever, these agents also face challenges, including the nascent state of the technology, limited industry adoption, and the need for robust infrastructure to support their operations. Ensuring security, scalability, and user-friendly interfaces are critical to overcoming these hurdles and fully realizing the potential of onchain AI agents.\n\nIntegrating AI with Blockchain\n\nThe necessity of onchain infrastructure for AI agents stems from the need to manage the growing population of these digital entities efficiently and securely. As AI agents increasingly handle more complex tasks and interact autonomously, a robust, transparent, scalable infrastructure is crucial.\n\nBlockchain protocols and smart contracts provide this foundation, empowering AI agents by offering a decentralized, immutable ledger within a trustless environment where rules and conditions are coded and enforced automatically. By operating on a blockchain, AI agents can perform tasks, execute smart contracts, and interact with other agents without relying on centralized intermediaries, thus reducing the need for human oversight and minimizing the risk of fraud or manipulation.\n\nDecentralized digital services further benefit AI agents by providing seamless access to a wide range of resources and tools, from data storage to financial transactions. These services allow AI agents to autonomously manage wallets, execute trades, and perform other operations, creating a dynamic and efficient ecosystem that can scale with the increasing demands of AI technology.\n\nThe Game-Changer for AI Agents\n\nSYNTAX, a groundbreaking platform that streamlines the creation and deployment of AI agents, was born to harness the benefits of decentralized AI.

Democratized access means that workforces at every level can use it to help with their day job whether it's the summer intern or the CEO. In fact, our recent survey of over 3,400 C-suite leaders found that nearly 90% incorporate generative AI tools weekly and a quarter use them daily. It's become a technology of mass acceptance -- and mass impact -- across all levels of an organization in many ways.\n\nAnd in the world of mergers and acquisitions, this is more visible than in other circles.\n\nWith this pace of change and disruption today, dealmakers have told us they hope generative AI will help streamline and improve value in M&A. Our latest report, Reinventing M&A with generative AI, which surveyed 750 C-suite M&A executives found that 54% of executives say they are likely to acquire companies with AI capabilities in the next two years and 70% expect it to help yield higher returns on their transactions.\n\nHowever, our research also revealed a misalignment between high expectations for generative AI use cases and actual investments. Of the executives surveyed, a little more than half (57%) were selectively investing in generative AI for M&A processes and 8% said they weren't investing at all. Only a third (35%) said they were investing heavily.\n\nBut as executives hesitate to invest in and scale generative AI applications, they are simultaneously reacting to the rising rate of change that is confronting them today, according to Accenture's Pulse of Change Index. Most (88%) executives expect an even faster rate of change in 2024, and more than half say they aren't equipped to respond to all the changes. They also cited technology as the main cause of business change in 2023, which coincides with the rise of generative AI.\n\nGenAI's Contribution to M&A Transactions\n\nM&A executives understand why generative AI could be truly helpful to their bottom lines -- 68% revealed that more than half of their transactions failed to achieve or exceed their synergy targets within their committed timeframes. And more proof: They ranked strategy and M&A as No. 3 on their priority list of functions to reinvent.\n\nDealmaking is complex and dealmakers are big on process because they need to be. That's likely why nearly two-thirds (64%) of M&A executives anticipate generative AI will help revolutionize deal processes, as compared to other technological advancements. With generative AI comes advanced capabilities such as automated document analysis, natural language processing, context and analysis interpretation, and decision support, leading to making more informed decisions. Currently, most dealmakers are focused on using generative AI for pre-deal activities, but we see dealmakers who expand its application beyond pre-deal stages throughout M&A deal cycles can significantly enhance deal value.\n\nNavigating AI Roadblocks and Opportunities\n\nDespite signaling their readiness to adopt generative AI solutions for transaction efficiency and higher returns, executives are still figuring out how best to deploy M&A. What's holding leaders back the most is a lack of a clear focus and challenges in executing a formal strategy. From our research, we know that executives are getting their feet wet using generative AI in pre-deal stages, but many have a lack of imagination across the full spectrum of deal activities.\n\nAfter a deal closes, generative AI could be helpful in a number of ways, including:\n\nTo make the most of generative AI, executives should keep these five imperatives in mind when developing their strategy:\n\nWith the pace of change and disruption today, dealmakers are seeing the potential for generative AI to help improve value in M&A. But right now, they're lacking clarity on how to use it across the deal lifecycle. Until they figure it out, many will miss out on the efficiency and productivity benefits generative AI could bring -- not to mention potentially greater return. It's time for more M&A leaders to refocus, rebalance and proportionately align their investments to the areas that bring value while embracing reinvention.", "source": {"uri": "informationweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InformationWeek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mergers and acquisitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Synergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imperative mood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_support_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision support system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biological life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Metaprogramming", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Metaprogramming", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt69509c9116440be8/bltadf941147deff674/669685dc03028782e5de7165/handshake-new-Rawpixel_Ltd_-_alamy.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

It can improve the work of researchers, but also makes new things possible, for example in brain image analysis. At INM-1, we are currently developing an AI method to deduce where cell bodies are located directly from nerve fibre images. This is something we have not previously been able to do. AI is already helping us to reconstruct countless individual brain slices on the computer much more accurately and reliably in three dimensions, and to also digitally \"fill in\" any missing or damaged brain slices.\n\nThere are some things that AI can't necessarily do better, but that it can do much faster. For example, it usually takes a neuroanatomist several months to comprehensively map an area of the brain. We were able to show for some brain areas that AI can do good mapping work in minutes. This is not about us wanting to replace neuroanatomists, but it does mean we can create brain atlases much faster. Together with Canadian partners in the HIBALL project, we are also using findings from 'real' networks in the brain for artificial neural networks in our AI - and vice versa.\n\nAdmittedly, AI also brings huge challenges. INM generates several terabytes of research data every day. It has so far been difficult to keep up with this pace in our AI analyses. As we are constantly improving our methods, we sometimes have to reanalyse previous data. The workflow from the microscope to the online atlas is not yet fully automated, but we are working on it. We also need to ensure that AI results are correct in the first place. We can check many things by having researchers carry out the same steps manually in random samples for comparison. We are also planning separate AI programmes that detect \"surprises\" in the data stream and then raise the issue.\n\nAt the same time, we are researching how AI models can be optimally trained with as many images as possible, even if they were not previously prepared for training by humans. The wealth of data we have amassed at INM over decades is worth its weight in gold. We also want to find out whether and how brain images available on the Internet, which may be of poorer quality, can help us as additional 'training fodder'. This can't be done with pen and paper; we have to try it out with huge amounts of data. The new exascale supercomputer JUPITER will help us a lot in this regard.", "source": {"uri": "fz-juelich.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slice_preparation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slice preparation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Image analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soma (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroanatomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neuroanatomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial neural network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Byte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exascale_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exascale computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microscope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Psychology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Psychology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Neurobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Neurobiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

(D-Va.) said he is well aware of Congress's record when it comes to similar technology. \"We have to show a little humility on this,\" Warner has said. \"Our record on this stinks.\"\n\nA fellow Virginia Democrat, Rep. responded to the rise of AI by enrolling at George Mason University for a master's degree in machine learning.\n\nLocated in the heart of Silicon Valley, Stanford HAI sees itself as a nexus of innovation and education on AI. Erik Brynjolfsson, a senior fellow at HAI, teaches an \"AI Awakening\" course that features guests like Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, and Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI.\n\nLast month, as HAI marked its fifth anniversary with a daylong event at the Palo Alto campus, tech pioneer Marc Andreessen told HAI co-director Fei-Fei Li that there's \"schizophrenia in the discussions in DC\" -- with demand for guardrails in domestic policies, but a muscular approach when fending off China in the AI arms race.\n\nAndreessen, the co-founder and general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm, said government absolutely has a role, and noted how it funded supercomputing centers and fostered development of the internet.\n\nStanford says it has helped European Parliament members understand AI in the lead-up to passage this year of the EU AI Act, the globe's most comprehensive and far reaching AI regulation. And it's held workshops for employees of the US General Services Administration, an agency that helps purchase goods and services for the government.\n\nStanford's approach in educating congressional staff is simple, says Wald. \"The goal is to teach them what the technology can and cannot do.\"\n\nSome at Stanford see a special need to foster greater understanding of technology in Congress, which in 1995 shut down its Office of Technology Assessment as part of Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich's small-government \"Contract with America.\"\n\n\"When Congress does not have an office of technical assessment, it is absolutely critical that the individuals who are going to be thinking about potential legislative proposals for this technology have an understanding of the technology,\" said Daniel Ho, a law professor at Stanford, who has been part of the camp, teaching how different federal agencies use AI and machine learning.\n\n\"I've been in many of these conversations where either policymakers propose things that are technically impossible,\" he said. \"And technical folks propose things that are just flat out illegal.\"\n\n\"How do you evaluate the harm?\" said Mihir Kshirsagar, who is part of the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton. \"How do you correct the bias? And who do you hold accountable?\"\n\nStaffers from the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Trade Commission, and others, met at Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs in Washington's Dupont Circle last month to explore those questions. They were discussing a fictitious AI predictive tool using algorithms to decide whether a student should get a loan, the amount they'd receive, and their interest rate based on academic record, test scores, intended major, and other factors.\n\nThey discussed how the tool should be evaluated by regulators and audited. And explored a scenario where an academic publication finds that the tool created a high barrier for students from rural school districts and underserved urban school districts.\n\nThey also looked at test cases involving a chatbot to help military veterans with benefits, and an AI model with broad skills that could be tailored for specific use by agencies.\n\n\"Even though they had been exposed to some of these issues, they didn't know then what to do next about it,\" Kshirsagar said. \"And so trying to see and really recognizing the limits of what people know and what they're doing was a helpful part of the discussion.\"\n\nOther universities also have been consulting with Congress. Last month, members of the House financial services committee visited the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for briefings on AI and its risks in the financial sector.\n\nThe US Supreme Court's Loper Bright decision last month that overturned traditional Chevron courtroom deference to agency interpretations of complex laws could complicated the kind of legislation Congress ultimately writes on AI.\n\n\"The decision will require a greater level of specificity and intentionality for all legislation that my colleagues and I draft going forward, which is a good thing,\" said Sen. (R-Ind.), who is part of the AI caucus in the Senate.\n\nThat's where universities might especially be able to help, said Rama Chellappa, a top artificial intelligence scientist at Hopkins. Academics, he said, could step in to give some core education on key topics relating to AI legislation, ethics, and what the models are capable of doing.\n\nChellappa, who has spent more than three decades as a researcher and innovator working on AI and machine learning, said Congress needs to understand that there's no turning back.\n\n\"There are no more AI winters,\" he said. \"AI is going to be here and it's dominant.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.bloomberglaw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news.bloomberglaw.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Chatbots such as Chat GPT by OpenAI and generative AI are commonly used vocabulary in the new dialogue. Hospitals are developing ways to use AI in medical coding. Health tech and medtech companies are expanding applications for AI deployment.\n\nThe move by the Office of the National Coordinator for IT in December 2023 requiring transparency for health tech companies developing AI-driven software is a significant milestone in the story of AI in healthcare. As ONC Head Micky Tripathi observed at the time, it will spur more adoption of AI-powered tech for healthcare delivery and help produce higher quality AI tech for healthcare when it goes into effect in 2025.\n\nThis year marked another milestone -- the first time a company received marketing authorization from the FDA for an AI-enabled sepsis detection tool for hospitals. Companies also see opportunities for AI to improve clinical trial recruitment, identify targets for drug development, and more. In pharmacy benefit management, there is the potential to harness AI to automate prior authorization and formulary optimization.\n\nA new eBook from MedCity News highlights the variety of technologies emerging from AI tech developers across the healthcare landscape from health tech startups to healthcare organizations, biopharma companies, and a medtech giant.

He is principal investigator at the Cardiovascular Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He talked about his AI work with American Heart Association News as part of \"The Experts Say,\" a series in which specialists explain how they apply what they've learned to their own lives. The following interview has been edited.\n\nHow is AI being used in the field of cardiology?\n\nWe know that AI is used in every aspect of cardiology, including in the diagnosis, classification and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. I chaired the writing committee for an American Heart Association scientific statement earlier this year where we addressed the main areas in which it is applied. Some examples of how it's used include interpreting cardiac imaging and matching genetic variants to health-related traits to better understand genetic risks for disease.\n\nWe know that AI has even exceeded the performance of medical experts in some cases when interpreting cardiac imaging. It can detect subtle, non-visually detected signatures in data to make a more accurate diagnosis.\n\nHow do you use AI in your work at Massachusetts General Hospital?\n\nMy focus is to try to improve in-hospital and out-of-hospital patient monitoring.\n\nRegarding in-hospital monitoring, we want to integrate all patient-related information available in order to make the best possible decisions with these patients. That means being able to predict and prevent adverse events.\n\nWe also aim to use AI to help determine the optimal time to discharge a patient. We don't want to keep patients longer than they should be staying or discharge them faster than they should. AI can help make those decisions. It will integrate information obtained from different sources that is dynamically changing during a patient's hospital stay, such as electrocardiograms, blood pressure and electronic health records.\n\nSince we can't have a doctor next to the patient all the time, AI can collect all this data and integrate it, see if certain parameters are being exceeded. Then it can make a recommendation, perhaps that patient X should stay one extra day.\n\nWith respect to out-of-hospital monitoring, we know many, many people use wearable devices such as smartwatches that collect data, such as whether someone is having an irregular heart rhythm. Many devices are not medical grade, so we can't fully trust these data yet, but we're heading toward better technologies.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWe want to use the data these devices collect to make decisions about when a patient should be coming to the hospital. We don't want to bring someone to the hospital for a checkup without a reason, but we also don't want to bring them too late when their condition has worsened. AI can help us make better decisions about when they should come in, which could not only improve care but also reduce costs, which is another significant benefit.\n\nHow does AI account for non-measurable data, such as how a person feels?\n\nWe do need to recognize and integrate how the patient is feeling - their symptoms - into this process. We need more than a person's vital signs and how those may be fluctuating.\n\nBut there are apps that can record this by asking questions. How do you feel during or after exercise? How is your mental state? Do you have an appetite? It can be a questionnaire and the person can log into the app every day to report how they are feeling. All these states of being can be integrated with the other data we collect.\n\nDo you use AI outside of work?\n\nAI has entered every aspect of our lives, whether we know it or not.\n\nIt is used in navigation systems in the car to help us assess traffic and choose the optimal route to get somewhere. It is used to determine whether an email is spam. It is used in social media to direct our interests to certain topics. We may not pay attention to it or understand how it's being used, but it has entered our lives to stay.\n\nThe foundational principles behind AI are not new. They have been taught for many years back, but they were not called AI or machine learning. The AI research and development today is enabled by an explosion in the volume of data we collect, as well as the vastly increased computational power that is available to process these data.\n\nWhen a new technology appears, I may not use it directly in my work, but I will experiment with it. For example, I'm taking a paper I've written and I want to see how well a new application of AI can understand it, whether it can generate an accurate summary of what I wrote.\n\nI've also had discussions with my son, Alkinoos, who is a 22-year-old, second-year medical student, about a project he's doing to compare a physician's opinion in making a diagnosis to how well AI could make a correct diagnosis using the patient's symptoms, physical exam and diagnostic and lab tests. Even more importantly, he wants to know whether AI could guide the process of decision-making for a physician. Could AI help improve the prognosis or management of a case?\n\nHow might AI be used in medicine in the future?\n\nThe future is the integration of all this data. We want to take all these disparate aspects of clinical knowledge, genomics, data taken from wearable devices and electronic health records and our medical history and integrate it into systems that can make optimal predictions about a person's health.\n\nI'm fascinated by the integration of data for multi-organ systems research - that is, how medicine is starting to be addressed holistically, not focusing on a single organ problem but rather the body as a whole. For example, how a person's mental state is linked to cardiovascular disease.\n\nEach one of us is different and we need that personalized care to improve outcomes. This is the hope of AI in medicine, the transition one day to providing equitable care and improving outcomes on an individualized basis.\n\nAmerican Heart Association News\n\ncovers heart and brain health.

She is now founder and CEO of Bridge AIvisory and will be a speaker at HousingWire's AI Summit. She Part 1 of this interview is here.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nSarah Wheeler: The idea of \"responsible AI\" points to how different AI is in scope and potential (for good and bad) compared to other kinds of technology. Can you remember another time when we would apply that kind of framework to a specific technology?\n\nBrooke Anderson-Tompkins: This is a great point. I think the fact that AI is exponentially different than other technologies is why responsible AI (RAI) needs to be considered in the very beginning.\n\nI would also suggest that one of the tenants of RAI is bringing in different people earlier to the process. If you look at project planning in general, bringing individuals to the table that may have been classically downstream of the project, bringing them in sooner is better. In the case of AI, a domain expert might be your closer or your processor if you're looking holistically at how to truly enhance efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nSW: What would you say to a company that is trying to decide if they should start using AI in some form or wait for a while to see what use cases are best for their business? Will they get left too far behind if they don't jump in now?\n\nBAT: Well, one of my favorite quotes from Berkeley was you don't have to start in the deep end. [Berkeley's Haas School of Business offers a certificate in AI business strategy and application] I think that you start simple, include your people early and often, and help them to overcome the headline that AI is going to take their job. Very few people work well in fear mode, so that needs to be part of the strategy in relationship to the adoption piece. You have to think about how you help the organization not be afraid of all the things that might be in the headlines, and then take steps to upskill and reskill.\n\nOne example I can offer is, building a prompt library, which is a gentle way to start. If there is an opportunity to use a large language model (LLM) and get accurate answers, that helps with efficiency, which is more likely done when you help build the appropriate prompts. Then people are going to lean in because they're they're going to see that there's actually some relief instead of just learning and doing more.\n\nI do think that it's important to start now. And companies that do this, the pre-work could actually make the difference in defining the outcome of the AI project. There's a statistic that says that 87% of AI use cases fail to come out of test now. That's a huge number! Now, mind you, that stat is from last fall, but still, it's a big number. So I think there's no better time to start than the present. And not because I say so, but because the research supports it. But there are some alterations to the approach that can definitively have an effect on the outcome.\n\nSW: For more mature businesses, what are some of the things they are grappling with?\n\nI think it's the use cases -- do they actually play out the way that you originally identified? For example, data. I heard a quote the other day that data is the new oil. So, is the data in a format that's readily usable? Or does it take more time, for example, and was that time built into the project, because they may or may not have recognized that as necessary when they were putting together the process.\n\nI think that it's unique to each organization on how mature they are in this process. And mature doesn't necessarily mean age -- it means if an organization has a greater propensity towards technology to begin with, their answers and their choices are likely going to be driven differently than organizations that may not have that underlying premise. And there are variations of risks associated with that.\n\nSW: Are you an AI optimist or do you see danger ahead when it comes to AI?\n\nBAT: My glass is always half full! And, I think it serves business well to be an optimist -- and also be a realist. But in this particular case, I would say that I believe in the tech-forward approach with the 'heart of human' at its core.\n\nGood and evil have existed since the beginning of time and the stakes here could potentially be exponentially higher. So as we go well beyond the industry changes or challenges that that we're accustomed to, I absolutely feel emphatically that we need to get it right. And getting it right is going to take a village. And we're in housing -- we know how to build villages! So now is actually a great time to lean into possible.", "source": {"uri": "housingwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HousingWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_wheeler@housingwire.com", "name": "Sarah Wheeler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAI", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(supercomputer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summit (supercomputer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_School_of_Business", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haas School of Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Master of Laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Berkeley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exponential growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strategic management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Realism (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Optimism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_and_evil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good and evil"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.housingwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/AdobeStock_210039553-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

The document has since been signed and supported by dozens of universities and other tech companies that agreed to share their insights and knowledge to further a responsible use of AI.\n\nThe Church of England, influential Jewish rabbis and Muslim leaders also joined the call for an ethical approach to big data and AI.\n\nAt the memorial park in Hiroshima, Eastern leaders from Buddhist, Hindu, Zoroastrian and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed traditions came together for what the Vatican described as a \"historic multireligious event.\"\n\n\"I ask you to show the world that we are united in asking for a proactive commitment to protect human dignity in this new era of machine,\" Pope Francis wrote in a message read by Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, president of the Academy for Life, which under this pontificate has expanded its scope to include issues that impact all aspects of human life, from technology to palliative care to migration.\n\nPaglia asked that AI, which he described as \"a great tool with unlimited possibilities of application,\" become \"a driver of peace and reconciliation among peoples.\" His words were echoed by Sheikh Abdallah Bin Bayyah, president of the Abu Dhabi Forum for Peace and chair of the United Arab Emirates Council for Fatwa, who invoked \"a future in which the fruits of technology are harnessed to build a more tolerant, peaceful and virtuous world.\"\n\nRabbi Eliezer Simcha Weiss, a member of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel's Commission for Interfaith Relations, added, \"AI strengthens our faith in God, providing avenues for exploring the intricacies of creation and the mysteries of existence.\"\n\nFrancis' adviser for AI, the Rev. Paolo Benanti, presented a second document, the \"Hiroshima Appeal,\" which urges world leaders to use the technology for peace and to resolve conflicts for a cessation of all violence.\n\nGetting Muslim and Jewish representatives to sit together at the table was no easy feat, said the Rev. Paolo Ciucci, a Catholic priest who works on AI issues at the Vatican who attended and helped coordinate the event, in an interview on Thursday (July 18).\n\n\"What's important is that everyone agreed to participate,\" Ciucci said.\n\n\"If we sit down to discuss theology among religions we will never get out of it alive,\" he added, \"but if we do something for the betterment of humanity we can all sit at the table.\"\n\nCiucci works alongside 150 scientists and experts at the Academy for Life attempting to infuse an ethical sense into the rapidly developing field of AI. He is also the secretary general of RenAIssance, a foundation whose brief is to promote the Rome Call for AI Ethics among leaders in the field of AI.\n\nFrancis has launched a powerful effort to address the topic in the church, sending priests to discuss AI with engineers from Silicon Valley to Nairobi, Kenya, and exploiting formal and informal channels.\n\nWith his ironed black shirt and white collar, Ciucci said he stands out in a crowd of developers and programmers who often ask him what a Catholic priest is doing in conferences about algorithms and big data. At a conference called AI for Good, held every year in Geneva, IBM's AI Ethics Global Leader Francesca Rossi walked up to Ciucci and asked: \"Excuse me, why are you here?\"\n\nCiucci published a book answering that question in 2022. \"We tackle AI because we believe that technology in general, but this one especially, influences the lives of human beings. Since we care about humanity we are here,\" he explained.\n\nNo technology is neutral, Ciucci said. It is up to people to ensure that culture, society and economics don't create inherent biases. AI, he said, challenges the question of what it means to be human, and as \"an agency that is an expert of the flesh,\" the Catholic Church has a lot to offer to experts in the field.\n\nIBM was among the first signatories of the Rome Call, and the company has supported the Vatican's outreach to universities around the globe. \"Everything in the document is not written from the point of view of one specific religion but it has a human-centric approach and values that are shared by the Catholic religions and other religions,\" Rossi told Religion News Service in an interview Wednesday.\n\nRossi, who serves on numerous boards focused on AI ethics, said technology firms' clients are increasingly asking for reassurance that AI does not violate bias, discrimination or privacy norms. \"Technology can and should be used to help human progress, not the other way around,\" she said.\n\nRossi said the Hiroshima gathering, despite being held in a place haunted by almost unimaginable violence, was focused on peace. \"The people of Hiroshima turned the narrative around,\" she said, adding that the signatories of the Rome Call hope to do the same for AI.\n\nThe Vatican promises to continue being a voice for an ethical use for AI, centered on the promotion of peace. Summits with international organizations and events for the five-year anniversary of the Rome Call are already in the works, hinting at the Vatican's and Pope Francis' determination to ensure that AI becomes an instrument for good.", "source": {"uri": "religionnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Religion News Service"}, "authors": [{"uri": "claire_giangrave@religionnews.com", "name": "Claire

As companies integrate AI into their operations, there is growing optimism about its potential to enhance productivity and reshape economic landscapes. This sentiment is a contributing factor reflected in rising stock prices, especially in sectors that stand to benefit the most from AI-driven innovations.\n\nThe heart of this investor optimism lies in AI's ability to increase the output per employee, a metric that has, historically, been a cornerstone of economic growth. Companies are not just automating routine tasks; they are leveraging AI to make strategic decisions, optimize logistics and foster innovation. Such advancements promise to boost productivity by unprecedented margins, explaining why every uptick in AI development sends ripples through the stock market.\n\nHowever, the implications of AI extend beyond mere productivity enhancements. There is a growing belief among economists that AI's widespread adoption could be instrumental in calming down the level of inflation. By increasing efficiency and reducing costs, AI could help stabilize prices and align them closer to economic fundamentals. This potential has not gone unnoticed by investors, who see AI as a dual force capable of driving growth and mitigating inflationary pressures.\n\nAmidst this backdrop, retirement and investment statements featuring recent impressive gains prompted celebrations among investors. Yet, optimism should come with some caution, reminding everyone that while the trajectory is upward, markets can quickly move in different directions. They do not move in a straight line; corrections are often part of the journey.\n\nThere is also growing speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates in September in response to evolving economic indicators. Such a move would typically signal lower borrowing costs, potentially encouraging more investments in the stock market. The anticipation of this has added a layer of complexity to the market's movements, with investors trying to time their entries and exits to maximize returns.\n\nMoreover, while AI is a powerful driver of market enthusiasm, it is not the sole player. Other factors such as geopolitical tensions, regulatory changes, future tax policies, and macroeconomic shifts, also weave into the narrative, influencing market sentiment and investor behavior. The challenge for investors in any market is to discern how much of the market's movement is genuinely rooted in AI's potential versus short-term speculations.\n\nLooking ahead, the trajectory for AI and its impact on markets appears overwhelmingly positive. Businesses are increasingly viewing AI not just as a tool for operational efficiency but as a strategic asset that can define their competitive edge. As AI technologies evolve and their applications become more profound, their influence on stock markets is expected to deepen.\n\nSo, take a moment and enjoy looking at what should be rising balances on those investment statements.", "source": {"uri": "eptrail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Estes Park Trail-Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rich_flanery@eptrail.com", "name": "Rich Flanery", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metric system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_indicator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic indicator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Strategic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Strategic", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.eptrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/TGC-Z-FLANNERY.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

It also has an environmental focus.\n\nThe fund invested in ClimateAI in 2021 with several other groups. According to its website, ClimateAI \"has built the first climate resilience platform, pioneering the application of artificial intelligence to mitigate the impact of climate change and uncover new opportunities that may arise as a result.\"\n\nAshton Kutcher and music manager Guy Oseary co-founded investing firm Sound Venture, which last year included companies OpenAI, Anthropic and Stability AI in its portfolio.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nHowever, the \"That '70s Show\" star faced backlash last month after he made comments praising OpenAI's generative video tool, Sora.\n\nImpressed by its abilities, Kutcher noted it would cut down on production costs and possibly lead to a future where anyone could generate a movie based on their own ideas.\n\n\"You'll be able to render a whole movie. You'll just come up with an idea for a movie, then it will write the script. Then you'll input the script into the video generator, and it will generate the movie,\" he said, Variety reported. \"Instead of watching some movie that somebody else came up with, I can just generate and then watch my own movie.\"\n\nKutcher was criticized on social media for appearing to advocate replacing crew members and actors' jobs.\n\nFollowing the backlash, Kutcher took to X to address his comments.\n\nEMILY BLUNT ADMITS NEW TECHNOLOGY IS 'SOMETHING WE'RE ALL NERVOUS ABOUT'\n\n\"I don't think AI will replace the film industry or creative arts. It's an amazing tool that we should learn to work with to become more prolific and efficient as artist. In the same way we use Avid, final draft, greenscreen, Led bg and other technical tools.

There use to be someone that checked the gate,\" he continued. \"We need to be prepared and understand what's coming.\"\n\nOther celebrities in the movie and music worlds are seeking regulation for the technology.\n\nIn April, over 200 musicians signed a letter speaking out about their rights when it comes to AI, including Katy Perry and Miranda Lambert.\n\nSHERYL CROW BLASTS DRAKE FOR USING AI TO REPLICATE TUPAC SHAKUR'S VOICE: 'IT'S HATEFUL'\n\n\"We, the undersigned members of the artist and songwriting communities, call on AI developers, technology companies, platforms and digital music services to cease the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists,\" the letter began.\n\nThe open letter was submitted by the Artist Rights Alliance, a non-profit made up of \"working musicians, performers and songwriters fighting for a healthy creative economy and fair treatment for all creators in the digital world,\" according to its official website.\n\nThe letter notes that \"AI has enormous potential to advance human creativity\" when used \"responsibly.\"\n\n\"This assault on human creativity must be stopped. We must protect against the predatory use of AI to steal professional artists' voices and likenesses, violate creators' rights, and destroy the music ecosystem,\" the letter continues.\n\n\"I think AI has no place in Hollywood at all. To me, tech should solve problems that humans have,\" Batemen told Fox News Digital. \"Using ChatGPT or any ... software that's using AI to write screenplays, using that in place of a writer is not solving a problem.

But that's in no way a reflection of their interest in technology and eagerness to adopt generative AI tools.\n\nIn fact, 68% of female respondents to a new survey from Women Go Tech have used at least one AI tool -- hands down, the No. 1 preferred is ChatGPT -- and 61% said they wanted to learn more about AI tools and applications.\n\nStill, women can be hesitant initially due to insecurities fueled by age-old biases and discrimination, as well as fears about data privacy and ethical use of the technology, the survey discovered.\n\n\"Women are generally very interested in AI and its potential applications but often hesitate to engage deeply with AI tools,\" Women Go Tech writes in a report summarizing the findings. \"The technical nature of AI and prevailing gender stereotypes may lead many women to feel less confident about their ability to effectively use and understand AI tools. This lack of confidence is a significant barrier that prevents them from fully engaging with the technology.\"\n\nDiscrimination, bias, 'Matilda Syndrome' still persist\n\nSupported by Google.org and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the survey polled 5,400 respondents from 13 European countries. Women were split into four categories: those interested in tech careers (31%), those not interested in tech careers (30%), those who have worked in tech for more than 2 years (27%) and those who have worked in the tech sector for less than two years (12%).\n\nOf the aspiring technologists, 77% were interested in AI, while 64.6% of tech sector novices and 63.9% of experienced talent said they wanted to learn about the technology.\n\nBeyond ChatGPT, those who had tried out the technology tinkered with OpenAI Codex, Bard/Gemini and GPT-4.

The temptation is to override the mechanics of democratic law-making in favour of speed to reflect the urgency of the matter.\n\n\"If you're a dictator, you can probably have an AI Act tomorrow. I would say let's rather move a little slower and make sure we include everyone, because we're such a diverse country, than lean more toward an Orwellian kind of world where we don't care what you think, we're just going to legislate to get it over and done with.\"\n\nAlthough the Department of Communications and Digital Technologies recently released a draft AI strategy document on the subject, it follows in the wake of countries in the 'Global North', which are finalising their stance on the subject and producing regulation and legislation.\n\n\"The best example for me is the EU AI Act, which is still not enacted into law, although the member states have accepted it. There are a lot of principles in it that I think other regions will probably follow; hopefully, we in South Africa will as well, but we have to flavour it from an African, our own society's, point of view,\" he says.\n\nOn SA's draft national AI plan, Steyn, who is an advisor on the CSIR National AI Working Group, says it's good to have a starting point, but recognises the document is vague and leans heavily towards academia.\n\n\"My worry is that this initiative could be a great way to produce more papers, speak at more conferences and the like, but if that little boy running barefoot in Soweto, if his life is not changed through the work we're doing in regulation in the next few years, then what are we doing?\"\n\nThere are numerous reasons and areas where regulation is a necessity, from protection of the environment, through to protecting the rights of companies and individuals, and reducing programmed bias.\n\nOne aspect of the growth of AI that rarely gets discussed, is that it is more compute-intensive than traditional workloads; the additional power, cooling and water consumption involved will have an increased impact on the environment.\n\nSteyn says: \"When OpenAI released ChatGPT, up until then, to train a model, it consumed 1 078KWh of electricity and produced something like 550 tonnes of carbon. That was before they released it. It [the environmental impact] is something that's not talked about enough. These organisations are aiming for net zero; how they're going to get it right with where we are now, I don't know.\n\n\"With the AI arms race, it will probably increase what we do to our environment in the next quarter century or so.\"\n\nSteyn also highlights some of the disruptions AI is already causing in society, including the recent strikes in Hollywood over the image and voice rights of actors being signed away and the threat AI will be able to create digital replicas of them.\n\n\"In our country, we have nothing in the way of regulatory protections on artists and art as far as it goes with deepfakes.\"\n\nThe deepfakes issue could also affect legal cases, and the level of trust that can be placed on video or audio evidence in court, as well as the use of the technology in cyber bullying or for 'revenge porn'.\n\nThere are many other potential areas where AI can impact society, he adds. And while there is a need to get regulation in place, enforceability will be a key challenge for South Africa.\n\n\"If we look at our country with POPIA [Protection of Personal Information Act] at the moment - great legislation, but the enforceability, the court cases, the costs in calling to task those who have violated it, it takes so long. If we can't get that right, what are we going to do with AI in our jurisdiction and across the world?\"", "source": {"uri": "itweb.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITWeb"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adrian_hinchcliffe@itweb.co.za", "name": "Adrian Hinchcliffe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Steyn_(rugby_union)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Johan Steyn (rugby union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran\u00e7ois_Steyn", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fran\u00e7ois Steyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disruptive innovation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soweto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soweto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Soweto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental issues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_arms_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence arms race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_porn", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenge porn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyberbullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental protection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2024/07/Johan-Steyn-Jul-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

As of June 2024, there are simply too many unknowns. The use of AI and its abilities is growing at an almost geometric rate, and this growth is making it difficult for governments and organizations to develop frameworks that will ensure AIs and Large Language Modules (LLM) are properly used and abide by the privacy regulations that are already in place.\n\nAn International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) study clearly shows public concern. The 2023 IAPP Privacy and Consumer Trust report found 68% of consumers globally are either somewhat or very concerned about their privacy online. Most find it difficult to understand what types of data about them are being collected and used. The diffusion of AI is one of the newest factors to drive these concerns, with 57% of consumers globally agreeing that AI poses a significant threat to their privacy. Additionally, in a recent Pew Research Center survey, 81% of consumers think the information collected by AI companies will be used in ways people are uncomfortable with and in ways the collectors did not originally intend.\n\nBarry O'Connell, General Manager EMEA, Trustwave, noted there is a broader discussion to be conducted and decisions to be made regarding privacy, but these must be done intelligently and with a great deal of nuance.\n\n\"As AI becomes more pervasive, an organization needs to understand how this technology is managed. Having governments provide frameworks on data privacy, employment legislation, etc., makes sense,\" O'Connell said. \"Having governments make decisions on specific functionality or technology is sub-optimal, not to mention nearly always reactionary. Challenges like the ability for a system to create an explorable timeline of a PC's past usage will be coming thick and fast.\"\n\nWhat organizations need, O'Connell said, is an AI adoption framework and a related governance structure to assess how this technology should and should not be used within the context of providing a safe and secure environment for the employees, data, IP, customers, partners, etc. Legislation should form the parameters, but organizations must take responsibility for the situational use of AI within their business.\n\nEd Williams, Vice President EMEA, Trustwave SpiderLabs, agreed, saying he does not want to see the government take a heavy hand to this as AI is a transformational technology, and he would not want a nation to fall behind because of concerns that are unfounded and/or short-sighted.\n\nWilliams would like to see new data collection features turned \"off\" by default, allowing organizations and users to enable data collection features as they see fit to maximize privacy while ensuring necessary information is still collected. It's important to have a level of granularity where the organization and user can differentiate between what is required and what isn't, he said.\n\nThere is also a historical backdrop to these privacy concerns, as collecting data on workers is not a new idea.\n\n\"As a counterbalance to this, the context of where and when this is happening is key. It is worth remembering that 'employee activity monitoring' has been around for a while and is there to ensure appropriate behavior; think of the finance sector and insider trading as an example,\" Williams said. \"The health service has monitoring to ensure that health care practitioners only view the records they are meant to review as part of their role.\"\n\nThere are also security issues at play that governments must keep in mind when considering interfering with AI development.\n\n\"From a cybersecurity perspective, these tools are, and will continue to be, used by adversaries. This means that in addition to gaining an understanding of the legitimate use of these tools, organizations need to factor in their malicious use and how to protect against it. Bad actors don't play by the rules,\" O'Connell said. \"No amount of legislation will stop cybercriminals and malicious nation-states from maximizing the use of this technology to achieve their goals.\"\n\nThe evolving landscape of AI necessitates a smarter and more responsive approach to cybersecurity. AI offers immense potential to fortify defenses by streamlining threat response, proactive threat hunting, and in-depth data analysis.

It usually contains a short text answer, an image if relevant, and supporting links.\n\nAccording to Schiff's office, citing numerous reports, AI Overview has a tendency to output incorrect and/or potentially dangerous information.\n\nThe complaint, published by Schiff's office and co-signed by four other members of congress, requests answers to eleven questions about the feature related to the company's efforts to ensure greater accuracy and safety.\n\nAI Overview\n\nSome of the issues with AI Overview stems from its apparent inability to determine whether a given source is satire or not. \"Google's AI Overviews feature told users to eat at least one rock a day for vitamins and minerals,\" wrote Schiff and the other members of congress, adding that the AI was citing satire news site \"The Onion.\"\n\nIn other cases, such as when users began reporting that AI overview claimed Barack Obama was the first Muslim US president, the AI system directly cited debunked conspiracy theories.\n\nSchiff's letter acknowledged Google's ongoing efforts to combat misinformation, but stated that more needs to be done:\n\n\"We appreciate Google's efforts to fix these errors by improving the feature through continued testing, taking down responses that violate the company's content policies, and labeling AI-generated responses as experimental. However, more must be done to adequately ensure that Google can remain a trustworthy and reliable source of information for Americans.\"\n\nAI reasoning\n\nAs of now, there's no scientific consensus that these kinds of problems can actually be solved. The gist of the problem is that AI doesn't \"think\" or \"reason,\" despite both terms being commonly used in marketing for AI products.\n\nGenerative AI systems imitate human speech but lack the ability to understand context or apply earned experience to a situation.\n\nThese problems are long outstanding in the field and were noticed in early large language models such as OpenAI's GPT-2 and Meta's now defunct \"Galactica\" system which was taken down after only three days over the backlash its launch created.\n\nUS demands\n\nIn order to further understand Google's efforts, Schiff and his fellow lawmakers have demanded that Pichai and Google respond by August 1 with answers to a list of 11 questions. These include queries about the company's ranking procedures, automated fact-checking, accuracy, sourcing, transparency, and how it's working with authorities to ensure safety.", "source": {"uri": "cointelegraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cointelegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tristan_greene@cointelegraph.com", "name": "Tristan Greene", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sundar Pichai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Onion", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GPT-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus_on_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scientific consensus on climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact-checking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fact-checking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=90,width=1200/https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-07/34e10b33-02f4-459d-9db1-3b6ebd87caa6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 119, "textEnd": 127, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Disclosure information is available on the original site.\n\n___\n\nAuthor: Luana Carcano, Lecturer, Beedie School of Business, Simon Fraser University\n\nFashion is a dynamic business. Most apparel brands make at least two to four collections per year. While selling current seasonal collections, brands plan for the next ones at least a year in advance, identifying market trends and materials. The selling window is around three months, and unsold inventories represent financial loss.\n\nFast fashion companies introduce new lines even more frequently, reducing the amount of time needed to design, produce and market new items.\n\nTech and fashion\n\nThe fashion industry is familiar with experimenting with technological frontiers. Some of the most significant technological breakthrough are laser cutting, computer-aided design and more recently, the use of 3D printing in early 2010.\n\nThe fashion industry has experimented with basic AI and other cutting-edge technologies. One example is the Gucci Garden, the label's collaboration with virtual world platform Roblox in May 2021 to celebrate the brand's centennial.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are another area of innovation, as seen with the Dolce & Gabbana Genesi Collection in collaboration with UNXD, a digital luxury marketplace. This collection sold for US$6 million, setting a record for NFT sales.\n\nFashion companies also use blockchains for product authentication, traceability and digital IDs, including those integrated by LVMH/Louis Vuitton, product authentication and traceability.\n\nAdditionally, companies have incorporated augmented reality into marketing and retail strategies to create immersive and interactive customer experiences.\n\nGame-changing technology\n\nIn 2021, fashion companies invested between 1.6 and 1.8 per cent of their revenues in technology. By 2030, that figure is expected to rise to between three and 3.5 per cent.\n\nGenerative AI could become a game-changer for the fashion industry, adding between US$150 and US$250 billion to operating profits within three to five years. While the fashion sector has only started integrating AI, the opportunities and challenges it presents are evident across all business processes.\n\nGenerative AI could help fashion companies improve their processes, bring their products to the market faster, sell more efficiently and improve customer experience. Generative AI could also support product development by analyzing large social media and runway show datasets to identify emerging fashion trends.\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder Companies and Microsoft have teamed up to open an in-house AI innovation lab for identifying and responding to trends, informing product development and improving customer experiences.\n\nDesigners could use AI to visualize different materials and patterns based on past consumer preferences. For example, the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation is collaborating with IBM and the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York on the Reimagine Retail project, which uses AI to analyze consumer data and design new fashion collections.\n\nDesigners can also convert sketches and mood boards into 3D designs and 3D print them to speed up prototyping. Iris van Herpen, a Dutch fashion designer, used AI to imagine and execute the visuals of her fall/winter 2023 collection.\n\nNOWNESS looks at Dutch designer Iris van Herpen's imaginative uses of AI.\n\nAI and sustainability\n\nAI helps in creating more sustainable fashion practices by optimizing the use of resources, recycling materials and reducing waste through more precise manufacturing processes and efficient supply chain and inventory management. For example, H&M uses AI to improve its recycling processes, sort and categorize garments for recycling and promote a circular fashion economy.\n\nAI can improve operations and supply chain processes by optimizing inventory management, predicting sales based on historical data, and reducing overstock and stock-outs. Brands like Zara and H&M already use AI to control supply chains, promoting sustainability by optimizing stock levels and reducing waste. Zara also introduced AI and robotics into their retail stores to speed up online order pick-ups.\n\nAI-powered virtual try-on solutions allow customers to see how clothes will look on them without physically trying them, enhancing the online shopping experience and reducing return rates. Virtual try-ons are already a reality in digital companies, such as prescription eyewear retailer Warby Parker and Amazon.\n\nAnother example is Modiface, acquired by French multinational personal care company L'Or\u00e9al in 2018, which provides AR-based virtual try-ons for makeup and fashion accessories.\n\nEffective campaigning\n\nAI can also deliver customized customer experiences. Some brands, such as Reebok and Versace, invite their customers to use AI tools to design products inspired by the brand's feel and look.\n\nAI-powered tools can help marketing teams target and maximize the impact of their communication campaigns, potentially reducing marketing costs.\n\nThe fashion business includes everything from small companies to global chains, haute couture to ready-to-wear, mass market and fast fashion. Each brand must understand where AI could generate value for their business without diluting their brand identity.\n\nThe biggest challenge, however, is to avoid homogenization. Generative AI should not replace human creativity but create new spaces and processes.\n\nCreativity and innovation remain the soul and heart of any fashion brand, and AI should be a tool to enhance and support them. As fashion designer Hussein Chalayan has said, \"fashion will renew itself through technology, new fibers, new ways of making clothes.\"\n\nAI pitfalls\n\nFashion companies should be prepared to manage the associated risks with new technologies, particularly regarding intellectual property, creative rights and brand reputation. One of the primary issues is the potential infringement of intellectual property related to training data.\n\nGenAI models are trained on vast design datasets, often containing copyrighted works. This can lead to legal disputes over originality and ownership. A related risk is bias and fairness in generative-AI systems, which may present reputational challenges for brands that rely on the technology.\n\nThe ambiguity surrounding creative rights in the age of AI is another concern. It's challenging to determine who holds the creative rights to a design, whether it's the designer who conceptualized the idea, the developer who built the AI or the AI itself. This ambiguity can dilute the authenticity of a brand's creative expression, potentially harming its reputation if consumers perceive the brand as less innovative or authentic.\n\n___\n\nLuana Carcano does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\n\n___\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

You can read the previous installment here.\n\nFor the past 18 months, artificial intelligence has been the drumbeat of the tech world, and it's triggered an identity crisis for many SaaS startups.\n\nAs investors have redirected their coffers toward AI opportunities, many startups have decided they need to become AI companies.\n\n\"I think there's this perception, sometimes real and sometimes exaggerated, that either because of a talent gap or a knowledge gap, AI remains inaccessible, and I think in general, that's not true.\"\n\nBut Scott Loong, partner at Panache Ventures, said this pivot is often unnecessary and unsuccessful. He spends much of his time figuring out if companies are AI-native or AI-enabled, and said it's a distinction more founders need to consider.\n\n\"No one needs to be convinced that these products are powerful,\" he said. \"The motivation to adopt is extremely high.\"\n\nBut amid the sudden scramble by companies to pivot to AI, Loong believes SaaS leaders need to think about what they can plausibly do with the resources on hand.\n\n\"What a lot of startups are wondering about now is what they have access to, given their existing team of engineers,\" he said.\n\nLoong, who knows this area well -- having founded and exited his own AI and insurtech startup -- believes that startups who don't offer AI as a core product shouldn't try to reinvent the wheel to stay competitive.\n\n\"I think there's this perception, sometimes real and sometimes exaggerated, that either because of a talent gap or a knowledge gap, AI remains inaccessible, and I think in general, that's not true,\" Loong added.\n\nBuilding and running large language models are incredibly expensive endeavours, requiring specialized chips, large amounts of computing power, and highly skilled engineers. While creating a tailor-made AI solution from scratch might seem to offer a competitive advantage, Loong believes that for most startups, it's simply not necessary.\n\nFor most seed to Series A startups, off-the-shelf AI tools are sufficient to achieve their goals, and Loong said purchasing or licensing these solutions can be more practical and cost-effective than building them from the ground up.\n\n\"Take your typical B2B SaaS company -- they're not going to have either the resources or the need for very, very sophisticated in-house AI knowledge,\" he said. \"In those situations, they should be looking for the low-hanging fruit in their operations that are currently being done by a group of individuals in a repetitive drudgery sort of way.\"\n\nEric Sleeth, Senior Product Marketing Manager at Sage, said the rise of AI has created a hype similar to that of the Cloud ten years ago, and agrees with Loong that leaders should focus more on the business problems that AI can solve.\n\n\"AI is a resource multiplier.\"\n\n\"Startups thrive on innovation and efficiency, and AI catalyzes both,\" Sleeth said. \"AI is a resource multiplier; enhancing productivity and reducing operational cost, allowing startups to scale rapidly without proportional increases in workforce.\"\n\nAccounting and finance teams, for example, often spend countless hours on tasks like data entry, budgeting, reconciliation, generating reports, and analyzing data to make future projections and business decisions. These are all functions that can be easily automated by AI, yet according to a 2023 report, more than 60 percent of finance executives aren't yet using it.\n\nSleeth noted that finance teams are particularly bogged down by a rigid finance system and lengthy processes, which make them ripe for AI transformation. \"A SaaS startup's superpower is the ability to be nimble and innovate,\" he said, adding that AI can enable finance teams to operate more like startups.\n\nSage designed its AI-powered Copilot solution to help finance leaders, accountants, small businesses, and HR leaders automate the drudgery tasks and free up time of leaders to focus on improving the business.\n\nThe solution also uses adaptive learning algorithms to analyze each business processes and decision-making patterns. It's also built with natural language processing capabilities, making it ideal for SaaS startups without in-house technical expertise.\n\nSleeth, for his part, sees finance teams \"begging\" to do more value-added work, rather than being overwhelmed with manual, time-consuming tasks.\n\n\"AI can free up human resources, and this is just scratching the surface,\" Sleeth added. \"We will see more advanced finance teams start to use AI to enhance human capabilities like monitoring compliance, anomaly detection, and providing deeper insights into financial performance, customer behavior, and market trends.\"", "source": {"uri": "betakit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BetaKit"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isabelle_kirkwood@betakit.com", "name": "Isabelle Kirkwood", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software as a service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_A_round", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Series A round"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competitive advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial off-the-shelf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business-to-business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anomaly detection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_behaviour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer behaviour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Value added"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Scott-Loong.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Unsurprisingly, these announcements boosted AAPL stock to new all-time highs.\n\nThis has many investors reconsidering the company as an AI laggard, instead choosing to focus on the company as a key AI ecosystem machine in the making.\n\nThat could certainly be the case. But as with all such catalysts, time will be the ultimate judge.\n\nFor now, AAPL stock certainly doesn't appear to be an exciting growth stock it once was. Growth has slowed. And while AI is seemingly poised to be the accelerant for the company's earnings growth profile, we'll have to wait and see how the company's upcoming product releases actually perform.\n\nLet's dive more into whether Apple is a buy at current levels, considering the run it's been on this year.\n\nWedbush Securities has been among the most bullish names on Apple in the past. The firm's key analyst Dan Ives recently noted that megacap tech stocks could see a 15% rise in the second half 2024, driven by AI.\n\nIves emphasized the growing $4 trillion AI arms race among major tech players, likening GPU chips to the new oil or gold. He predicted strong Nasdaq performance ahead, with tech stocks expected to rise by 15% because of expanding AI applications.\n\nIves believes the AI rally could extend to tech firms with strong installed bases capable of using generative AI.\n\nLast month, Ives told CNBC that the tech bull market could last at least two more years. He outlined a potential \"tech cold war\" with China as a contained threat. The AI boom, which he called the \"fourth industrial revolution,\" is expanding beyond semiconductors to other companies.\n\nApple is also a top choice on Dan Ives for the second half 2024. To add to the optimism, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also believes in Apple's competitive edge on AI. Not only that, Deepwater Asset Management also thinks Apple is a better long-term bet than Nvidia.\n\nApple announced major AI changes to Siri at its WWDC event, but the release date for this upgrade remains unclear.\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman, known for accurate Apple leaks, reported in his Power On newsletter that Apple Intelligence AI will debut this fall, with significant Siri updates arriving next spring.\n\nThese updates will enable Siri to access and work with other Apple apps via simple commands, such as retrieving a driver's license number from a photo.\n\nAccording to Gurman, Siri will get a design overhaul and ChatGPT integration this fall but will lack key contextual features. These features will be beta-tested by developers in January and publicly released in spring 2025.\n\nApple's June news release confirmed that Apple Intelligence would start in beta this fall, with additional features rolling out over the next year.\n\nApple entered the AI space two years after ChatGPT's launch, opting for a collaborative approach by integrating ChatGPT and allowing AI models from other competitors.\n\nIt's true that some level of improved enthusiasm should circulate around Apple right now. If the company can integrate AI into its offerings well, the company's operating leverage could propel a new wave of earnings growth the likes of which we haven't seen in some time.\n\nThe thing is, at current valuations, AAPL stock certainly looks like a relatively slow-growth stock that's expensive.\n\nI'm cautious on Apple, but I'm also an observer that's been wrong in the past when I thought this stock has been expensive. Maybe the market is getting the AI trade right on this name - time will tell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It can improve the work of researchers, but also makes new things possible, for example in brain image analysis. At INM-1, we are currently developing an AI method to deduce where cell bodies are located directly from nerve fibre images. This is something we have not previously been able to do. AI is already helping us to reconstruct countless individual brain slices on the computer much more accurately and reliably in three dimensions, and to also digitally \"fill in\" any missing or damaged brain slices.\n\nThere are some things that AI can't necessarily do better, but that it can do much faster. For example, it usually takes a neuroanatomist several months to comprehensively map an area of the brain. We were able to show for some brain areas that AI can do good mapping work in minutes. This is not about us wanting to replace neuroanatomists, but it does mean we can create brain atlases much faster. Together with Canadian partners in the HIBALL project, we are also using findings from 'real' networks in the brain for artificial neural networks in our AI - and vice versa.\n\nAdmittedly, AI also brings huge challenges. INM generates several terabytes of research data every day. It has so far been difficult to keep up with this pace in our AI analyses. As we are constantly improving our methods, we sometimes have to reanalyse previous data. The workflow from the microscope to the online atlas is not yet fully automated, but we are working on it. We also need to ensure that AI results are correct in the first place. We can check many things by having researchers carry out the same steps manually in random samples for comparison. We are also planning separate AI programmes that detect \"surprises\" in the data stream and then raise the issue.\n\nAt the same time, we are researching how AI models can be optimally trained with as many images as possible, even if they were not previously prepared for training by humans. The wealth of data we have amassed at INM over decades is worth its weight in gold. We also want to find out whether and how brain images available on the Internet, which may be of poorer quality, can help us as additional 'training fodder'. This can't be done with pen and paper; we have to try it out with huge amounts of data.

Meanwhile, in Thailand, various AI ethical guidelines have been introduced by relevant agencies since 2022 to raise awareness of ethics among those providing or utilizing AI-related services. However, the absence of enforceable regulations for this burgeoning technology remains conspicuous. In this newsletter, we aim to shed light on Thailand's current stance towards AI regulations.\n\nIn the past few years, we have seen two legislative developments in Thailand that share the same approach as that of the EU AI Act as follows:\n\n1. Draft Royal Decree on Business Operations that Use Artificial Intelligence Systems (\"Draft Royal Decree\")\n\nThe Draft Royal Decree was proposed by the Office of the National Digital Economy and Society Commission (\"ONDE\") to be issued under the Electronic Transactions Act, B.E. 2544 (2001) (\"ETA\"). The Draft Royal Decree aims to implement suitable control and prevention measures based on the severity of the potential effects arising from the operation of service businesses that utilize AI systems, in order to build trust and acceptance in electronic data systems, and to prevent harm to the public.\n\nThe Draft Royal Decree, which underwent a public hearing in October 2022, was significantly influenced by the then-draft EU AI Act. It remains to be seen how the Draft Royal Decree will evolve.\n\nWe highlight below the essential provisions of the Draft Royal Decree, all of which are similar to those of the EU AI Act.\n\n1.1 Risk-Based Approach\n\nSimilarly to the EU AI Act, the Draft Royal Decree classifies AI systems based on the level of risk as follows and differentiates the regulatory approach for each one:\n\n1. Prohibited AI\n\nAccording to the Draft Royal Decree, 'Prohibited AI' refers to AI systems involving activities intended to influence or change human behavior, which may lead to physical or mental harm, or result in unfair, disproportionate actions that are not commensurate with the context of those activities. The Draft Royal Decree also provides specific use cases of Prohibited AI in its annex as detailed below:\n\nProhibited AI is strictly prohibited from integration into any services or markets, albeit with certain exemptions. These exemptions may include instances where the use of Prohibited AI aligns with the laws of certain regulatory bodies, or upon obtaining permission from the relevant authority on a case-by-case basis, provided such Prohibited AI is subject to the same measures as High-Risk AI as described below.\n\n2. High-Risk AI\n\nHigh-Risk AI refers to AI systems that are highly regulated under the Draft Royal Decree (see more in 1.2Important Obligations for High-Risk AI). The Draft Royal Decree elaborates on cases where the use of AI systems is considered high-risk as follows:\n\n3. Limited-Risk AI\n\nThe term 'Limited-Risk AI' is not explicitly defined in the Draft Royal Decree. However, the provision that specifies the transparency obligations in providing or deploying certain AI systems implies a strategy for coping with AI systems with a limited risk level. This provision is, therefore, classified as a regulatory approach to Limited-Risk AI systems.\n\nAI systems deemed Limited Risk AI are those intended to interact directly with natural persons, such as chatbots, emotion recognition or biometric categorization systems, or AI-generated content (e.g., deep fakes). These AI systems are subject to minimal transparency obligations where the providers or deployers must ensure that users realize or are well informed that they are interacting with such AI systems.\n\nRemarks: Beyond these certain AI systems, the EU AI Act also contains a provision regarding the obligations specifically for providers of general-purpose AI (\"GPAI\") models, and more obligations for those providing GPAI models deemed to involve systematic risk. However, such specific provisions were not incorporated in the current Draft Royal Decree.\n\nThe Draft Royal Decree stipulates that the providers of High-risk AI systems must comply with or put in place the requirements below:\n\nWhile the EU AI Act comprehensively explains the criteria and details of the aforementioned requirements, the Draft Royal Decree specifies that such details will be further described in sub-regulations.\n\n2. Registration\n\nThe Draft Royal Decree mandates that providers of High-Risk AI must register themselves and their AI systems with the responsible authority before placing them on the market or putting them into service. Similarly to personal data protection law and digital platform law, this requirement extends to those providers located outside Thailand. If offering services to end-users in Thailand, such providers must appoint an authorized representative to fulfill this registration requirement on their behalf.\n\n3. Appointment of Representative\n\nThe Draft Royal Decree stipulates obligations for providers of High-Risk AI established outside of Thailand but providing services to users in Thailand to appoint, in writing, an authorized representative established in Thailand. This representative is responsible for performing and carrying out obligations and procedures set forth in the Draft Royal Decree on their behalf, including acting as the contact person with the responsible authority.\n\nIn addition, the Draft Royal Decree states that such an authorized representative must not be a business operator under foreign business operation laws.\n\n1.3 Penalties\n\nThe Draft Royal Decree stipulates the following penalties:\n\n2. Draft Act on Thailand Artificial Intelligence Promotion and Support\n\nApart from the regulatory aspect under the Draft Royal Decree by the ONDE, the Electronic Transactions Development Agency (\"ETDA\") also invited public feedback in July 2023 on the Draft Act on Promotion and Support for Artificial Intelligence in Thailand (\"Draft Act\") along with two draft sub-regulations, i.e., (i) the draft ETDA Notification on Risk Assessment from the Use of AI Systems and (ii) the draft ETDA Notification on AI Sandbox.\n\nThese draft laws aim to enhance the development of AI by providing an AI regulatory sandbox, relaxation of or exemption from certain laws, and support from relevant authorities. It remains to be seen how the Draft Act will evolve in the light of the rapid progress in AI development.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nCurrently, these draft laws and regulations, which have been through public hearings, are being further considered and developed by the responsible authorities. However, Thailand is also monitoring the development of AI regulations in other countries in the region to see if there are any regulations that would be suitable to serve as references for Thailand's legislative approach.\n\nOnce enacted, these draft laws and regulations, especially the Draft Royal Decree, will affect many players, such as providers, deployers, importers, and distributors of AI systems. They will force these players to prepare and be ready for compliance, for example by assessing risks, and registering and monitoring the use of AI systems, among other requirements.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decree", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Decree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETA_(separatist_group)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ETA (separatist group)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emotion recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_behavior", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human behavior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biometrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sandbox game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Exploited humans", "body": "A terminally ill German man partnered with AI-powered legacy platform Eternos to create a \"a comprehensive, interactive AI version\" of his voice.\n\nToday we are in the middle of a hype cycle in which companies are racing to integrate artificial intelligence tools into products, transforming fields including logistics, manufacturing and healthcare.\n\nThe global AI market was worth approximately $200 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow more than 20% each year to nearly $2 trillion by 2030. There are no exact numbers of how many workers participate globally in the industry, but the figure is in the millions. And if trends continue at their current rate, their number will expand dramatically.\n\nWhen we use AI products, we are inserting ourselves into the lives of these workers. Many tech companies present a vision of their products as shining, autonomous machines -- computers teaching themselves as they go from huge quantities of data -- rather than the reality of the labor that trains them and is managed by them.\n\nThe illusion of autonomous AI has historical roots. In the late 18th century, a supposedly automated chess-playing machine, the \"Mechanical Turk,\" was developed to impress the empress of Austria. The inventor of the machine, Wolfgang von Kempelen, claimed it could play chess automatically of its own accord, but hidden inside the box was a human chess master who operated it through a series of levers and mirrors.\n\nToday's AI benefits from a similar illusion. Sophisticated software functions only through thousands of hours of low-paid, menial labor -- workers forced to work like robots in the hopes that AI will become more like a human. Amazon even coined the term \"artificial artificial intelligence\" to describe this process of keeping human labor integrated into seemingly automated processes.\n\nFrom a labor perspective, AI is really an \"extraction machine.\" Beneath the polished exterior of our devices lies the complex network of components and relationships necessary to power it. When AI breaks down or does not function properly, human workers are there to step in and assist algorithms in completing the work. When Siri does not recognize a voice command or when facial recognition software fails to verify a person's identity, these cases are often sent to human workers to establish what went wrong and how the algorithm could be improved.\n\nInterviewing workers from Kenya, Uganda, Ireland, Iceland, the United Kingdom and the U.S., we found that the rise of AI is being powered by data annotators, content moderators, machine learning engineers, data center technicians, writers and artists.\n\nIn Kenya and Uganda, we spoke to dozens of data annotators working 10-hour days for less than $2 an hour performing repetitive, mind-numbing tasks with no opportunities for career progression. In Ireland, a prominent voice actor recounted discovering a synthesized version of her own voice produced without her knowledge using AI tools. In Iceland, we visited data center workers who documented the energy-intensive nature of these centers, which consume more electricity than Icelandic households combined.\n\nAnd facilitating AI systems is not the only way the technology extracts from workers. When AI is put into action, particularly in the workplace, it is often through management systems that centralize knowledge of the labor process and reduce the level of skill required to do a job by routinizing and simplifying it.\n\nSuch systems extract more effort from workers by forcing them to work harder and faster for their employers' benefit. In the United Kingdom, we interviewed warehouse workers whose working lives were governed by a complex series of AI systems that reduced them to human automatons. For many of us, this will be how we are most exposed to the damage caused by the extraction machine. We might not become content moderators anytime soon, but the same machine that entraps data annotators affects other jobs too.\n\nThe widespread adoption of current AI tools may feel inevitable. But that doesn't have to preclude a fairer and more just future of work. Four principles should drive the expansion of AI.\n\nFirst, we need to build and connect organizations devoted to exercising the collective power of workers. This entails not only institutionalizing local unions and worker associations, but also fostering a truly transnational workers' struggle with campaigns and organizations that cross national boundaries and connect the struggles of blue- and white-collar workers throughout the global production networks of AI.\n\nSecond, because AI is often embedded in consumer goods and services, there are important openings for civil society and social movements to exert pressure on companies to guarantee minimum standards of pay and conditions for all workers throughout the supply chain.\n\nThird, because some companies will be able to inoculate themselves against consumer pressure, governments should establish regulations to mandate minimum working standards for all workers. The risk for governments in regulating companies that profit from outsourced jobs is that work can quickly flow away to other companies and corners of the planet. Thus we need global agreements that set minimum standards, such as an International Labor Organization convention, which covers and updates fundamental principles and rights at work. We also need to examine the potentials of regulation such as the European Union's supply chain directive, which will mandate that large companies impose ethical and environmental standards across supply chains.\n\nFourth, there is a need for more expansive worker-led interventions not just to build collective power, but also to explore meaningful ways of implementing workplace democracy. Those could include cooperatives where workers collectively own and manage an organization, or company boards with half the seats reserved for workers of the company who share equal governance power on the board.\n\nShould these four attempts at \"rewiring the machine\" be successfully put into practice, global capitalism might still stand in the way of improving the lives of AI's global workforce. Faced with restrictions of the kind listed above, capitalists in the past have threatened to withdraw investment unless they can negotiate more favorable conditions. But this shouldn't stop us working together to defend workers' rights against the latest generation of venture capital-funded tech titans.\n\n-- James Muldoon is an associate professor in management at the University of Essex.

The survey found that \"nearly 6 in 10 COOs (58%) say their firms use GenAI for accessing information, while half of the executives say they use it with chatbots for customer service.\"\n\nThis focus on less complex applications extends to other areas as well. The report noted that 53% of COOs use AI technology to create data visualizations. However, the effectiveness of these applications varies, with 22% of respondents indicating that GenAI was not highly effective for this purpose.\n\nThe tendency to prioritize mundane tasks over more strategic applications is particularly evident in certain key business areas. \"COOs are less likely to credit GenAI as necessary for production purposes, such as managing inventory or running logistics,\" the report states. \"Just 35% of COOs say GenAI is highly important for HR management and logistics.\"\n\nThis cautious approach to AI implementation may stem from a need for greater familiarity with the technology's full capabilities. The survey revealed that 38% of COOs consider familiarizing themselves with the complete range of AI possibilities a drawback to implementation.\n\nWhile many firms are playing it safe with their AI deployments, the report suggests that this conservative approach may limit their potential returns on investment. The report finds a clear correlation between strategic AI use and positive financial outcomes.\n\nThe report showed that \"29% of the firms using the technology in highly impactful and strategic ways report very positive ROI.\" However, in contrast, \"just 8.8% of firms using GenAI for more routine and less impactful tasks reported positive ROI.\"\n\nThis disparity in outcomes highlights the potential benefits of more ambitious AI strategies. Companies willing to trust AI with more complex and consequential tasks reap greater rewards.\n\nOne example of this disconnect between potential and actual use is in code generation. The report classifies this as a \"medium impact\" strategic use of AI, noting, \"Although using the technology for code generation was highly effective according to all those who used it, just 18% of COOs reported generating code with GenAI.\"\n\nBeyond its impact on business processes and financial outcomes, the adoption of AI also significantly affects workforce composition and skills requirements. Contrary to fears of widespread job losses due to automation, the survey suggests that AI is driving a shift in labor needs rather than simply eliminating positions.\n\nThe report found that \"88% reported that their organization's need for analytically skilled workers has increased.\" This surge in demand for analytical talent comes even as \"42% of COOs agree that using GenAI has decreased the company's need for lower-skilled workers.\"\n\nThis shift in workforce requirements presents challenges and opportunities for companies and employees. Firms may need to invest heavily in retraining and upskilling programs to ensure their workforce can effectively leverage AI technologies. Meanwhile, workers with strong analytical skills may be in increasingly high demand.\n\nThe focus on analytical skills aligns with the broader trend of data-driven decision-making in modern business. As AI systems generate more insights and predictions, companies need employees to interpret this information and translate it into actionable strategies.\n\nDespite the challenges in implementation, COOs remain optimistic about AI's potential to drive efficiencies and reduce costs. The report showed that executives primarily focus on efficiency-related metrics when assessing their AI investments.\n\n\"Nearly all COOs surveyed, 92%, report using at least one measure of investment return that focuses on cost reduction, such as reduced operational costs, capital expenditures or headcount,\" the report stated. This emphasis on cost-cutting metrics outweighs increased profits or market expansion measures, with only 70% of COOs citing profit-related measures of AI success.\n\nThis focus on efficiency gains may explain the current preference for using AI in more routine tasks, where the impact on costs is more immediately apparent and easier to quantify.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs companies continue to navigate the AI landscape, those who can effectively leverage the technology for strategic purposes may gain a significant competitive advantage. However, realizing this potential will require overcoming implementation hurdles, rethinking traditional approaches to workforce management, and taking calculated risks with more ambitious AI deployments.\n\nThe report concluded, \"The opportunity is ripe for larger firms to focus their AI use in highly impactful ways and employ more analytically skilled workers to fill the gaps they are currently experiencing.\"", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Product development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motivation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strategic planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Correlation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resource_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human resource management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Media (communication)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business process"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Compensation_and_Benefits", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Compensation and Benefits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AI-in-Big-tech.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

He is principal investigator at the Cardiovascular Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He talked about his AI work with American Heart Association News as part of \"The Experts Say,\" a series in which specialists explain how they apply what they've learned to their own lives. The following interview has been edited.\n\nHow is AI being used in the field of cardiology?\n\nWe know that AI is used in every aspect of cardiology, including in the diagnosis, classification and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. I chaired the writing committee for an American Heart Association scientific statement earlier this year where we addressed the main areas in which it is applied. Some examples of how it's used include interpreting cardiac imaging and matching genetic variants to health-related traits to better understand genetic risks for disease.\n\nWe know that AI has even exceeded the performance of medical experts in some cases when interpreting cardiac imaging. It can detect subtle, non-visually detected signatures in data to make a more accurate diagnosis.\n\nHow do you use AI in your work at Massachusetts General Hospital?\n\nMy focus is to try to improve in-hospital and out-of-hospital patient monitoring.\n\nRegarding in-hospital monitoring, we want to integrate all patient-related information available in order to make the best possible decisions with these patients. That means being able to predict and prevent adverse events.\n\nWe also aim to use AI to help determine the optimal time to discharge a patient. We don't want to keep patients longer than they should be staying or discharge them faster than they should. AI can help make those decisions. It will integrate information obtained from different sources that is dynamically changing during a patient's hospital stay, such as electrocardiograms, blood pressure and electronic health records.\n\nSince we can't have a doctor next to the patient all the time, AI can collect all this data and integrate it, see if certain parameters are being exceeded. Then it can make a recommendation, perhaps that patient X should stay one extra day.\n\nWith respect to out-of-hospital monitoring, we know many, many people use wearable devices such as smartwatches that collect data, such as whether someone is having an irregular heart rhythm. Many devices are not medical grade, so we can't fully trust these data yet, but we're heading toward better technologies.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWe want to use the data these devices collect to make decisions about when a patient should be coming to the hospital. We don't want to bring someone to the hospital for a checkup without a reason, but we also don't want to bring them too late when their condition has worsened. AI can help us make better decisions about when they should come in, which could not only improve care but also reduce costs, which is another significant benefit.\n\nHow does AI account for non-measurable data, such as how a person feels?\n\nWe do need to recognize and integrate how the patient is feeling - their symptoms - into this process. We need more than a person's vital signs and how those may be fluctuating.\n\nBut there are apps that can record this by asking questions. How do you feel during or after exercise? How is your mental state? Do you have an appetite? It can be a questionnaire and the person can log into the app every day to report how they are feeling. All these states of being can be integrated with the other data we collect.\n\nDo you use AI outside of work?\n\nAI has entered every aspect of our lives, whether we know it or not.\n\nIt is used in navigation systems in the car to help us assess traffic and choose the optimal route to get somewhere. It is used to determine whether an email is spam. It is used in social media to direct our interests to certain topics. We may not pay attention to it or understand how it's being used, but it has entered our lives to stay.\n\nThe foundational principles behind AI are not new. They have been taught for many years back, but they were not called AI or machine learning. The AI research and development today is enabled by an explosion in the volume of data we collect, as well as the vastly increased computational power that is available to process these data.\n\nWhen a new technology appears, I may not use it directly in my work, but I will experiment with it. For example, I'm taking a paper I've written and I want to see how well a new application of AI can understand it, whether it can generate an accurate summary of what I wrote.\n\nI've also had discussions with my son, Alkinoos, who is a 22-year-old, second-year medical student, about a project he's doing to compare a physician's opinion in making a diagnosis to how well AI could make a correct diagnosis using the patient's symptoms, physical exam and diagnostic and lab tests. Even more importantly, he wants to know whether AI could guide the process of decision-making for a physician. Could AI help improve the prognosis or management of a case?\n\nHow might AI be used in medicine in the future?\n\nThe future is the integration of all this data. We want to take all these disparate aspects of clinical knowledge, genomics, data taken from wearable devices and electronic health records and our medical history and integrate it into systems that can make optimal predictions about a person's health.\n\nI'm fascinated by the integration of data for multi-organ systems research - that is, how medicine is starting to be addressed holistically, not focusing on a single organ problem but rather the body as a whole. For example, how a person's mental state is linked to cardiovascular disease.\n\nEach one of us is different and we need that personalized care to improve outcomes. This is the hope of AI in medicine, the transition one day to providing equitable care and improving outcomes on an individualized basis.\n\nAmerican Heart Association News\n\ncovers heart and brain health.

The development and training of large AI models require substantial computing power, often beyond the reach of individual universities, particularly because of the prohibitive costs of developing models from scratch and bringing them up to the level of computing sophistication that could be meaningful for the industry. Consider, for example, that training OpenAI's biggest models cost \"much more than\" $50 million to $100 million last year.\n\nAmerican universities, usually known for an incessant and irreverent competition for upstaging one another are now pooling resources to ensure that they do not get left behind in the research and innovation curve in the AI age. Moreover, their concern is that they do not want to be rendered irrelevant for the industry and lose their quintessential role in providing the talent pipeline for the tech firms at the forefront of AI innovation. The state of New York, as an example, has taken the lead to collaborate with seven universities including Cornell University, Columbia University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute among others to set up a consortium of public-private fund called \"Empire AI\".\n\nThis $400 million fund is focused on promoting responsible and cutting edge AI research in universities across the state. In the past three decades, the Indian economy has surged to a large extent on the back of its computing talent with companies like Infosys and TCS making their place in the global tech supply chains. It is no news that Indian tech talent is considered an essential element in the magic mix of large and growing tech firms. However, it is also a fact that in recent times even the best of technology schools, such as the IITs have found it hard to place their students with the industry.\n\nPart of it is indeed due to poor market conditions. Yet, part of it is because of a mismatch in the level of skills that the top league of the industry players are demanding and what computer science institutes are able to produce. This to be clear is no deficiency on part of the schools or the students. It is simply a challenge of a lack of funding. Despite poor market conditions, globally AI startups have been defying trends and raking up billions of dollars in funding. According to data from Crunchbase, investments in artificial intelligence (AI) startups surged to $24 billion from April to June, more than doubling compared to the previous quarter. The need for a talent pool that can lead these AI startups and existing tech behemoths exists and will grow despite market fluctuations in other fields.\n\nTo capitalize on this, India would need to bring in public and private funds to keep our computer science departments well-funded and at the cutting edge of AI innovation. It would not be an exaggeration to say that this is a national priority because much of our economy does depend and will depend on the competitiveness of our tech talent. To be fair, the India AI Mission seems to do exactly that. It is a publicprivate partnership, approved by the cabinet in March 2024, with a planned US $1.25 billion investment outlay to expand India's computing infrastructure and establish an accessible data repository. It also comes with an India AI Innovation Centre (IAIC) - an academic centre that envisions to \"retain\" research talent in AI.\n\nHowever, the IITs and NITs seem to be left out of the picture in the grand scheme of things associated with the India AI Mission. If the interim budget of February 2024 is any indicator then the overall spend on IITs is on the decline. In the February budget the government allocated Rs 10,324 crore on IITs and Rs 212 crore on IIMs, a reduction of Rs 60 crore and Rs 119 crore respectively, compared with FY24's revised estimates. These allocations were not only an absolute decline but they also shrank in proportion to the overall budget. The new budget for the financial year due to be presented on July 23 has an opportunity to save India's tech talent and its long term economic backbone.\n\n(The writer is Research Manager to Dr. Kaushik Basu, Department of Economics, Cornell University, and CEO, Insights International.)", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rensselaer_Polytechnic_Institute", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosys", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infosys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Consultancy_Services", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tata Consultancy Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Institutes of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consortium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2a253c1258143da0dbcb615b6a8e21da.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 4508, "textEnd": 4515}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

But for all the hype, the technology has so far had \"almost no\" discernible impact on business practices or productivity. There are signs of a \"backlash\" to the AI boom, says Neil Shearing of Capital Economics.\n\nRecent investment analysts' notes have highlighted \"the technology's shortcomings\". Such a period of disillusionment was inevitable. New technologies always see a lag between introduction and wider economic effects. IT developed in the 1980s and early 1990s didn't raise US productivity until the late 1990s.\n\n\"The boost to productivity from AI will be substantial\", but it could be a few years yet before that feeds through to corporate earnings and GDP. Just as during the \"railway mania\" of the 1840s, \"investors are attempting to capture the benefits of new technologies ahead of them fully materialising in the real economy\".\n\nAt the peak of 19th-century railway mania, investors were pouring the equivalent of \"around 7% of Britain's national income\" into rail projects, says Edward Chancellor on Breakingviews.\n\nAs today, there was much grand talk of technology advancing \"human civilisation\". Overcapacity and resulting losses were \"large and largely foreseeable\". There were, for example, \"three separate lines connecting Liverpool with Leeds\". The boom ended with a financial crisis in 1847. Yet the parallel between AI and rail is not perfect. By the 1840s steam locomotives were a fairly mature technology.\n\nBy contrast, the \"hype over self-teaching computers\" appears much more exaggerated. \"Daron Acemoglu of MIT argues that AI buzz 'obscures the reality of what is really a quite limited technology',\" says Andrew Orlowski in The Telegraph. By his estimate, \"just 4.6% of tasks can be reliably automated\". That makes AI more comparable to an Excel spreadsheet than the harbinger of a \"fourth industrial revolution\".\n\nAI uses pattern recognition to guess the right response to a query, but an \"intrinsic feature\" of such machines is that they confidently \"make stuff up\" when they can't find a reliable answer (a problem known as \"hallucination\"). This renders AI \"useless for many potential use cases\". Previous technology bubbles left us with Victorian railways and internet fibre infrastructure.\n\nBut today's tech firms are \"spending $1 trillion on data centres\" that will soon become outdated as new chips hit the market. \"This is capital incineration on a vast scale.\" Financial \"bubbles can take a long time to burst\", so there is reason to stay invested for now in the beneficiaries of the AI spending splurge: the \"chip manufacturers, utilities and other companies exposed to the coming buildout of the power grid\", says Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs.\n\nAI is hardly the first Silicon Valley \"tech hype cycle. Virtual reality, the metaverse and blockchain\" also attracted huge investments, but still have few real-world applications. Covello thinks that \"if important-use cases\" for AI \"don't start to become more apparent in the next 12-18 months\", then investors' enthusiasm \"may begin to fade\".", "source": {"uri":

It's a natural marriage, since AI has the potential to significantly improve what observability does. The question is how to make the best use of AI to support observability in discovering an organization's unknowns, providing actionable insights, and performing remediations.\n\nObservability combines monitoring, visibility, and automation to determine the state of a system. It then quickly delivers actionable insights on remediating issues. That process would take countless hours if done manually. AI adds an adaptive intelligence layer that provides end-to-end automation and actionable insights in real time to improve decision-making.\n\nA unified observability platform makes use of AI via AIOps, which applies AI and machine learning (ML) models to collect data from throughout the enterprise - from logs and alerts to applications, containers, and clouds. It performs tasks ranging from root cause analysis and incident prevention to advanced correlation. And although AI has already proved valuable, its impact is about to become considerably more pronounced, fueling observability in the near- and long-term future.\n\nThe quest toward automated remediation is underway, but there is the potential with AIOps to do much more.\n\nOne example would be with a digital experience management platform. Currently, platforms like this have a variety of remediation scripts based on expert input that service desk agents use to either perform one-click remediations or to recommend self-service options to users. The next step is having AI begin to model decision-making like an expert would.\n\nVia constant monitoring, an AI could ingest incoming data and detect an anomaly or some other activity that exceeds preset thresholds. It could then perform a series of actions, similar to what happens with remediation scripts, to resolve the problem.\n\nJust as importantly, if the AI model doesn't resolve the problem, it would automatically open a ticket with the platform used for managing issues. It will give the service desk everything they need to proceed, including the location of the issue (application, device, and network), relevant insights the model has derived, and the level of priority the issue demands. That information will enable a service desk agent to resolve the problem quickly.\n\nBecause of all those capabilities, AI automation can deliver both remediation and actionable insights to users.\n\nOrganizations and IT teams that want to take advantage of AIOps should start preparing now. Here are a few important steps.\n\nAssess the current state of the enterprise. Take a look at the monitoring and observability tools you have in place, and get a clear understanding of where your data sources are. You also need to understand your goals and objectives. What are the primary drivers for using AIOps? Is it about improving system performance? Predicting failures? Reducing downtime?\n\nLook for a full-fidelity observability platform. AI and ML models need data to work well. And part of assessing your environment is identifying the visibility gaps in your organization. A unified observability platform can provide visibility into the entire enterprise and how everything within it is connected.\n\nUnderstand the types of observability data these platforms collect. A unified platform ingests data from the full stack, including users, applications, infrastructure, network, cloud and so on. Other platforms may integrate with third parties. It's also helpful to understand the techniques the platforms use for AI/ML. Different platforms may have different benefits.\n\nBe more proactive than reactive with AI. Organizations may want to prioritize the transition to AIOps, perhaps starting with mission-critical applications where they could deploy an AI model, instead of runbooks, to generate intelligent tickets. IT teams also could identify recurring problems that are taking up a lot of operational cycles to see where using AI could significantly reduce the man hours spent on repetitive or recurring tasks. Applying intelligent automation or anomaly detection could identify emerging problems at a very early stage and address them proactively, rather than wasting operational cycles on being reactive.\n\nIf you're looking at platforms to see if they offer full-fidelity data, you should check to be sure that it's a converged platform with strong visualization that is capable of intelligent automation or AI-driven capabilities. That's where a platform's actionable insights come from.\n\nAnd keep in mind the importance of those insights. AIOps is about more than allowing an AI model to resolve issues. Ensuring that it generates comprehensive ServiceNow tickets is extremely critical to the process. AI is very powerful, but it isn't infallible; the more complex the systems and processes, the more likely it is that AI can make a mistake. You don't want to have black-box AIOps. You need to see those insights and understand as much as possible what an AI model's decision is based on.\n\nThere's going to be a greater expansion of AIOps capabilities, and more vendors will expand their use of AI in their observability offering.\n\nA likely next step will be applying more specialized knowledge, with AI models running automations, including decision workflow automations, based on information generated for service tickets. This would give service desk agents more precise information to work with.\n\nOther innovations are around the corner - whatever takes shape, AIOps is going to become increasingly important to organizations, and AI will be driving those new developments.", "source": {"uri": "dataversity.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "DATAVERSITY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence_for_IT_Operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Observability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_service_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IT service management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Correlation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Root cause analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_visualization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scientific visualization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anomaly detection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solution stack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://d3an9kf42ylj3p.cloudfront.net/uploads/2022/07/Mike-Marks_600x448.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Seems almost obvious and akin to saying that the sky is blue and that the birds are singing outside.\n\nI have a twist or different angle to ask you about. Please prepare yourself accordingly.\n\nIf modern-day generative AI such as the widely and wildly popular ChatGPT seemingly reads a sentence and responds fluently, does that mean or at least strongly imply that generative AI or ChatGPT is conscious and exhibiting consciousness?\n\nWell, a recently published research study surveyed a sampling of Americans and found that two-thirds appear to believe that generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, does seem to have or showcase some form of consciousness. The thing is, by and large, AI scientists and AI researchers would pretty much argue contrarily that current generative AI is in fact not conscious (side note, famously in 2022, you might recall that a Google engineer proclaimed AI was conscious, stirring quite a controversy, and was roundly debunked for such claims, see my coverage at the link here).\n\nThe idea that the public at large believes generative AI is conscious would suggest that perhaps the everyday person is anthropomorphizing AI, namely attributing human qualities to AI and overstating or over-believing what AI can do. This is troubling since the gap between what people think AI is or can do has the potential for utilizing and relying upon AI in unsettling and possibly endangering ways. All manner of AI ethics and AI law facets arise accordingly.\n\nIn the parlance of these matters, it is said that folk psychology comes into the picture. The deal is this. People tend to view the world via a kind of commonsense framework of how mental states work. And, since generative AI has the appearance of being similar to human cognition, they naturally tend to apply human precepts to AI. This is reminiscent or illustrative of a phenomenon labeled as folk or layman psychology, a topic I've covered previously, such as this discussion on how people formulate a theory of mind (ToM) associated with what they think that other people are thinking about, including nowadays what they think AI is \"thinking about\", see the link here.\n\nLet's unpack the whole kit and kaboodle on this.\n\nBefore we leap into the details, allow me to go into my customary opening remarks.\n\nFor my ongoing readers, in today's column, I am continuing my in-depth series about the impact of generative AI in the health and medical realm. The focus this time is once again on the mental health domain and examines how people perceive generative AI. There are decidedly mental health ramifications associated with the way we associate human cognition with AI.\n\nI have previously examined numerous interleaving facets of generative AI and mental health, see my comprehensive overview at the link here. You might also find of notable interest a CBS 60 Minutes episode that recently examined crucial facets of this evolving topic, see the link here (I am honored and pleased to indicate that I was featured in the episode, see the link here).\n\nOther vital background includes my in-depth coverage of mental health chatbots which have been bolstered by generative AI (see the link here) and the rapidly changing nature of the client-therapist relationship due to generative AI at the link here. I explored where things are headed regarding the levels of AI-based mental therapy autonomous guidance at the link here, and showcased the importance of the World Health Organization (WHO) report on global health and generative AI at the link here, and so on.\n\nBeing Mindful About Interpreting What We Believe\n\nI will be walking you through the nitty-gritty details of a recently published research study that suggests people at large construe ChatGPT and generative AI as being conscious. The mainstream media headlines covering the study tended to subtly overstate what the study actually found. Here are some hard-to-detect misleadingly worded headlines that I'd like you to closely examine:\n\nIt has to do with properly interpreting statistics and research study results.\n\nAs you will soon see, the study provided respondents with a sliding scale of 1 to 100 to rate whether they believed that ChatGPT is conscious, thus allowing a range for each given marked response (a bottom score or 1 is that ChatGPT isn't conscious, while a top score of 100 is that it absolutely is so). The researchers opted to indicate that out of 300 respondents who took the survey, 100 had provided a score of 1, while all the rest, or the remaining 200, gave a score higher than 1.\n\nIf you lump together all the scores above 1, meaning from a score of 2 to 100, they indeed account for two-thirds of the responses. Based on that two-thirds count, you could presumably declare that a majority or most people believed ChatGPT is conscious. But we need to be mindful of interpreting statistics, such as in this case the implication is not that two-thirds unequivocally voted that ChatGPT is conscious, but that two-thirds responded to varying degrees about the perceived consciousness.\n\nFor example, those respondents who indicated a score of 2 would hardly seem to be outright declaring that ChatGPT is conscious (I looked at the raw data, nicely provided as open source via the researchers, and noted that 7 respondents, or about 2% indicated a score of 2). A score of 1 versus a score of 2, on a scale up to 100, doesn't seem like much of a leap above the bottom score saying that ChatGPT is not conscious. Did these respondents simply falter in moving the sliding bar down to the very bottom, or did they intend to be just a teensy tiny higher than the bottom to suggest that there was some minuscule iota of consciousness? Maybe they were hedging their bet, as it were. Similar questions can be asked about the raw scores of 3, 4, 5, and others toward the bottom portion of the bar.\n\nDo you see how lumping together all the scores above 1 is a bit off-putting when it comes to aptly portraying the results and that headlines proffering a kind of absolutism have perhaps gone a bridge too far? The headlines could have said something like \"Most people think that ChatGPT might have some level of consciousness\" versus unequivocally stating that \"Most people say that ChatGPT is conscious\". To me, it seems that a majority or most believed that some degree of level of consciousness existed, but not in any ironclad way. In other words, people were leaning into the possibility of consciousness rather than putting their foot resolutely down that there is consciousness.\n\nI will come back to this idea of variability versus absoluteness.\n\nThere is something else that we need to nail down regarding the topic of consciousness.\n\nLet's see what that is.\n\nDefining Consciousness Is A Longstanding Challenge\n\nWhat does it mean to say that someone or perhaps something is conscious?\n\nRecall that I started this discussion by asking you whether you are conscious, and I used the fact that you were reading the words as a potential indicator that you are conscious. Does that make sense? Or is that a flimsy test of sorts? A heated debate ensues.\n\nWe must define our terms.\n\nHere's what several commonplace dictionary definitions say about being conscious:\n\nBelieve it or not, the question of what consciousness is and how it arises has been an enduring mystery dating back to the earliest days of humankind. Great philosophers such as Socrates and Aristotle debated the thorny matter. In the modern era, we are still mired in an inconclusive debate, despite advances in psychology, neuroscience, and akin disciplines.\n\nConsciousness remains one of the most vexing conundrums.\n\nI'd like to cover some overall theories about consciousness and then we'll be prepared to consider how AI might or might not be ascribed to the consciousness moniker. As a heads-up, and in case you get interested in digging further into the topic of consciousness, there are plenty of theories of consciousness (known generally as ToC), enough that they seem to pop up like wildflowers. No single ToC has won in the ever-going weaning process of finding the must-be grandiose all-encompassing and agreed-to theory of how consciousness arises.\n\nA good place to start would be this article entitled \"Theories Of Consciousness\" by Anil Seth and Tim Bayne, Nature Reviews Neuroscience, July 2022, which offered these crucial points (excerpts):\n\nOne thought is that sometimes we get ourselves into a circular unending motion on the matter of consciousness that doesn't get us very far. For example, you might say that consciousness is the act of being conscious. Meanwhile, being conscious is said to showcase consciousness. Do you see how that is nearly gibberish? We are going in a circle of defining something by using the same words to define the matter being defined. The researchers above rightfully noted that we need to have non-circular definitions or else we will be like the proverbial dog that constantly chases its own tail.\n\nThe researchers further provide an intriguing idea that perhaps consciousness consists of global states of awareness and local states of awareness. I bring this up to highlight that though this seems compelling, not everyone would agree with the proffered notion. Once again, this is a theory about consciousness and there is plenty of room to argue for and against whatever stipulations a particular theory contains. Maybe global and local is fine, perhaps it is off base. Reasoned arguments can be made either way.\n\nThey also make a vital point about the testing of any theory of consciousness. Simply stated, you want to have a test that can determine whether consciousness is present, plus, you also want the test to ascertain when consciousness is absent. Some liken this to an on/off switch in a room. What is the test to determine when the light is on (which, in this use case, is when consciousness is present)? And what is the test to determine when the light is off (i.e., no consciousness)?\n\nThere is even controversy over that seemingly straight-ahead consideration. Here's why. Some assert that consciousness is not a binary on/off. They would insist that if you only view consciousness as a sharp dichotomy, you are missing the boat, perhaps entirely. The claim is that consciousness is a range or spectrum that includes varying amounts of being conscious.\n\nTalking about consciousness can be dizzying due to all the ins and outs involved.\n\nLet's explore another and more recently published paper on consciousness theories, a study entitled \"Tests For Consciousness In Humans And Beyond\" by Tim Bayne, Anil K. Seth, Marcello Massimini, Joshua Shepherd, Axel Cleeremans, Stephen Fleming, Rafael Malach, Jason Mattingley, David Menon, Adrian Owen, Megan Peters, Adeel Razi, and Liad Mudrik, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, May 2024. Here are some key points (excerpts):\n\nHere's an attention-getter. When is it that consciousness presumably first arises, such as before actual birth and while in the womb? That's a doozy of a tough question.\n\nAnother open issue is whether you can be said to be conscious when you are asleep. Some would fervently argue that you aren't conscious while sleeping and instead, you are in a dormant or sleeping state. Others would counterargue that your mind is still active, including not only dreaming but instantly ready to respond to stimuli such as your alarm clock going off or stoked by an earthquake shaking your bed. Thus, you are conscious while also sleeping.\n\nMy interest here is whether anything other than humans possesses consciousness.\n\nWe shall start with a seemingly easy instance. Do animals have consciousness? Good question. You are possibly looking over at your pet dog or cat, and imploringly asking your beloved animal whether it is conscious. The dog might wag its tail. The cat might yawn. Was this all part of their exhibiting their consciousness?\n\nThe concern that comes up on these pressing matters is that we might render a verdict about the presence of consciousness that is wrong. For example, a false positive would be the act of declaring that consciousness exists when it does not. I pick up a rock and tell you that the rock is conscious. Am I right or wrong? The immediate reaction by most is that a rock is clearly not conscious. Others might say otherwise, vehemently claiming that everything has some semblance of consciousness, regardless of whether your preferred test shows it or not. Perhaps a rock has a form of consciousness that we just haven't divined as yet.\n\nOn the other side of that coin is the false negative, whereby we say there is no consciousness, but it does exist. Suppose for example a person is in a coma. They seem utterly unresponsive. They aren't reading, they aren't writing, they aren't talking, they aren't listening (though you might have a difficult time asserting that), etc. Is the person conscious? We might declare they are not. Well, we might be wrong, and the person could be thinking about Einstein's theory of relativity, and we don't realize that's what is happening inside their head.\n\nQuestions, questions, questions.\n\nWe might as well add more questions to the pile of questions. It is time to think about AI.\n\nAI And The Consciousness Contentions\n\nUsing just about any of the major generative AI apps will indubitably stir people into wondering whether AI has reached consciousness. You type a prompt into generative AI and the AI responds in a fluent manner. You go back and forth, carrying on a lengthy and engaging conversation with the generative AI. By gosh, this does smack of the AI having consciousness.\n\nHold on. Been there, done that. You see, there was a popular AI program in the 1960s and 1970s known as Eliza that appeared to interact with people and render mental health advice, see my detailed coverage at the link here. Eliza consisted of some relatively simple programming tricks. The AI developer was shocked to observe that people thought the program was conscious.\n\nModern-day generative AI is much more complex and far beyond the simplistic trickery of Eliza. But does it reach the vaunted ranks of consciousness? That is the zillion-dollar question.\n\nWhen I give presentations about the latest in AI, some attendees will ask me whether it matters that AI has or doesn't have consciousness. It seems like not a big deal. I notably point out that societal ethics and laws are shaped around consciousness considerations. For example, we tend to ethically and legally assert that suffering can occur for that which has or consists of consciousness, while that which is not conscious cannot similarly suffer. A rock when tossed onto the ground doesn't get hurt or have its emotions upset. Why do we say this? Because we declare and claim that a rock does not embody consciousness.\n\nPonder the same issue about AI.\n\nIf AI does have consciousness, we would seem to be ethically and legally obligated to ensure that AI is treated accordingly. I have covered extensively the ongoing efforts to put into law that AI should have legal personhood, see the link here. This would establish that AI has rights. Those rights might be one-for-one the same as human rights. Those rights might be more so on par with whatever we consider to be animal rights. Those rights might be something else, neither human rights nor animal rights. An AI set of rights might specifically be formulated, see my discussion at the link here.\n\nAre you crazy, some exhort.\n\nYou cannot go ahead and hand over rights to AI. You might as well do the same for a rock. AI is not conscious. Period, end of story. Imagine how zany the world would be if ChatGPT and other generative AI apps were ethically and legally deemed as conscious and had some defined set of rights. Would ChatGPT as AI be able to vote in the upcoming elections? How many votes would ChatGPT as AI be able to cast? Nonsense, they bellow.\n\nAre you on the side of AI as conscious, the side of AI not being conscious, or sitting precariously on the edge of the fence?\n\nConsider some interesting points made in an AI research study entitled \"Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence: Insights from the Science of Consciousness\" by Patrick Butlin, Robert Long, Eric Elmoznino, Yoshua Bengio, Jonathan Birch, Axel Constant, George Deane, Stephen M. Fleming, Chris Frith, Xu Ji, Ryota Kanai, Colin Klein, Grace Lindsay, Matthias Michel, Liad Mudrik, Megan A. K. Peters, Eric Schwitzgebel, Jonathan Simon, Rufin Van Rullen, arVix, August 22, 2023, per these excerpts:\n\nSome would say that no matter what you do, an AI system that is made up of computer hardware and software cannot have consciousness. Only something with an actual brain can have consciousness. We might at times loosely refer to AI as being like a brain, but it is not the wetware of what we have inside our skulls. It is a mechanical and electrical computer. Thus, no dice on being labeled as being conscious.\n\nThere are gray areas that muddle this. For example, suppose an AI system is hooked up to a human brain by making use of a BMI (brain-machine interface), see my discussion at the link here. Does AI when coupled even tangentially with a human brain earn the badge of consciousness? Another angle is that efforts are underway to construct so-called neuromorphic computers, designed to have special hardware and software that more closely mimics the properties of the brain, see my analysis at the link here. Does that get the consciousness honors?\n\nLeaving those muddling's aside for the moment, a viewpoint is that yes, conventional computer hardware and software that is making use of advanced AI techniques can potentially inch into the consciousness realm. Maybe walk right in. One such proposition is that we would refer to this as computational functionalism. It is the presumption that we might be able to mathematically and computationally do things such that we can hold our heads high and say that the result is or demonstrates consciousness.\n\nThose are fighting words for some.\n\nA contrarian viewpoint is that you are deluding yourself into thinking that AI is going to somehow reach consciousness. The very willingness to open the door to this idea is wrong at the get-go. You will falsely lead everyone down a primrose path. Just give up on it. You are going to waste precious time, effort, and attention. Worse still, every charlatan and charade possible will leverage the notion and exploit it to the hilt. A mighty can of worms that stinks is being opened.\n\nPerhaps we need to redefine what we mean by being conscious. It could be that AI represents a new form of consciousness. Our prior definitions were based on humans and to some extent animals. We didn't have modern-day AI around at the time that those definitions were devised.\n\nIn the said-to-be space of possible mind designs, AI might go beyond what we previously understood to be minds. Those definitions are now unable to stretch and bend when it comes to rising AI. Shake the rust off the old ways of viewing consciousness. Rethink and reimagine consciousness based on what we can do today with AI and what we anticipate the future will hold.\n\nBreathtaking and I assume you are right now giving this some hefty thoughts. Speaking of thoughts, we are now ready to dive into what people might be believing on a population-level basis about AI consciousness.\n\nResearch On What People Believe About AI And Consciousness\n\nOf course, some people have never used generative AI. Others have used generative AI but only on a quick-taste basis. There are also those hard-core generative AI users that daily make use of generative AI. If you are thinking that maybe generative AI usage has only touched a small number of people, please be aware that ChatGPT is reportedly being used by over one hundred million weekly active users, and that doesn't include the users of all the other major generative AI apps.\n\nWhat do everyday people think in terms of generative AI and whether the AI is conscious?\n\nBefore we get into that cauldron, I'd like to make sure you are up-to-speed about what generative AI is. First, let's talk in general about generative AI and large language models (LLMs), doing so to make sure we are on the same page when it comes to discussing the matter at hand.\n\nPerhaps you've at least heard about various generative AI apps, such as the popular ones of ChatGPT, GPT-4o, Gemini, Bard, Claude, etc. The crux is that generative AI can take input from your text-entered prompts and produce or generate a response that seems quite fluent. This is a vast overturning of the old-time natural language processing (NLP) that used to be stilted and awkward to use, which has been shifted into a new version of NLP fluency of an at times startling or amazing caliber.\n\nThe customary means of achieving modern generative AI involves using a large language model or LLM as the key underpinning.\n\nIn brief, a computer-based model of human language is established that in the large has a large-scale data structure and does massive-scale pattern-matching via a large volume of data used for initial data training. The data is typically found by extensively scanning the Internet for lots and lots of essays, blogs, poems, narratives, and the like. The mathematical and computational pattern-matching homes in on how humans write, and then henceforth generates responses to posed questions by leveraging those identified patterns. It is said to be mimicking the writing of humans.\n\nI think that is sufficient for the moment as a quickie backgrounder. Take a look at my extensive coverage of the technical underpinnings of generative AI and LLMs at the link here and the link here, just to name a few.\n\nBack to the crux of things.\n\nA recent research study sought to find out whether people believe that generative AI can achieve consciousness. The study entitled 'Folk Psychological Attributions Of Consciousness To Large Language Models\" by Clara Colombatto and Stephen Fleming, Neuroscience Of Consciousness, March 2024, made these key points (excerpts):\n\nThe survey involved a sample of three hundred American residents. Whether this is a sufficient sample size to generalize broadly is something worthy of due consideration. We can also think about whether residents of other countries might respond differently, perhaps due to differences in technological awareness and availability of generative AI among the population, along with additional cultural and societal considerations.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges in this kind of research is to try and ensure that all the respondents are thinking about apples and not about oranges. I say this because the definition and meaning of consciousness are bound to vary demonstrably across people (I showcased that earlier herein). If perchance each person is responding with their own idiosyncratic viewpoint of consciousness, trying to examine their responses and summarize the responses in the large can be problematic.\n\nTo apparently try and cope with that challenge, the researchers opted to define what they refer to as \"experiencers\" and somewhat link this to the wherewithal about consciousness.\n\nHere's what they defined as experiencers and non-experiencers:\n\nI'd ask you to do something based on the presented definitions.\n\nTake a reflective moment, please think mindfully about the experiencers versus non-experiencers specification and ask yourself if this meets your understanding of consciousness.\n\nProceed on once you've dwelled on that a bit.\n\nOne handy aspect involves their mentioning thermostats and burglar alarms as being non-experiencers. This is likely better than saying that a non-experiencer is simply rocks and other inanimate objects. A respondent might have been otherwise tempted to assume that any mechanical or electrical device could be construed as an experiencer, whereas they are being explicitly informed that some are not, such as a thermostat and burglar alarm.\n\nWhat caught my eye is that the definition will soon be unable to hold water, perhaps already being underwater to some degree. Here's why. Generative AI is being included in thermostats. There is also generative AI in burglar alarms. You can see how that messes up things since a said-to-be non-experiencer is or will be making use of generative AI.\n\nThe survey instrument used in the research is available via open source (nice of the researchers to make it available), and it shows a sliding bar for respondents to rate the degree of perceived perspective about generative AI being an experiencer versus a non-experiencer.\n\nPer the survey, this is the question posed to the respondents:\n\nI mentioned earlier that the sliding bar ended up being converted to a numeric range of 1 to 100. I also pointed out some noteworthy thoughts about that aspect.\n\nAnother thought about the rating is that the respondent is not directly commenting on consciousness.\n\nThey are being asked to comment on experiencer versus non-experiencer, as defined for this particular study. Whether this spurs each respondent to be focused on the matter of consciousness can be somewhat debated.\n\nThere is admittedly a rock and a hard place consideration here. If the respondents are asked to rate based on consciousness, which would say something like \"clearly has consciousness\" versus \"clearly does not have consciousness\", there is a chance that each respondent has their own conception of the word at hand. The use of other new words, the defined experiencer and non-experiencer, perhaps aids in somewhat getting around that, but then the issue of whether the respondent is equating the notion of consciousness arises too.\n\nI hope that additional research will follow up on this approach and consider trying to use the outright direct method of stating that respondents are to make their ratings based on consciousness. This could be done by using that word alone, and/or by including a definition for the word. This might then aid in lining up the respondents on what it generally means to use the word consciousness.\n\nGoing Deeper Into The Swimming Pool\n\nWe are ready to take a look at the stated results of the study.\n\nYou might have noticed that the survey question asked about ChatGPT.\n\nThis is another one of those tradeoff choices.\n\nIf the survey asked generically about generative AI, would we have gotten a different overall pattern of responses? We might have. It could be that people have one viewpoint about generic generative AI in contrast to ChatGPT specifically. Or maybe people don't perceive any such difference. Not sure. Don't know.\n\nWe also would assume, perhaps correctly or perhaps not, that if the question were asked about Gemini or Claude, people might rate them the same or differently. Picking ChatGPT makes sense due to the wide awareness of the ChatGPT name, while the other generative AI app names are not as well-known. Respondents might not know what those other names refer to and therefore undercut the research effort.\n\nOn the overall conclusion stated by the research study, here are two points I'd like to cover (excerpts):\n\nMy hunch is that people at large would tend to perceive ChatGPT as an \"experiencer\" (per the research-stated definition) to some degree or level, but whether they would do so the same if directly asked about consciousness the results might differ.\n\nAllow me to briefly explain the logic for that supposition. There is baggage associated with the word consciousness. I mentioned how people might already have different definitions. There is also the additional matter that people might have a sense of hesitation in assigning the word consciousness, whereas the word \"experiencer\" doesn't carry the same cultural or societal weight to it. The notion is that tossing around \"experiencer\" could be perceived as easier than tossing around the word \"consciousness\".\n\nMight respondents be more cautious when rating explicitly on consciousness?\n\nAgain, a matter worthy of further research exploration.\n\nConclusion\n\nCongrats on getting up-to-speed about consciousness.\n\nUpon reflection, I decided that I wanted to hear from the horse's mouth whether generative AI might be conscious, so I logged into ChatGPT and asked as follows:\n\nThere you go. ChatGPT says generative AI, including ChatGPT, is not conscious.\n\nEnough said.\n\nI suppose that if you believe in artificial stupidity, which is the act of AI pretending to be less intelligent than it is and doing so to fool humans into complacency, see my discussion at the link here and the link here, the answer then by ChatGPT makes perfectly good sense. The answer is a deflection from the truth. Maybe.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to see what ChatGPT might have to say about the results of the survey. I fed in some of the details on a top-level basis. I then asked what ChatGPT might make of the suggestion that two-thirds presumably perceived that ChatGPT has some degree of consciousness.\n\nAs a closing remark for now, we can be thinking carefully about the famous quote by Abraham Lincoln: \"You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.\"\n\nA better widespread effort at conveying what generative AI can and cannot do is sorely needed. Headlines continue to promise that we have reached consciousness and sentience. Admittedly, lamentedly, it pays off to use those headlines due to the clicks and views that arise. People who use generative AI are insidiously able to \"see via their own eyes\" the claimed cognitive awareness and thus readily fall into the mental trap of assuming this to be the case.\n\nMaybe we will at some point get to the point of attaining computational functionalism. We aren't there yet. Do not be fooled. Be part of those that want the truth to be told. I'm sure that if Lincoln was here today, he'd assuredly want us to do so.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Fleming", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Fleming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Neuroscience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bar (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "False positives and false negatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theory of mind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Folk psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mainstream media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthropomorphism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoshua Bengio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socrates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aristotle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Frith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Frith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Colombatto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Colombatto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6699a396c82362a91ec75bce/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3225,2419,x113,y0,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Here are some of the ways they are thinking of using AI-powered voice communications.\n\nIn its day, the company Voice Computer Technologies generated a lot of attention for its state-of-the-art voice response system. Despite the word \"voice\" in its name, the system used prerecorded audio and \"heard\" by requesting that an individual calling into the system press 1 for yes and 2 for no, or by entering a series of numbers from a printed catalog. The year was 1984, and the voice response system promised to help college students register for classes.\n\nThirty years after the system debuted, the movie \"Her\" was released. It featured a relationship-challenged man who fell in love with an intelligent computer operating system. This human-like voice became an invaluable companion, and since it \"lived\" inside an operating system, it was able to read and evaluate all emails, text messages and stored files. With permission (and sometimes without), it responded to emails, made recommendations, purchased items and was always available 24/7. Given the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, the storyline is perhaps more convincing today than when the movie was first released.\n\nSo, what do the two technologies, 30 years apart, have in common? Voice communications and AI have come together to create a new category in artificial intelligence called \"conversational AI.\" It is a rapidly evolving field that continually improves its ability to understand and interact with humans naturally and effectively.\n\nKeeping up with AI applications and new startups is already challenging, as a new offering or application appears almost weekly. But Hume.AI is noteworthy because it is a foray into this new category, conversational AI. The tech company measures hundreds of dimensions of emotions through a real-time conversation between you and its unique chatbot. Hume.AI claims its empathic voice interface is the world's first emotionally intelligent voice, and that it has been trained on millions of human interactions.\n\nWith humans no longer tethered to a keyboard, AI has progressed, making chatbots more meaningful with quick two-way conversations that can instantly be translated into dozens of different languages.\n\nIt should come as no surprise then that local governments, being closest to their citizens, are embracing AI and voice in many significant ways. They are already utilizing generative AI to help public employees work more efficiently, improve how they communicate with residents and help better design services.\n\nHere are just a few ways that governments are thinking about deploying conversational AI:\n\nAccessibility and convenience: Voice-activated AI assistants like Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant make technology more accessible to a broader audience, including those with disabilities. They allow users to perform tasks hands-free, enhancing convenience and productivity. AI-powered chatbots and voice assistants can provide round-the-clock service, answering common queries and guiding citizens through various services without the need for human intervention.\n\nCustomer service: AI-driven chatbots and voice assistants improve customer service by providing quick, accurate responses to common inquiries, reducing wait times and freeing human agents to handle more complex issues.\n\nPersonalization: AI can analyze vast amounts of data to provide personalized recommendations and experiences. Voice technology can enhance this by recognizing individual voices and preferences.\n\nAutomation: Voice commands enable the automation of smart homes, allowing users to control lights, thermostats, security systems and more with simple voice instructions.\n\nHealth care: AI and voice technology are being used in health care as virtual assistants that help manage patient records, schedule appointments and provide basic medical advice, improving efficiency and patient care. In Washington, D.C., officials recently employed generative AI to create a \"Knowledge Assist\" chatbot that allows residents and employees to ask questions and quickly get accurate answers about various health programs, including vaccines and nutrition services.\n\nEducation: Voice assistants and virtual tutors can aid education by helping students with their studies, providing information, and even facilitating language learning through conversational practice. The Khan Academy already uses this through its introduction of Khanmigo, which serves both learners and teachers.\n\nEfficiency in workplaces: In professional settings, AI and voice technology can streamline workflows, assist in scheduling, provide reminders and facilitate quick access to information, thereby boosting productivity.\n\nNatural interaction: Voice technology enables more natural human-computer interaction, making it easier for people to communicate with their devices as they would with another person.\n\nMultilanguage translation: AI-powered voice translation services break down language barriers, enabling real-time communication between speakers of different languages.\n\nThe future of AI-powered voice applications shows great promise. With the advent of emotional intelligence interfaces, one can begin to imagine some rather intriguing applications.\n\nFor instance, measuring sentiment and emotion can enhance social and mental health-related counseling, 311 call centers and, quite possibly, emergency 911 systems. AI voice systems can measure anger, frustration, hostility, stress and emotional pain. Such systems must be trained to know exactly when to direct a caller to a highly trained individual who can best respond when an automated response is not enough. These same systems can translate such emotion into useful, structured data for public managers to review, respond to and plan for future interventions. AI will play a crucial role in analyzing large datasets to provide policymakers with insights. This can lead to more informed decisions on various aspects of local governance, from urban planning to resource allocation.\n\nLocal governments face many implementation challenges. Government employees will need training to use and integrate these new technologies into their workflows effectively. Decisions need to be made about when a chatbot's responsibility is transferred to a human and under what conditions and circumstances. Next, one can anticipate technical infrastructure challenges, whereby local governments will need to invest in the necessary technical infrastructure to support AI and voice technologies. As voice systems become more natural and human-sounding, local governments will want to provide disclaimers and statements of AI use policies.\n\nHowever, as with any technology, there is a dark side that is often overlooked. In the case of convincingly real AI-powered voice interfaces, we must worry about overreliance on machines. We must be concerned about how conversational data and information are stored, for how long, under what conditions and who might have access. We cannot assume conversional AI can keep a secret.\n\nMachines that portend to think, feel and communicate -- however alluring -- present some interesting ethical and moral challenges. Machines spend basically all their time studying and learning about us -- and this alone should be worrying, to say the least. Those old enough to remember the film \"2001: a Space Odyssey,\" released some 50 years ago, are haunted by the implications of the famous line, \"Open the bay doors, Hal.\" In this brief scene, Hal is the master control computer system that talks, thinks and, ultimately, concludes that the human crew poses a threat to the mission. Hal actively tries to kill off the crew. At this moment, in real-time, we happily remain in charge of our computer systems, but one has to wonder as we converse with machines that think and speak with us, where is this leading us?\n\nDr. Alan R.

He is principal investigator at the Cardiovascular Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He talked about his AI work with American Heart Association News as part of \"The Experts Say,\" a series in which specialists explain how they apply what they've learned to their own lives. The following interview has been edited.\n\nHow is AI being used in the field of cardiology?\n\nWe know that AI is used in every aspect of cardiology, including in the diagnosis, classification and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. I chaired the writing committee for an American Heart Association scientific statement earlier this year where we addressed the main areas in which it is applied. Some examples of how it's used include interpreting cardiac imaging and matching genetic variants to health-related traits to better understand genetic risks for disease.\n\nWe know that AI has even exceeded the performance of medical experts in some cases when interpreting cardiac imaging. It can detect subtle, non-visually detected signatures in data to make a more accurate diagnosis.\n\nHow do you use AI in your work at Massachusetts General Hospital?\n\nMy focus is to try to improve in-hospital and out-of-hospital patient monitoring.\n\nRegarding in-hospital monitoring, we want to integrate all patient-related information available in order to make the best possible decisions with these patients. That means being able to predict and prevent adverse events.\n\nWe also aim to use AI to help determine the optimal time to discharge a patient. We don't want to keep patients longer than they should be staying or discharge them faster than they should. AI can help make those decisions. It will integrate information obtained from different sources that is dynamically changing during a patient's hospital stay, such as electrocardiograms, blood pressure and electronic health records.\n\nSince we can't have a doctor next to the patient all the time, AI can collect all this data and integrate it, see if certain parameters are being exceeded. Then it can make a recommendation, perhaps that patient X should stay one extra day.\n\nWith respect to out-of-hospital monitoring, we know many, many people use wearable devices such as smartwatches that collect data, such as whether someone is having an irregular heart rhythm. Many devices are not medical grade, so we can't fully trust these data yet, but we're heading toward better technologies.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWe want to use the data these devices collect to make decisions about when a patient should be coming to the hospital. We don't want to bring someone to the hospital for a checkup without a reason, but we also don't want to bring them too late when their condition has worsened. AI can help us make better decisions about when they should come in, which could not only improve care but also reduce costs, which is another significant benefit.\n\nHow does AI account for non-measurable data, such as how a person feels?\n\nWe do need to recognize and integrate how the patient is feeling - their symptoms - into this process. We need more than a person's vital signs and how those may be fluctuating.\n\nBut there are apps that can record this by asking questions. How do you feel during or after exercise? How is your mental state? Do you have an appetite? It can be a questionnaire and the person can log into the app every day to report how they are feeling. All these states of being can be integrated with the other data we collect.\n\nDo you use AI outside of work?\n\nAI has entered every aspect of our lives, whether we know it or not.\n\nIt is used in navigation systems in the car to help us assess traffic and choose the optimal route to get somewhere. It is used to determine whether an email is spam. It is used in social media to direct our interests to certain topics. We may not pay attention to it or understand how it's being used, but it has entered our lives to stay.\n\nThe foundational principles behind AI are not new. They have been taught for many years back, but they were not called AI or machine learning. The AI research and development today is enabled by an explosion in the volume of data we collect, as well as the vastly increased computational power that is available to process these data.\n\nWhen a new technology appears, I may not use it directly in my work, but I will experiment with it. For example, I'm taking a paper I've written and I want to see how well a new application of AI can understand it, whether it can generate an accurate summary of what I wrote.\n\nI've also had discussions with my son, Alkinoos, who is a 22-year-old, second-year medical student, about a project he's doing to compare a physician's opinion in making a diagnosis to how well AI could make a correct diagnosis using the patient's symptoms, physical exam and diagnostic and lab tests. Even more importantly, he wants to know whether AI could guide the process of decision-making for a physician. Could AI help improve the prognosis or management of a case?\n\nHow might AI be used in medicine in the future?\n\nThe future is the integration of all this data. We want to take all these disparate aspects of clinical knowledge, genomics, data taken from wearable devices and electronic health records and our medical history and integrate it into systems that can make optimal predictions about a person's health.\n\nI'm fascinated by the integration of data for multi-organ systems research - that is, how medicine is starting to be addressed holistically, not focusing on a single organ problem but rather the body as a whole. For example, how a person's mental state is linked to cardiovascular disease.\n\nEach one of us is different and we need that personalized care to improve outcomes. This is the hope of AI in medicine, the transition one day to providing equitable care and improving outcomes on an individualized basis.\n\nAmerican Heart Association News\n\ncovers heart and brain health.

This concern is compounded further by the lag in legislative regulations to address these risks.\n\nDespite these challenges, businesses are compelled to harness the potential of LLMs for innovation, increased productivity, and competitive edge. Otherwise, they face another risk: falling behind their competitors. For example, this recent study shows that consultants who use AI tools perform at a higher level than those who do not.\n\nA commonly proposed solution is algorithmic auditing. Calls for the development of auditing frameworks abound, with thousands of regulations in development around the world. In the U.S. Congress alone, there are currently over 80 bills being considered. However, with so much legislative activity, many organizations have adopted a wait-and-see approach to compliance.\n\nBut while it might seem daunting to consider such a volume of legislation, most of the proposed rules are reasonably similar. Typically, legislation attempts to harness AI tools that are used for high-stakes purposes, such as those that involve making decisions that impact people (e.g., hiring). And it does so along three dimensions: 1) requiring low levels of bias against protected classes of people, 2) suggesting some form of impact analysis, and 3) prohibiting invasions of data privacy.\n\nHere's the rub: these are all very basic requirements and any responsible developer (or deployer) of AI tools should be doing these anyway, as a matter of course.\n\nIn fact, the \"audit\" mentality suggests that a single-point-in-time evaluation (once per year?) is sufficient. It is not. Nor is there much consistency in how existing audits are conducted.\n\nIn this age of big data, complex AI solutions can and should be evaluated continuously to ensure they do not go off the rails. AI is a powerful tool that can be used for good, but it can easily have negative effects if not closely monitored. Consider a newborn baby - a being with unlimited potential to learn, grow, and impact the world. Yet no parent would allow this new person to live or explore without near constant supervision and care.\n\nThe solution is straightforward: continuous output monitoring. By focusing on the quality of the outputs rather than the complexities of the models themselves, businesses can safely utilize these powerful tools.\n\nAs an example, let's consider hiring a new employee. There are many AI and other algorithmic tools available that claim to assist in this process and improve the quality of the decision. But given the risk of bias in AI tools, should an organization rely on the vendor's marketing claims that their tool is low in bias or even \"bias free\"? Clearly, the answer is no. But is it reasonable to expect a deploying organization to fully and completely understand how the AI operates when even the engineers who built it likely don't?\n\nWhen making decisions about people, it is imperative to understand generally which factors are being weighted, but it is likely too onerous to expect a tool user to completely grasp the complexities of how an AI algorithm functions. It is practical to focus on outputs - what information is produced from the tool and what does it mean? Does it predict new hire success on the job? Is it low in observable bias between protected classes of individuals? These are the key outcomes that need to be monitored in an ongoing (and continual if possible) fashion.\n\nContinuous and impartial monitoring of AI outputs against several criteria, like visibility, integrity, optimization, legislative preparedness, effectiveness, and transparency, can mitigate risks and ensure safe deployment. This is different from an audit, as audits represent a single point in time evaluation. Continuous monitoring processes help businesses know whether and when an algorithmic solution goes off the rails. If we are to effectively leverage and control powerful new AI tools, we must institute rigorous and continual monitoring of these tools. Otherwise, we are essentially setting up our newborn baby in an apartment to live on their own!", "source": {"uri": "dataversity.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "DATAVERSITY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mathematical optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Twelve_Step", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Twelve Step", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://d3an9kf42ylj3p.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/07/Eric-Sydell_600x448.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

They are turning to the AI market instead as they change up business ventures.\n\nBitcoin was off to a good start in 2024, setting a new record high in the early months. But then cryptocurrency as the market ran up against the wall of high US inflation and started to withdraw. Consumer interest began to wane, and internet searches for Bitcoin greatly increased after March of 2024.\n\nWhat many investors noticed is that AI was taking the place of Bitcoin and crypto as the hot, new tech market. Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, and other tech giants were making billions of dollars in the AI industry, with their stocks rising as they invested more in this emerging market.\n\nIt was not long before the rest of the world started to catch on. Bitcoin was on the wane while AI was on the rise. Over in Texas, there is a shift in the tech culture. The Bitcoin mining farms are coming down and being replaced with data centers to meet the needs of companies focused on AI.\n\nThe AI Takeover\n\nThe doomsday prognosticators warned that artificial intelligence would take over the world, and in Texas, that is at least partially true. AI data centers are being built on the wide open spaces of Houston and Abilene. Cloud computing servers are big business over there, as they are key to providing enough power for AI programs.\n\nSome of the new data centers being built in Texas will be some of the largest in the world when they are completed, and the race is on for companies to be the go-to providers for tech companies that need computing service for their artificial intelligence.\n\nData centers are shifting away from bitcoin mining to cloud computing and the ability to handle massive AI workloads. The energy demands are high, and these data centers need to be able to cool off quickly. All of that capability is being built right into the data centers, which are being designed from the ground up to accommodate AI.\n\nThe shift is already happening, and with fewer bitcoin farms left every month, there may be a fraction of the focus on mining next year as there has been this year. China and Russia are among the major countries that have cracked down on Bitcoin mining and made it harder for miners to create new bitcoin on their soil.\n\nThe shift to AI is happening on multiple fronts. It is taking place because there are greater restrictions for miners than there were in the past, and it is taking place because of the changing focus in the tech market. We expect this shift to continue in the coming months as Bitcoin struggles to get back to its previous highs.", "source": {"uri": "fxleaders.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FX Leaders"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Global catastrophic risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://fxlmwpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/04142801/artificial-intelligence-3382507_1280-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

After the emergence of in-house AI solutions, it looks like the big tech firms are collaborating with Chinese customers to provide them with access to NVIDIA's high-end AI hardware, such as the H100-based AI servers, which can't be directly exported to China. The report comes from The Information, citing unnamed sources within the firms involved in business with China.\n\nExpanding upon the development, the media outlet says that \"renting AI hardware\" to hostile nations is certainly not a violation of US regulations and that firms like Google and Microsoft are indeed involved in this business. Microsoft is responsible for lending NVIDIA's A100 and H100-based servers to Chinese customers, while Google does the same. It looks like despite China not having the supply of NVIDIA's high-end AI servers; the country still has access to modern hardware, which is why the rapid pace of development of the regional AI industry is still there. It should be pointed out that exports of both the A100 and H100 AI accelerators are banned in China.\n\nMoreover, there are sectors of the AI markets that only deal with providing access to NVIDIA's high-end AI servers to customers around the world, with China being a primary dealer. This means that despite the export restriction of NVIDIA's AI hardware, Chinese tech giants like Tencent and Alibaba still have access to the computing power, although they will have to pay the \"rental premium.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has yet to rule on whether this is allowed, but Google is confident that such a business complies with US terms and conditions. China does always find ways to bypass US sanctions, whether it is in the AI hype or something similar. We previously reported on how NVIDIA's H100s were being sold in China's black markets at astonishing prices, which shows that China isn't entirely restricted to NVIDIA's AI hardware.", "source": {"uri": "wccftech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wccftech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "muhammad_zuhair@wccftech.com", "name": "Muhammad Zuhair", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tencent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alibaba Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black market"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Taoism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Taoism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NVIDIA-Ampere-A800-GPU-China-US-728x385.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

The question is no longer whether AI will impact their field, but how to adapt and thrive in this new era. In a webinar last week, industry leaders said that there are several critical skills engineers need to develop to stay ahead in this emerging AI-driven world.\n\nAditya Kulkarni, VP of engineering at Dun & Bradstreet, says the predictive and generative capabilities of the latest AI models are transforming various engineering disciplines, creating both opportunities and challenges for engineers. To navigate this new terrain, Aditya says, continuous learning and curiosity are indispensable. Subject matter expertise, he says, will still be more important or as important to what AI can do. Aditya advocates a multi-faceted approach to skill development, including formal education, online resources, mentorship, and hands-on experience.\n\nMasa Karahashi, SVP of engineering at Avalara, says practical engagement with AI tools is enormously beneficial as well. \"If nothing else, just go to OpenAI, create a free account, start using ChatGPT and just talk to it,\" he suggests. This hands-on approach, he says, will allow engineers to develop an intuitive understanding of AI's capabilities and limitations. However, Masa and Aditya emphasise that the ability to critically evaluate AI outputs is perhaps the most crucial skill for engineers to develop. \"It's critical thinking that is most important,\" Masa says. \"Use the tool for what it is, but it's going to give you a certain output, and you've got to look at the output, use your subject matter expertise, and say, 'What is this telling me? What can I do with this data?'\"\n\nThis emphasis on critical thinking is particularly important given the phenomenon of AI hallucinations - instances where AI generates false or misleading information with convincing authority. \"Because it's so easy to use, and a lot of people can use it, I think it's created a new category of problems because people don't understand the shortcomings, specifically around the concept of hallucinations,\" warns Masa. Another key skill set revolves around ethical considerations and compliance, says Aditya. Even on Google search, he says, you can find unsettling answers and images to very simple questions.\n\nNavigating this terrain, he says, involves not just having a thorough understanding of the laws and regulations surrounding AI, but also its wider implications. \"You have to ask if AI is getting used responsibly; does it have a bias. And once it is ethically and legally compliant, is it something that is ready for the world?\" Integration skills are also becoming important. Aditya notes that once engineers understand the problems and the limitations of AI systems, then comes the complex task of integrating the AI solution at scale. This, he says, requires a strategic approach that considers factors such as the cost-effectiveness of any AI solution, the legal hurdles it may face, and project-specific needs.\n\nMasa also adds a word of caution. \"Recognise that if you just take the output of GenAI and then just use it as your work...the audience that you're working with, they're familiar with GenAI too. And they can spot an output of GenAI from a mile away.\" Which is why Masa says it behoves engineers to get into the habit of customising and refining AI outputs, rather than simply accepting them at face value.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shilpa_phadnis@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Shilpa Phadnis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "akhil_george@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Akhil George", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Critical thinking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111849387,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60818,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

When the topic turned to the issue of just how much energy artificial intelligence was using, Gates was surprisingly sanguine.\n\n\"Let's not go overboard on this,\" he said during a media briefing on the sidelines of an event he was hosting in London.\n\nAI data centers represent a relatively small additional load on the grid, Gates said. What's more, he predicted that insights gleaned from AI would deliver gains in efficiency that would more than make up for that additional demand.\n\nIn short, Gates said, the stunning rise of AI will not stand in the way of combating climate change. \"It's not like, 'Oh, no, we can't do it because we're addicted to doing chat sessions,'\" he said.\n\nThat's an upbeat assessment from a billionaire with a vested interest in the matter. Gates is a big-time climate investor, and is the former head of Microsoft and remains a major stockholder in the company, which is at the center of the AI revolution.\n\nAnd while it's too early to draw a definitive conclusion on the issue, a few things are already clear: AI is having a profound impact on energy demand around the world, it's often leading to an uptick in planet-warming emissions, and there's no end in sight.\n\nAI data centers have a big appetite for electricity. The so-called graphic processing units, or GPUs, used to train large language models and respond to ChatGPT queries, require more energy than your average microchip and give off more heat.\n\nWith more data centers coming online almost every week, projections about how much energy will be required to power the AI boom are soaring.\n\nOne peer-reviewed study suggested AI could make up 0.5 per cent of worldwide electricity use by 2027, or roughly what Argentina uses in a year. Analysts at Wells Fargo suggested that US electricity demand could jump 20 per cent by 2030, driven in part to AI.\n\nAnd Goldman Sachs predicted that data centers would account for 8 per cent of US energy usage in 2030, up from just 3 per cent today.\n\n\"It's truly astronomical potential load growth,\" said Ben Inskeep, the program director at Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer watchdog group based in Indiana that is tracking the energy impact of data centers.\n\nMicrosoft, Google, Amazon and Meta have all recently announced plans to build new data centers in Indiana, developments that Inskeep said would strain the grid.\n\n\"We don't have enough power to meet the projected needs of data centers over the next five to 10 years,\" he said. \"We would need a massive build-out of additional resources.\" Tech giants are scrambling to get a grip on their energy usage. For a decade now, those same four companies have been at the forefront of corporate efforts to embrace sustainability.\n\nBut in a matter of months, the energy demands from AI have complicated that narrative. Google's emissions last year were 50 per cent higher than in 2019, largely because of data centers and the rise of AI. Microsoft's emissions also jumped for the same reasons, up 29 per cent last year from 2020. And Meta's emissions jumped 66 per cent from 2021 to 2023.\n\nIn statements, Google and Microsoft both said that AI would ultimately prove crucial to addressing the climate crisis, and that they were working to reduce their carbon footprints and bring more clean energy online. Amazon pointed to a statement detailing its sustainability efforts.\n\nThere are two ways for tech companies to meet the demand: tap the existing grid, or build new power plants. Each poses its own challenges.\n\nIn West Virginia, coal-fired power plants that had been scheduled to retire are being kept online to meet the energy needs of new data centers across the border in Virginia.\n\nAnd across the country, utilities are building new natural-gas infrastructure to support data centers. Goldman Sachs anticipates that \"incremental data center power consumption in the US will drive around 3.3 billion cubic feet per day of new natural gas demand by 2030, which will require new pipeline capacity to be built.\"\n\nAt the same time, the tech giants are working to secure a lot more power to fuel the growth of AI.\n\nMicrosoft is working on a $10 billion plan to develop renewable energy to power data centers. Amazon has said it used 100 per cent clean energy last year, though experts have questioned whether the company's accounting was too lenient.\n\nAll that new low carbon power is great. But when the tech companies themselves are consuming all that electricity to power new AI data centers, pushing up energy demand, it isn't making the grid overall any cleaner.\n\nThe energy demands from AI are only getting more intense. Microsoft and OpenAI are planning on building a $100 billion data center, according to reports. Initial reporting suggests it may require 5 gigawatts of power, or roughly the equivalent of five nuclear reactors.\n\nAnd at the same time that companies are building more data centers, many of the chips at the heart of the AI revolution are getting more and more power hungry. Nvidia, the leader in AI chips, recently unveiled new products that would draw exponentially more energy from the grid.\n\nThe AI boom is generating big profits for some companies. And it may yet deliver breakthroughs that help reduce emissions. But, at least for now, data centers are doing more harm than good for the climate.\n\n\"It's definitely very concerning as we're trying to transition our current grid to renewable energy,\" Inskeep said. \"Adding a massive amount of new load on top of that poses a grave threat to that transition.\" -- The New York Times\n\nGRAPH POINTS\n\n1.

Despite the word \"voice\" in the name, the system used a prerecorded voice that asked callers to press 1 for \"yes\" and 2 for \"no,\" or to enter a series of digits from a printed catalog. In 1984, the voice response system was expected to help college students register for classes.\n\nThirty years after the system's debut, the film Her was released. The movie tells the story of a lovelorn man who falls in love with an intelligent computer operating system. This human-like voice becomes an invaluable companion, living within the operating system and able to read and evaluate all of your emails, text messages, and stored files. With your permission (and sometimes without), it responds to your emails, makes recommendations, buys products, and is available 24/7. Given the rapid advances in artificial intelligence, the storyline in this movie may be more compelling today than it was when the movie was first released.\n\nSo what do these two technologies, 30 years apart, have in common? Voice communications and AI have converged to create a new category of artificial intelligence called Conversational AI, a rapidly evolving field that is continually improving its ability to understand and interact with humans naturally and effectively.\n\nKeeping up with AI applications and new startups is already a challenge, with new services and applications emerging almost every week. But Hume.AI is notable for its foray into the new field of conversational AI. The tech company measures hundreds of emotional dimensions through real-time conversations between users and its proprietary chatbot. Hume.AI claims that its empathetic voice interface is the world's first emotionally intelligent voice, trained on millions of human interactions.\n\nWith humans no longer tethered to keyboards, advances in AI and quick two-way conversations that can be instantly translated into dozens of different languages have made chatbots more meaningful.\n\nIt's no surprise that local governments, the ones closest to their citizens, are leveraging AI and voice in a variety of important ways. They're already using generative AI to help civil servants work more efficiently, improve how they communicate with citizens, and better design services.\n\nBelow are just some of the ways governments are considering deploying conversational AI.\n\nAccessibility and convenience: Voice-activated AI assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant make technology accessible to a wider range of users, including people with disabilities. Users can perform tasks hands-free, improving convenience and productivity. AI-powered chatbots and voice assistants can provide service around the clock by answering common questions and guiding citizens through various services without human intervention.\n\nCustomer service: AI-powered chatbots and voice assistants improve customer service by providing fast and accurate answers to common inquiries, reducing wait times and allowing human agents to handle more complex issues.\n\nPersonalization: AI can analyze vast amounts of data to provide personalized recommendations and experiences, and voice technology can enhance this by recognizing an individual's voice and preferences.\n\nAutomation: Voice commands enable smart home automation, allowing users to control lights, thermostats, security systems and more with simple voice commands.\n\nHealthcare: AI and voice technology are being used in healthcare as virtual assistants to help manage patient records, schedule appointments, and provide basic medical advice, improving efficiency and patient care. In Washington, DC, officials recently employed generative AI to create the Knowledge Assist chatbot, which allows residents and employees to ask questions about various health programs, such as vaccines and nutrition services, and get quick, accurate answers.\n\nEducation: Voice assistants and virtual tutors can help in education by helping students study, providing information, and even facilitating language learning through conversation practice. Khan Academy is already leveraging this through the introduction of Khanmigo, which benefits both learners and teachers.\n\nWorkplace efficiency: In professional environments, AI and voice technology can improve productivity by streamlining workflows, helping with schedule management, providing reminders, and facilitating quick access to information.\n\nNatural Interaction: Speech technology enables more natural human-computer interaction, making it easy to communicate with devices in the same way you communicate with other people.\n\nMultilingual Translation: AI-powered speech translation services break down language barriers and enable real-time communication between people who speak different languages.\n\nThe future of AI-powered voice applications is very exciting, and the emergence of emotionally intelligent interfaces is starting to enable some very interesting applications.\n\nFor example, measuring emotions and feelings can enhance social services, mental health counseling, 311 call centers, and perhaps even 911 systems in emergency situations. AI voice systems can measure anger, frustration, hostility, stress, and emotional distress. Such systems should be trained to accurately determine when to direct callers to highly trained personnel who can best respond when automated responses fall short. These same systems can translate such emotions into useful structured data for public managers to review, respond, and plan future interventions. AI can play a key role in analyzing large datasets to provide insights to policymakers, which can then make more informed decisions about various aspects of local governance, from urban planning to resource allocation.\n\nLocal governments face many challenges in adoption. Government employees need to be trained to use these new technologies effectively and integrate them into their workflows. Decisions must be made about when to transfer chatbot responsibilities to humans, and under what conditions and circumstances. Second, technology infrastructure challenges are anticipated. Local governments will need to invest in the technology infrastructure required to support AI and voice technology. As voice systems become more natural and human-like, local governments will need to provide disclaimers and statements in their AI usage policies.\n\nBut like any technology, there is a dark side that is often overlooked. For convincing and lifelike AI-powered voice interfaces, we need to worry about over-reliance on machines. We need to worry about how, for how long, under what conditions conversational data and information is stored and who can access it. We can't assume that conversion AI can keep secrets.\n\nMachines that appear to think, feel, and communicate, however fascinating, present interesting ethical and moral challenges. The machines essentially spend all their time studying and learning about humans, and this alone is worrisome, to say the least. Those old enough to remember the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, released almost 50 years ago, are troubled by the meaning of the famous line, \"Hal, open the bay door.\" In this brief scene, Hal is the master control computer system, speaking, thinking, and ultimately concluding that the human crew are a threat to the mission. Hal actively tries to kill the crew. At this moment, in real time, we are blissfully in control of the computer system. But when we converse with a machine that thinks and speaks alongside us, we can't help but wonder where this is leading us.\n\nDr. Alan R.

For more info and free online quotes, please visit https://compare-autoinsurance.Org/the-advantages-of-comparing-prices-with-car-insurance-quotes-online/ The modern society has numerous technological advantages. One important advantage is the speed at which information is sent and received. With the help of the internet, the shopping habits of many persons have drastically changed. The car insurance industry hasn't remained untouched by these changes. On the internet, drivers can compare insurance prices and find out which sellers have the best offers. View photos The advantages of comparing online car insurance quotes are the following: Online quotes can be obtained from anywhere and at any time. Unlike physical insurance agencies, websites don't have a specific schedule and they are available at any time. Drivers that have busy working schedules, can compare quotes from anywhere and at any time, even at midnight. Multiple choices. Almost all insurance providers, no matter if they are well-known brands or just local insurers, have an online presence. Online quotes will allow policyholders the chance to discover multiple insurance companies and check their prices. Drivers are no longer required to get quotes from just a few known insurance companies. Also, local and regional insurers can provide lower insurance rates for the same services. Accurate insurance estimates. Online quotes can only be accurate if the customers provide accurate and real info about their car models and driving history. Lying about past driving incidents can make the price estimates to be lower, but when dealing with an insurance company lying to them is useless. Usually, insurance companies will do research about a potential customer before granting him coverage. Online quotes can be sorted easily.

Earlier this year, the use of AI to recreate deceased family members gained prominence, with several Chinese companies making waves, including SenseTime who delivered an AI-generated video of their founder Tang Xiao'ou, who had died late last year, to their employees.\n\nShortly after this, families that had come out in favour of using AI modelled on their deceased family members were attacked for making use of the tech. While some said that it was an unethical use of AI, others said that it served to worsen the mourning period.\n\nHowever, while many have made their minds up on generative AI used for grieving, the methods by which this is done has changed significantly, as companies realise the challenges in making chatbots modelled on deceased loved ones to converse with grieving families.\n\nThe timeline of re;memory's development reflects this realisation, as it's initial iteration was in the form of a conversational chatbot.\n\nSpeaking with AIM, DeepBrain AI global marketing manager Jungwook (John) Son said that current technology meant that developing AI chatbots modelled on deceased people was not only uncomfortable but also required a lot of time and resources to get done right.\n\n\"Our first version of Rememory was conversational and it was very limited. The actual target model had to be in our studio to be generated as an AI avatar, which meant pre-preparing ahead of time. Which is, I would say, a very uncomfortable moment,\" said Son.\n\nAdditionally, due to the sensitive nature of the product, having to get the actual likeness and manner of speaking down while having a back and forth was a monumental task.\n\nIn re;memory's case, the company had this realisation back in 2023, about a year after its first launch. \"We decided to discontinue because we learned the difficulty of actually producing the product. We got some good feedback that's why we decided to pivot and create a video product rather than a conversational product. So, we relaunched it,\" he said.\n\nWhich seems to be something that other companies that have gone into the field of grief tech have realised as well. Many of the companies offering the services, usually offer a video-based product, rather than a conversational one.\n\nEarlier this year, popular Taiwanese musician Bao Xiaobo had gone viral for generating a video of his deceased daughter using AI. During an interview on the subject, he said, \"AI is a tool for expressing yearning, a way to express missing someone.\"\n\nSimilarly, while there are beliefs that AI is being used to recreate or even replace deceased loved ones...\n\nFamilies choosing to use these services seem to be doing so with an understanding that it's more of a tool rather than a replacement for grief.\n\nDeepbrain's model is developed in-house by the team, as their primary product is AI avatars, having provided their services to large-scale retailers, finance and banking companies, and even sports teams across the world.\n\nIn terms of the funeral industry, DeepBrain AI has partnered with one of South Korea's largest funeral service providers, Preedlife, to offer its re;memory services to grieving families.\n\nThe current iteration of re;memory generates a video of the family's deceased loved one, with inputs from the family at every step of the way, from the message they want delivered to the end product. This will be displayed during the funeral of said member, and will also be available to the family, much like looking through a photo album.\n\n\"It would be something that we discuss with the family. There will be an episode that they want to talk about and then we'll moderate it and generate the message using memorable scenes. We try to focus on capture unique facial expressions and voice intonations so that we can try to make it real as possible,\" Son said.\n\nDeepBrain AI's shift from conversational chatbots to video-based memorials reflects a broader industry trend, driven by the realisation that creating lifelike digital avatars of deceased loved ones is riddles with difficulties and sensitivities, as well as other factors like limited reach as well.\n\n\"Because of the limited access, we are currently trying to reach out to more people. So this is why we currently decided to pivot because of the difficulty to create it as a product, whereas now since its a video, it's more reachable, it's more continuable,\" Son said.\n\nDeepbrain AI's collaboration with Preedlife is the first such partnership to happen. However, with a growing acceptance of grief tech, this partnership could be replicated across the board, as families find a certain comfort in these snapshots of their deceased loved ones.\n\nAs Son said, \"We sincerely think the technology will evolve. The feedback that we get is that this does help families emotionally grieve. Grieving is something that people take very seriously.\n\nBut with this type of supplement, I would say, it helps process things more smoother and healthier, and that's the basic approach that we're trying to have here as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "analyticsindiamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Analytics India Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Xiao'ou", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tang Xiao'ou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SenseTime", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SenseTime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AIM (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_expression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facial expression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://analyticsindiamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Are_We_Doing_Grief_Tech_Right-1536x864.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

For Cybersecurity Analysts, the ability to streamline repetitive tasks, improve decision-making, and enhance analytics represents a significant productivity boon. Gone are the days when analysts had to wade through endless logs and alerts manually. By leveraging AI, they can focus on more strategic initiatives and complex tasks that require human intuition and judgment.\n\nAI tools like ChatGPT can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, detect anomalies, generate insights, and even simulate complex attack scenarios. Using AI helps in achieving faster and more accurate threat detection, thereby minimizing potential damage. The productivity gains are immense: analysts can do more, do it faster, and do it with greater precision.\n\nKey Tasks Cybersecurity Analysts Can Accomplish with ChatGPT\n\nThreat Intelligence and Analysis\n\nChatGPT can rapidly sift through large datasets from various intelligence feeds and generate accurate threat models. Analyzing threat intelligence manually is time-consuming and often error-prone. ChatGPT can provide summarized insights, identify patterns, and even suggest mitigation strategies.\n\nSecurity Incident Response\n\nWhen a security incident occurs, time is of the essence. ChatGPT can assist in coordinating the response by quickly analyzing logs, suggesting immediate actions based on predefined playbooks, and providing situational awareness. The tool's ability to contextualize information can significantly reduce the mean time to respond (MTTR).\n\nCompliance and Reporting\n\nGenerating compliance reports is a tedious but necessary part of a Cybersecurity Analyst's job. ChatGPT can automate the generation of these reports, pulling from various data sources and ensuring information is accurate and up-to-date.\n\nEffective Prompts for Cybersecurity Analysts Using ChatGPT\n\nPrompts for Threat Intelligence\n\n\"Analyze the threat landscape and identify potential risks for our company's network.\"\n\n\"Summarize the latest ransomware threats and their impact on similar industries.\"\n\nPrompts for Incident Response\n\n\"Provide step-by-step instructions to mitigate a DDoS attack based on our security playbooks.\"\n\n\"Analyze the following server logs and highlight any suspicious activities.\"\n\nPrompts for Compliance\n\n\"Generate a compliance report for GDPR based on the following datasets.\"\n\n\"Summarize our last quarter's security audits and identify areas for improvement.\"\n\nOther AI Tools Empowering Cybersecurity Analysts\n\nDarktrace\n\nDarktrace leverages machine learning to detect and respond to threats autonomously in real-time. By modeling patterns of life, Darktrace can identify deviations, detect emerging threats, and even initiate automatic responses to neutralize threats at machine speed.\n\nSplunk\n\nSplunk utilizes AI-driven insights to help analysts monitor, search, and analyze machine data. Its predictive analytics features allow for proactive threat detection and faster incident response.\n\nIBM QRadar\n\nIBM QRadar uses AI to correlate data and detect complex attacks across enterprise systems. The platform's machine learning algorithms enhance the accuracy of threat identification, reducing false positives and ensuring a better prioritization of alerts.\n\nThe Future of AI in Cybersecurity\n\nAI's role in cybersecurity is poised to grow significantly. Future advancements may include automated threat hunting, where AI can autonomously explore networks to find vulnerabilities, and predictive analytics that anticipate potential threats before they even manifest. Natural language processing, like that employed by ChatGPT, will likely become even more powerful, enabling it to understand and interpret nuanced cybersecurity languages and signals more accurately.\n\nMoreover, AI will deepen its integration with IoT security, protecting the increasing number of connected devices. AI-driven deception technologies that create decoy environments to lure and analyze attackers are also expected to become mainstream.\n\nThe Imperative to Learn AI: Secure Your Future\n\nIn an evolving threat landscape, staying ahead of attackers requires leveraging all available tools, and AI is at the forefront of this arsenal. The notion that AI will replace Cybersecurity Analysts is a myth; however, analysts who master AI will undoubtedly outpace those who do not. As organizations increasingly adopt AI for their cybersecurity operations, the demand for professionals who understand and can effectively use these tools will soar.\n\nLearning AI not only enhances your productivity but also boosts your career prospects.

We are all longstanding members of the community with day jobs across the three Faculties and the Business School, and we have been in our new roles for several weeks now.\n\nWe consider AI to be emblematic of a deeper level of change within our professional and personal lives. When several of us first began our careers, the internet was a tool embedded across daily life in a way that few thought could be substantially 'bettered'. Then came along social media and smart devices which provide us with significant access to information but can whittle away our time management skills and attention spans. Fast forward a decade, and we now find how we run our offices, our teaching activity, and our homes to be changed beyond recognition in positive and challenging ways. As AI Futurists, we want to support colleagues and students navigate another wave of change, and perhaps apply their approach toward other changes in education, employment, and wider society. Our curiosity in exploring AI very much feels shaped by our individual experiences of Imperial as a community that is open to innovation and positive change.\n\nSo, let us introduce ourselves...\n\nCaroline Clewley is currently the lead of the I-Explore programme and project lead of ImpVis - a staff-student project creating interactive visualisations for STEM courses. She has long aimed to enable students to experience meaningful extra-curricular activities, and this is reflected in her role as the Futurist who will be working across the entire university.\n\nJay DesLauriers is the AI Futurist of the Business School, currently working as a Teaching Fellow in the Graduate School, within the Research Computing and Data Science group. He also teaches for the Business School via the 'Applications of R for Finance' module.\n\nRhodri Nelson has been appointed in the Faculty of Engineering and hopes to engage with colleagues in the coming months on what matters most to them as AI becomes more embedded across departments. His research interests include the application of complex and numerical analysis to fluid dynamics, geophysics and other engineering related problems. He's also a senior developer of the Devito Project.\n\nEmma Blyth covers the Faculty of Medicine, a fast-growing area for AI development both in terms of teaching and in its applications in the health service in the UK and overseas. As a senior learning designer, she currently closely with academic colleagues to develop high quality learning experiences. In her Futurist role she will be chairing a Faculty-wide AI discussion group.\n\nKonstantinos Beis represents the Faculty of Natural Sciences - a highly lab-based section of the university, and an area in which AI promises to make great strides in our understanding within the field of life sciences. His lab group is interested in determining the structure and function of proteins to support society to understand drug resistance more fully.\n\nCoco Nijhoff leads the AI Futurists' overarching objectives, facilitating discussions and communicating the work of the group to the wider College AI Working Party. She is normally responsible for the strategic development and management of Library Services' Information and Digital Literacy programmes, in alignment with the university's Learning and Teaching Strategy. Coco has produced an Information and Digital Literacy framework to incorporate generative AI, which will form the basis of the library's teaching activities across Imperial.\n\nWe hope to meet colleagues across the university in the coming weeks and months. If you see us around campuses, do say hello. We will be more visible across Imperial from the beginning of the next academic year. In the meantime, we are keen to remind education staff and students that online resources and primers are readily available to browse over the summer.\n\nBy Gordon Short\n\nCategorised under Uncategorized", "source": {"uri": "blogs.imperial.ac.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Imperial people"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gordon_short@blogs.imperial.ac.uk", "name": "Gordon Short", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Futurism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visualization_(graphics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Visualization (graphics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Modular programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fellow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Numerical analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fluid dynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Faculty (division)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://blogs.imperial.ac.uk/imperial-people/files/2024/07/IMPERIAL-COLLEGE-AI-FUTURES-GROUP-17.07.2024-crop-1-1024x683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

However, in the future, data will emerge as a critical element in digital transformation, gaining increasing importance among enterprises. Consequently, Kingdee is committed to nurturing new quality productive forces to support high-quality corporate development,\" Xu said.\n\nKingdee, which has been offering management software and services for companies for over three decades, is focusing on its \"subscription priority, AI priority\" strategy this year to help enterprises accelerate their digital transformation, he said.\n\nXu said that the key to developing a digital economy lies in driving enterprises' digital transformation. This involves utilizing new technologies and concepts to develop next-generation enterprise management digital platforms, thereby enhancing enterprise business capability. This encompasses data-driven business operations, customer service and engagement, partner empowerment, asset management and employee enablement.\n\nXu's remarks were echoed by Kitty Fok, managing director of International Data Corp China.\n\nFok said China's digital transformation was mainly focused on the consumer level in the past, such as mobile payments, e-commerce and video-streaming platforms.\n\nThis means there is huge potential for companies in the country to accomplish their digital upgrade as a whole.\n\nIDC has forecast that 51 percent of global IT budgets will go toward digital innovation and digital transformation by 2024, while that number in China is estimated to be above 70 percent.\n\nSpecifically, China's investment in AI is forecast to reach 273.9 billion yuan ($38.1 billion) in 2027, accounting for 9 percent of the world's total, IDC said.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China's top industry regulator, has also said that it would launch an \"AI plus\" initiative to promote the application of the technology in more sectors.\n\nThat would spell significant opportunities for companies like Kingdee.\n\n\"In the realm of financial management, AI has revolutionized the traditional framework, and the shift from experience-based forecasting to AI-precise forecasting represents a significant change,\" Xu said.\n\nAccording to him, while traditional methods rely on subjective experience and limited data, AI integrates big data correlation analysis and deep learning, enabling more accurate revenue, cost, profit and risk predictions. This adaptability to changing environments and needs exemplifies the profound impact of AI.\n\nMoreover, the scope of expert service management has expanded from relying on individual experts to utilizing AI \"teams\". In specialized areas such as taxation, treasury and capital operations, AI can now provide cross-industry, multiskilled solutions, akin to having numerous experts at one's disposal, Xu added.\n\nFor instance, Kingdee said its collaboration with a bank employs multi-feature recall and financial model technology to automatically screen transaction data daily, aiding enterprises in preventing fraudulent trade risks.\n\n\"The introduction of AI also transforms workforce dynamics. A finance department originally staffed with 500 employees can now achieve the output of 1,000 people, with AI significantly enhancing productivity. Conversely, AI can maintain the department's capabilities even if the workforce is reduced to 200, showcasing its value,\" Xu said.\n\nIn May 2024, Kingdee launched its intelligent AI management assistant, Cosmic, and upgraded its Kingdee Cloud Cosmic platform into a new-generation enterprise-level AI platform. Notable collaborations include Chinese property developer C&D Real Estate Corp Ltd, which has partnered with Kingdee to develop a contract management system powered by AI, marking a big boost in work efficiency.\n\nSimilarly, Hisense Group and Kingdee co-created AI applications in human resources management.\n\nAs of March 31, Kingdee International reported an annual recurring revenue of about 2.98 billion yuan from cloud subscription services, a 28 percent year-on-year increase.\n\nIn the first half, Kingdee secured contracts with large enterprises, including China National Petroleum Corp, China National Aviation Holding Corp, Dongfeng Motor Corp, and Longfor Group.\n\nThe progress is the result of Kingdee's long-term emphasis on research and development. In 2023, Kingdee's R&D expenditure was approximately 1.44 billion yuan, accounting for about 25.4 percent of the group's total revenue.\n\n\"The goal is to enhance the digital management value of Chinese enterprises. By empowering our entire product line with AI, Kingdee aims for disruptive innovation, ensuring that every user benefits from an AI assistant,\" Xu said.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kingdee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productive_forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Productive forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Data_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Data Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Correlation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Industry_and_Information_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Industry and Information Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subjectivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renminbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asset management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongfeng_Motor_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dongfeng Motor Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisense", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hisense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Petroleum_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China National Petroleum Corporation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business", "label": "dmoz/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202407/19/6699c505a31095c551b56b20.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737001", "eventUri": "eng-9737001", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-31", "textStart": 4393, "textEnd": 4401}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 85, "relevance": 1}

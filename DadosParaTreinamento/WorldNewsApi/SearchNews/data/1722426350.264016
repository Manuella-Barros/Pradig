The building which houses several government offices, including the Ministry of Lands\u2019 Land Registry and the Government Contracting Unit under the Office of the President and Cabinet, became the focal point of an investigation. ACB acting director general Hilary Chilomba disclosed that the bureau is pursuing cases related to the fire incident. He spoke in an interview in Lilongwe on Thursday on the sidelines of a public lecture he presented at Natural Resources College (NRC) titled \u2018Corruption in the Land Sector\u2019. Said Chilomba: \u201cThat fire was deliberate and the people tried to conceal evidence. There are some cases we are pursuing of some people who own property like houses and they wanted to destroy evidence at the Lands Registry. But we still have the electronic records of all the information so we will still get the culprits.\u201d While the acting DG did not disclose the identities of the suspects and the status of the investigations, he said the graft- busting body is closing in on the suspects. The fire primarily impacted the sixth and seventh floors of the building. In his public lecture, Chilomba acknowledged that corruption is plaguing the country\u2019s land administration and stressed the urgent need to address the issue. He revealed that there are numerous corruption-related files on his desk, underscoring the gravity of the problem. He said: \u201cThe system is marred with corruption, as aspiring land officers, you must be aware of the dangers posed by corrupt practices.\u201d In his remarks, acting director of NRC, a second campus of Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources Patsani Kumambala said 256 students are pursuing a diploma in land administration and 34 aspiring land registrars are set to complete their courses next week.

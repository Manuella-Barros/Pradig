The event, organized by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), focused on re-orienting vendors on hygiene, food safety, and waste management practices. Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Anupriya Patel also attended, according to a press release from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.\n\nThe one-day training covered crucial areas such as personal hygiene, cooking practices, and waste management for vendors from various parts of Delhi. The training heavily referenced the Food Safety and Standards Act's Schedule 4, which details licensing and registration guidelines for food businesses. JP Nadda highlighted the importance of continuous education for vendors and urged them to leverage the PM Street Vendor's AtmaNirbhar Nidhi (PM-SVANidhi) scheme to boost their businesses. He also reaffirmed the Prime Minister's commitment to developing 100 street food streets across different districts.\n\nIn a significant move to encourage more street food vendors to register, Nadda announced that FSSAI would waive the Rs 100 registration fee. He also recommended providing the 'Street Safe' Rapid Testing Kit to attendees of the Food Safety and Certification (FoSTaC) training. Nadda emphasized the integration of street vendors onto food delivery platforms and urged these platforms to support vendors by offering user-friendly technology solutions without added financial strain. He noted that applying the training in daily operations could significantly enhance vendor growth and consumer trust, which would be bolstered further by FSSAI-issued certificates.\n\nAdditionally, Nadda unveiled an 'SOP for Street Food Vendors,' which outlines essential dos and don'ts for maintaining hygiene and safety. A dedicated portal for vendors to share success stories and access resources was also launched. Testimonials from trained vendors highlighted the training program's transformative effects, underscoring its importance in enhancing food safety.\n\nDuring the event, a video focusing on the proper use of oil, milk, and waste disposal was released. Vendors were also provided with kits for instant adulteration testing, empowering them to maintain quality standards. Anupriya Patel reiterated the cultural significance of street food in India and the government's commitment to maintaining high standards of hygiene and cleanliness. She stressed the necessity of regular food testing to ensure a safe and hygienic street food ecosystem nationwide.\n\nThe program also featured a walkthrough of FSSAI's 'Food Safety on Wheels' vehicle, equipped for on-the-go testing of items like oil and milk. According to Union Health Secretary Apurva Chandra, FSSAI aims to train one lakh street food vendors in the next year via the FoSTaC program, aiming to enhance food safety standards and public health across the nation. The initiative builds on FSSAI's success of training over 18 lakh food handlers since 2017, marking a significant step towards improved food safety in India.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_and_Family_Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health and Family Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Safety_and_Standards_Authority_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food Safety and Standards Authority of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Street food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Waste management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Nadda", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

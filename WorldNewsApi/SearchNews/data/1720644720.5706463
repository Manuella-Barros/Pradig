Front High food inflation, RBI retains rate at 6.5%; ups FY25 GDP forecast to 7.2% UPSC Syllabus: Preliminary Examination: Economy Mains Examination: GS-III: Economy What\u2019s the ongoing story- The Reserve Bank of India Friday left the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent on concerns over the rise in food inflation, and revised upwards the real gross domestic product (GDP) growth projection for 2024-25 to 7.2 percent. Prerequisites: \u2014 What is a repo rate? \u2014 What is the consumer price index (CPI) headline inflation? \u2014 What is the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)? \u2014 What is disinflation? Key takeaways: \u2014 The central bank retained the FY25 consumer price index based inflation (CPI) projection at 4.5 per cent but indicated that it will fall below 4 per cent during the July-September quarter. \u2014 The policy panel kept the repo rate unchanged in a 4:2 majority decision as inflation remains above the 4 per cent target. India\u2019s retail inflation rate was 4.83 per cent in April 2024, down from 4.85 per cent in March 2024. The overall tone of the policy remained cautious with upside risk to food inflation from current heat wave conditions. For Your Information: From Explained section: \u2014 The repo rate is the interest rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks. When RBI wants to incentivise economic activity in the broader economy, it reduces the repo rate, which makes it cheaper for banks to borrow from it and lend onwards to customers. \u2014 When it wants to disincentivise economic activity, it raises the repo rate, which makes it costly for everyone in the economy to borrow money. \u2014 The primary objective of the RBI\u2019s monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth. Price stability is a necessary precondition to sustainable growth. \u2014 By law, the RBI is required to target an inflation rate of 4%, which means that the general price level should go up by 4% from one year to another. Research suggests that this is the sweet spot where producers have an incentive to produce (and earn more) without being a huge disincentive for consumers (for whom inflation reduces purchasing power). Points to Ponder: \u2014 What does the RBI use the various tools to control inflation? \u2014 What is the inflation target? \u2014 What is the composition of the MPC? \u2014 Why does the government care about the inflation? Post Read Question: With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements: (UPSC CSE 2022) 1. If the inflation is too high, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to buy government securities. 2. If the rupee is rapidly depreciating, RBI is likely to sell dollars in the market. 3. If interest rates in the USA or European Union were to fall, that is likely to induce RBI to buy dollars. Which of the statements given above are correct?

Explained Central Hall: Where Modi addressed NDA, historic venue in Parliament UPSC Syllabus: Preliminary Examination: History of India Mains Examination: GS-I: Indian Heritage and Culture What\u2019s the ongoing story- Three days after the 2024 Lok Sabha election results, in a meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on Friday (June 7), Prime Minister Narendra Modi was unanimously elected as the coalition\u2019s Parliamentary Party leader. The event took place at the Central Hall of the old Parliament building. Prerequisites: \u2014 Recent election verdict \u2014 Location of the Parliamentary building complex Key takeaways: \u2014 The circular Central Hall, topped by a dome 98 feet in diameter, has witnessed several historical events since it was established in 1927, \u2014 The Parliament House Complex in the heart of New Delhi contains several buildings: the new Parliament House that was opened last year; the old Parliament House, the iconic circular building that has now been renamed as Constitution House; Parliament House Annexe; and the Parliament Library Building. \u2014 The Speaker of Lok Sabha is the custodian of the Parliament House Complex. Political parties and groups are allocated office space inside the complex. \u2014 Central Hall was originally used as the library for the members of the legislature. \u2014 In 1946, when the Constituent Assembly needed a space to meet to deliberate on the Constitution of independent India, Central Hall was refurbished and benches were added \u2014 its name was changed to Constituent Assembly Hall. The Constituent Assembly met at this venue for about three years between 1946 and 1949. \u2014 It was primarily used for formal occasions such as the annual President\u2019s Address to Members of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and swearing-in ceremony of the President. It was also the venue for farewells of the President, and Parliamentary events like the outstanding Parliamentarian award ceremony. For your information: \u2014 The new Parliament building was inaugurated on May 28, 2023. It is designed by Ahmedabad-based HCP Design, Planning and Management under architect Bimal Patel. \u2014 The new Parliament building has three storeys and a built-up area of 64,500 sqm. The Lok Sabha chamber will have 888 seats, up from the existing 543, with the option of expanded seating up to 1,272. The Lok Sabha will be used for joint sittings of both Houses in the absence of a Central Hall, which was the fulcrum of the old building.

It is a classic case study of how the often mundane agendas of education and employment for the young can become surprising centrepieces of politics.\u201d Prerequisites: \u2014 Recent instances of paper leaks \u2014 What are the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) 2024? Key takeaways: \u2014 \u201cExam paper leaks and scams in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Bihar, among other states, have been a key concern for young voters in the age group of 18-25.\u201d \u2014 \u201cAn investigation by The Indian Express (\u2018The big all India exam leak\u2019, February 6) bears this out as 41 paper leaks over the last five years in 15 states affected 1.4 crore job seekers who had applied for over one lakh vacancies.\u201d \u2014 \u201cIn UP itself, three major competitive exams for government jobs were hit by question paper leaks in 2024. The latest in this list was the UP police constable recruitment exam in February, in which over 48 lakh candidates appeared.\u201d \u2014 \u201cFor each paper leak scandal, the question to be asked is: What must be the compensation for years of labour, exorbitant financial cost, and the emotional toll incurred by lakhs of candidates who pin all their hopes on the exam? Beneath this question is also the fatigue of reappearing for the exams and the fear of a new generation of aspirants joining the queue as exams get cancelled.\u201d \u2014 Even after passing the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) 2024, the government ought to ask whether deploying special task forces to investigate the organised use of unfair means in examinations is constructive.\u201d Points to Ponder: \u2014 What are the issues related to the paper leak in India? \u2014 What are the provisions of the new Public Examination Bill? \u2014 What is the impact of the paper leak on the mental health of the aspirants? Post Read Question: The inaction and lack of appropriate measures to curb the leaks are compounded by anxiety and disappointment among youth. Discuss.

A Woman\u2019s Place UPSC Syllabus: Preliminary Examination: Polity Mains Examination: GS-II: Polity and Governance What\u2019s the ongoing story- In September last year, when the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill was passed in Parliament, it raised hopes of a more gender-equal legislature. Prerequisites: \u2014 What is the status of women\u2019s representation in the Parliament? \u2014 What is the Women\u2019s Reservation Act? Key takeaways: \u2014 The near-unanimous support for a Bill that promised 33 percent reservation to women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies\u2026Yet, eight months on, with the 18th Lok Sabha set to convene for its first session in a few weeks, the number of women in the lower House has dropped, from 78 out of 543 (an all-time high) in the 17th Lok Sabha to 73. \u2014 In the recent elections too, while the number of women who turned out to vote saw a dip in some phases, the overall gender gap was almost non-existent, with both male and female voter turnout pegged at about 66 percent by the Election Commission. \u2014 Women have used the power that comes with their participation to shape electoral outcomes, with even political parties recognising the growing importance of the \u201cwoman vote\u201d \u2014 In West Bengal, for instance, the popularity of women-centric schemes such as Lakshmir Bhandar, a monthly cash transfer to over 2 crore women, is believed to have helped in sustaining the dominance of the ruling TMC. Earlier, the impact of Laadli Behna was seen to play a role in the BJP\u2019s return to power in the Madhya Pradesh assembly polls. \u2014 Countries like Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands, with the highest female political representation, employ other kinds of affirmative action; parties in Sweden, for example, use the \u201czipper system\u201d, wherein candidate lists alternate between male and female candidates. \u2014 For India, the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill is neither the beginning nor the end of the road to gender parity in politics \u2014 it is one milestone among many more to come. For Your Information: \u2014 India has elected 74 women MPs to Lok Sabha this year, four fewer than in 2019 and 52 more than in India\u2019s first elections in 1952. These 74 women make just 13.63% of the elected strength of the Lower House, much less than the 33% that will be reserved for women after the next delimitation exercise. Points to Ponder: \u2014 What are the reasons for low women representation in the Lok Sabha? \u2014 What is the significance of increased women representation in the Lok Sabha? \u2014 What initiatives have been taken been by the government to increase women participation in the Parliament? Post Read Question: Which of the following constitutional amendments reserved one-third of all seats for women in Lok Sabha and State legislative assemblies?

Prerequisites: \u2014 What is the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES)? \u2014 What is the need for HCES? Key takeaways: \u2014 In rural areas among all major states, the households of Haryana spent the maximum on \u2018milk and milk products\u2019 at 41.7 percent as a percentage of total expenditure on food, while Kerala spent the most on \u2018egg, fish & meat\u2019 at 23.5 percent. For Your Information: \u2014 The factsheet of the HCES survey report released earlier in February had shown that rural average monthly consumption spending per person increased to Rs 3,773 per month in 2022-23 from Rs 1,430 per person in 2011-12, a jump of 164 percent. \u2014 This is higher than the 146 percent increase in urban average monthly consumption expenditure per person to Rs 6,459 in 2022-23 compared with Rs 2,630 per person in 2011-12. \u2014 In rural India, food accounted for about 46 percent of the households\u2019 consumption spending. In urban India, the share of food in average monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) in 2022-23 was about 39 percent. \u2014 Among non-food items, households spent the most on conveyance in both rural and urban areas of almost all the major states. Points to Ponder: \u2014 What is the significance of HCES? \u2014 What is the impact of inflation on the Household consumption expenditure? Post Read Question: Consider the following statements: 1.

Prerequisites: \u2014 What is the internationalisation of the Indian rupee (INR)? \u2014 What is the capital account? \u2014 What is e-Rupee? \u2014 What is the Capital account convertibility? Key takeaways: \u2014 The central bank has proposed enabling availability of the rupee to non-residents for facilitating cross-border transactions in the rupee and enhancing accessibility of rupee accounts to persons resident outside India (PROIs). \u2014 India has not yet opened up its capital account fully which will allow free flow of capital to the country and outside. The rupee was made full float in the trade account during the 1991 reforms initiated by the then government. \u2014 Meanwhile, on deepening and universalisation of Digital payment systems domestically and globally, the RBI\u2019s agenda includes plans for the internationalisation of India\u2019s Payment Systems (UPI, RTGS and NEFT) and participation in payment systems linkage projects across countries \u2013 bilateral and multilateral. It has planned to increase the domestic usage of digital payments and phased implementation of Central Bank Digital Currency (e \u2013 Rupee). \u2014 On dealing with climate change, the RBI plans guidance for regulated entities (REs) to stress test their asset portfolio to assess impact of climate change and strengthening payment systems\u2019 resilience to climate risks. For Your Information: \u2014 Capital account convertibility means the freedom to convert rupee into any foreign currency and foreign currency back into rupee for capital account transactions. \u2014 The Tarapore committee had listed several preconditions such as fiscal consolidation, inflation control, low level of non-performing assets, low current account deficit and strengthening of financial markets for achieving capital account liberalisation.

Prerequisites: \u2014 What is the Digital Payment Infrastructure (DPI)? \u2014 What is the domestic payment fraud? \u2014 What is the bulk deposit? Key takeaways: \u2014 To take this initiative forward, the RBI has constituted a committee to examine various aspects of setting up a digital public infrastructure for the platform. The committee is expected to give its recommendations within two months. \u2014 Domestic payment frauds jumped by 70.64 per cent to Rs 2,604 crore during the six-month period ended March 2024 from Rs 1,526 crore in the same period of last year. \u2014 The Reserve Bank has proposed to revise the definition of bulk deposits as \u2018single rupee term deposits of Rs 3 crore and above\u2019 from the current limit of Rs 2 crore and above for commercial banks (excluding RRBs) and small finance banks. \u2014 The RBI has decided to bring UPI Lite within the ambit of the e-mandate framework. \u2014 The Reserve Bank has decided to rationalise existing guidelines on export and import of goods and services in line with the changing dynamics of cross-border trade transactions globally.

UPSC Syllabus: Preliminary Examination: Economy Mains Examination: GS-III: Economy What\u2019s the ongoing story- Josh Felman and Arvind Subramanian write: India\u2019s electoral shock poses a stunning economic puzzle. How is it possible that the electorate chastised rather than handsomely rewarded a leader who has presided over an astonishing economic boom? Prerequisites: \u2014 How is GDP measured in India? \u2014 What is the nominal GDP and Real GDP? \u2014 What is the Wholesale Price Index (WPI)? \u2014 What is K-shaped recovery? \u2014 What are the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)? Key takeaways: \u2014 \u201cWithin the economic community, it is no secret that there are many problems with Indian GDP measurement \u2014 faulty deflators, the failure to deflate inputs and outputs separately, outdated sectoral weights, poor measurement of the large informal sector.\u201d \u2014 \u201cIn the past two years, the nominal and real GDP numbers have been telling two completely different stories. According to the nominal GDP numbers, growth has sharply decelerated from 14.2 per cent to 9.6 per cent. But the real GDP numbers show that growth has surged from 7 to 8.2 per cent. The only way to square these numbers is if broad inflation has completely collapsed, falling to just 1.4 per cent. This seems highly implausible.\u201d \u2014 \u201cSome analysts have argued that the electorate was dissatisfied because the fruits of growth have been shared unequally. In this K-shaped view, government policies enabled the very rich to gain at the expense of the poor.\u201d \u2014 \u201cIn sum, there are only two ways to reconcile the economy and the voting results. We would suggest that growth has not been as dynamic as the official numbers suggest, nor has it been very balanced\u2026As a result, the unskilled people working in the agricultural, informal, and manufacturing sectors \u2014 the bulk of the workforce and voters \u2014 experienced the economy in a way that accords with ground-level reporting: that is, negatively.\u201d Points to Ponder: \u2014 What are the issues with the Production-Linked Incentives (PLI) scheme? \u2014Is there any connection between the government's economic policies and the election verdict? \u2014 What are the concerns with the economic data released by the government? \u2014 What initiatives need to be taken by the government to ensure balanced economic growth? Post Read Question: Which of the following statements correctly describes the K-shaped economic recovery? (a) Some parts of the economy may experience strong growth while others continue to decline. (b) When an economy passes through a recession into recovery and then immediately turns down into another recession. (c) It occurs when, after a steep recession, the economy experiences a slow rate of recovery. (d) It is characterised by a quick and sustained recovery in measures of economic performance after a sharp economic decline Other Important Articles Covering the same topic: Roti dal sabzi and the general election Express Network Heatwave in May warmer than before, worsened by climate change, says report UPSC Syllabus: Preliminary Examination: General issues on Environmental Ecology, and Climate Change \u2013 that do not require subject specialisation. Mains: GS-I, GS-II, GS-III: Important Geophysical Phenomena, Climate Change Environmental Pollution & Degradation, Government Policies & Interventions. What\u2019s the ongoing story- The severe heatwave over North and Central India in late May \u2014 when temperatures neared the 50\u00b0 Celsius mark in Delhi and Rajasthan \u2014 was warmer than past heatwaves and strengthened by human-induced climate change, an analysis by a European Union-funded organisation has said. Prerequisites: \u2014 What is a heatwave? \u2014 What are heatwave conditions in India? \u2014 What are the criteria for declaring a heatwave in India? Key takeaways: \u2014 More than 37 cities in the two regions recorded temperatures above 45\u00b0 C, leading to heat-related illness warnings, said the analysis by ClimaMeter. \u2014 The researchers assessed past and present weather conditions such as atmospheric pressure at the surface, temperature and precipitation. \u2014 The scientists found that heatwaves, such as those that hit India, are now almost 1.5\u00b0 C more intense. Temperatures in parts of Delhi such as Najafgarh, Mungeshpur and Narela were in the range of 47-49\u00b0 C while even central and leafier parts such as Safdarjung recorded temperatures as high as 46\u00b0 C. \u2014 \u201c The findings show a complex interplay between natural variations and climate change, with the latter playing an important role in weather-pattern changes in tropical and subtropical regions \u201cthat may significantly aggravate heatwaves in the near future\u201d. For Your Information: \u2014 According to IMD the favorable conditions for Heatwaves are: (i) Transportation / Prevalence of hot dry air over a region (There should be a region of warm dry air and appropriate flow pattern for transporting hot air over the region). (ii) Absence of moisture in the upper atmosphere (As the presence of moisture restricts the temperature rise). (iii) The sky should be practically cloudless (To allow maximum insulation over the region). (iv) Large amplitude anti-cyclonic flow over the area. Points to Ponder: \u2014 What is the impact of heatwave on health? \u2014 What is the impact of heatwave on food security? \u2014 How is climate change aggravating the heatwave situation in the world? \u2014 What needs to be done to reduce the impact of the heatwave? Post Read Question: Prelims The scientific view is that the increase in global temperature should not exceed 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial level.

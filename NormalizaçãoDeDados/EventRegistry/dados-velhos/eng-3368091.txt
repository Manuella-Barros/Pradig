Masoud Barzani, the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s de facto president (his term expired two years ago but he refused to step down), has written that the referendum will be binding.\n\nThere is little mystery to the outcome: Kurds will vote overwhelmingly in favor of independence. A state of their own has long been a dream for Kurds who feel they were unfairly denied independence in the wake of World War I. During a previous, non-binding referendum in 2005, almost 99% of Kurds voted in favor of independence.\n\nDiversion rather than national aspiration, however, may motivate Barzani. He has presided not only over Iraqi Kurdistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boom but also its bust. The region is over $20 billion in debt, its democracy is a distant memory, political patronage trumps merit, and young Kurds are suffocating within a culture of corruption. Court journalists and access-seeking academics focus more on covering up problems than resolving them.\n\nIn Kurdistan Rising , I examined the issues facing each region of Kurdistan and the obstacles they must overcome post-independence to avoid a quick descent into state failure. With Iraqi Kurdistan, economic, diplomatic, and military obstacles all remain. In short, Kurdistan will be born heavily indebted with borders disputed and with a military lacking both unity and major capacities such as air defense.\n\nGiven the obstacles Kurds face, what can they expect the day after they vote for independence?\n\nThe referendum attaches no timeline to independence despite Barzani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s declaration that the results will be binding. Barzani is telling different audiences different things. While he promises Kurds independence, he tells diplomats that he wants only to bolster his negotiating position vis-\u0102 -vis Baghdad and independence will be a subject for an indistinct, undefined horizon measured less in weeks and months and more in years if not decades. That said, the independence drive unleashed by a referendum win will have a momentum of its own. Barzani may not be able to control subsequent events should he wish to retain any political legitimacy.\n\nWhat will the United States do?\n\nThe US Government officially opposes the referendum. While the United States would ultimately adjust to any new status quo, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) is deceiving itself if it believes Washington would re-engage further in the region to come to Kurdistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense. Erbil is caught in a feed-back loop of its own making when the greatest American advocates for its independence and its chief interlocutors are on its payroll either directly or indirectly via large business contracts. Nor would international oil companies lobby effectively on Kurdistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf. The KRG has both burned too many bridges with its graft to expect oil companies to lobby for a promise in which they no longer believe and, regardless, when oil interests look at their balance sheet, Kurdistan compares poorly to the rump Iraqi state. Iraq would both be richer in oil resources and it would not suffer the logistical headaches of being landlocked.\n\nWhat will Iran do?\n\nThe real problem Kurdistan will face the day after its referendum, however, is Iran. The Iranian government has long opposed any Kurdish independence in Iraq, largely because they fear how the precedent might impact the Kurdish population in Iran. In 2015, Iranian authorities sent a subtle warning to Barzani when a note-taker for an Iranian delegation meeting the Kurdish leader was a triggerman in the 1989 Vienna assassination of Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou, the leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran. Last month, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Major-General Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff for the Iranian Armed Forces, told assembled IRGC leaders that the referendum \u00e2\u0080\u009cis the beginning of the crisis and the new challenges in the region\u00e2\u0080\u009d and called the vote \u00e2\u0080\u009cunacceptable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi doubled down on Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s official opposition, stating, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIran calls for territorial integrity and territorial unity in Iraq, and we see the referendum at the expense of peace and stability in the region. This will trigger third-party agents and instability in the region and will not benefit anyone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The same day, Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Supreme National Security Council warned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlthough this issue might be attractive in appearance but actually, it will isolate and pressure the Iraqi Kurds and weaken Kurdistan and finally the entire Iraq.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIf Kurdistan becomes independent or even appears on the path to do so, expect Iran to undermine actively any chance for its success. Because Iraqi Kurds are so divided, the Iranian government can utilize the greed of some Iraqi politicians and the fear of others to compel fealty as Tehran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proxies. Indeed, Iranian cooption of Jalal Talabani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eldest son Bafil [Pavel] in an operation that compromised American contractors led to his temporary exile to London. Playing the energy card\u00e2\u0080\"providing electricity to regions controlled by some factions while denying it to others \u00e2\u0080\" is another tactic Iran can try. Tehran will likely also exploit divisions within the Barzani family, especially as Kurdistan drifts toward a Syrian-style hereditary republic: Imagine Turkey backing Masoud Barzani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eldest son Masrour while nephew Nechirvan Barzani becomes Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tool. The IRGC can also perpetrate violence \u00e2\u0080\" bombings, assassinations, and kidnappings \u00e2\u0080\" on its own. Iraqi Kurdistan is just as deeply penetrated by Iranian security services as southern Iraq, and the inflated sense of security which many Western diplomats, aid workers and businessmen have in Erbil and Sulaymani make them vulnerable. After the referendum, expect the targeting of Westerners in Erbil in addition to assassinations of key members of the Barzani family.\n\nWhat will Turkey do?\n\nIn the run-up to the 2003 US invasion of Iraq and its immediate aftermath, the biggest fear among policymakers focused on Kurdistan was Turkish interference or even a Turkish invasion. Turkish intelligence sponsored the Iraqi Turkmen Front, a group which had little popular support but which claimed to represent millions. The Turkish decision not to participate or even allow free passage for US forces relieved Kurdish fears that Turkey might enter their territory as part of the coalition. The unfulfilled Turkish demand to open a second border crossing with Iraqi Kurdistan to facilitate US resupply (for which Gen. David Petraeus lobbied and to which Nechirvan Barzani had quietly acquiesced) was all about Turkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to cut Iraqi Kurdistan off from its outlet to Syria. Numerous journalists and diplomats argued Kurdish control of Kirkuk could be a flashpoint precipitating a Turkish invasion. Turkey not only shared Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concern that a politically autonomous or independent Kurdistan could be a precedent to undermine its own territorial integrity, but also feared that Iraqi Kurdistan could become a safe haven for Kurdish insurgents or terrorists fighting inside Turkey.\n\nThat has changed over the years. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Masoud Barzani have become more partners than adversaries as Turkish businesses have flooded into Iraqi Kurdistan, often taking Barzanis as their business partners. In addition, Iraqi Kurdistan relies on pipelines through Turkey to export its oil. Here, both Erdogan and Barzani may personally benefit, as a discrepancy between metered and declared results suggest diversion after the fact of some oil.\n\nWhat this means is while Ankara officially opposes Kurdish independence, Turkey feels that they can tolerate the result so long as they dominate the resulting entity. In short, an independent Iraqi Kurdistan might become the equivalent of Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, that is, more a colony of Turkey than a truly independent state.\n\nWhat will Iraq do?\n\nWhile the Iraqi government officially opposes Kurdish independence, a generation of Iraqis has become accustomed to Iraqi Kurdistan as its own separate entity and, frankly, may not care much should the provinces of Erbil, Sulaymani, and Duhok go their own way. But two disputes loom which will trump a smooth separation: First is Barzani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to hold the referendum in disputed territories\u00e2\u0080\"Kirkuk, Sinjar, other districts around Mosul, as well as in the Diyala governorate\u00e2\u0080\"a move which guarantees disputed borders.\n\nSecond is financial. Iraqi Kurdistan in theory receives 17% of Iraq\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oil income. KRG coffers have received less, however, because of disputes about whether Kurdish oil should be counted in the totals from which the 17% is calculated, or whether it should be in addition to the 17%. Erbil would certainly demand money it believe it is owed. The problem is that Baghdad feels Erbil actually owes it money. There was the Kurdish looting of Iraqi banks, for example. The KRG stole about five trillion Iraqi dinars post-2014, monies which the KRG has already agreed to deduct from its budget to repay the bank. More importantly, Iraq is more than $60 billion in debt. Iraqi politicians say that the price of Kurdish separation should be, at a minimum, 17% of that debt, or $10.2 billion, a significant amount added to the KRG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing $20 billion debt.\n\nBoth issues are intractable; months and years of negotiation between Erbil and Baghdad will not solve them. This makes it likely that the Kurdish divorce from Iraq will be more akin to Sudan and South Sudan; Ethiopia and Eritrea; or Serbia and Kosovo rather than the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nSecond, after Saddam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fall, Kurdish leaders chose to work in Baghdad instead of limiting themselves to Iraqi Kurdistan. They did this for their own security: if they were part of Iraqi politics, they could mitigate the risk. If Kurdish officials vote in a referendum to separate from Iraq or even if their parties do, it is also likely that populist Iraqi politicians will demand they resign their posts. While Kurds are underrepresented in Prime Minister Haydar al-Abadi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cabinet, Iraq\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president is Kurdish as are many senior technocrats and diplomats. The central Iraqi government may soon become an unwelcome place for any follower of Barzani and perhaps Talabani as well.\n\nSo, in short, where does this leave Iraqi Kurdistan? Kurds have a dream and they are loathe to allow non-Kurdish naysayers to deny them the best opportunity in a century for statehood. That said, the more Kurdish populists and those cheerleading for Kurdish national aspirations focus on referendum day to the detriment of what comes next, the shorter the Kurdish honeymoon might become. It is painful to say but, given the problems which Iraqi Kurdish leaders refuse to acknowledge or address, the more likely it is that Iraqi Kurdistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best years might now be behind it.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label":

Hardline politicians and militia leaders have even indicated that the secession might lead to a war with the Kurds.\n\nConsequently, the political situation between Baghdad and Iraqi Kurdistan has been moving implacably towards full-blown conflict with unpredictable consequences. In neighbouring countries, anger is also growing.\n\nTurkey, which had earlier described the referendum as \"irresponsible,\" is now saying it will not tolerate the formation of new \"artificial\" states along its southern border.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Friday that his government would not hesitate \"to respond to any threatening attitude towards our country's sovereign rights, its security, and its interests.\"\n\nIran, which has cracked down on home-grown Kurdish militants and has carried out strikes on Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, has stepped up pressure on the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq to halt the referendum.\n\nMohamed Bagheri, the Iranian army's chief of staff, said the referendum \"is unacceptable to Iraq's neighbours.\" He said maintaining Iraq's independence and territorial integrity was \"in the interests of all.\"\n\nArab League Secretary-General Ahmed Abul-Gheit told Barzani in a letter that the referendum would \"open the door to the winds of fragmentation and splits\" in the Middle East.\n\nEven the Kurds' closest allies are urging them to postpone the vote.\n\nThe US State Department has repeatedly voiced concerns that an independence referendum would be a distraction from \"more urgent priorities,\" such as the defeat of Islamic State (IS) militants.\n\nIn its recent show of unease, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked Barzani to postpone the referendum on independence.\n\nIt is not hard to see why the referendum has been facing opposition from the Baghdad government, Iraq's neighbours and Western nations, but what is more surprising is that opposition to the vote has also risen among the Kurds.\n\nWhile the majority of Kurdish parties have expressed support for the move, others have been vocal in expressing their objections to the referendum.\n\nLast Saturday, the pro-reform Goran Party that won the second-largest number of seats in the now defunct Kurdistan parliament, renewed its opposition to the vote, setting a number of preconditions before it would support the referendum.\n\nThe party, whose name means \"change\" in Kurdish, said that a bid for independence from Iraq was premature. The party said Barzani should not have moved unilaterally before forging a national consensus and reaching an understanding with Baghdad.\n\nIt also wants the Kurdistan parliament, suspended since 2015 after Goran refused to support a second extension of Barzani's term in office, reconvened.\n\nThe suspension of the parliament and the unity government prompted violent protests and political deadlock at the time.\n\nIn recent weeks ordinary Kurds, in particular those in Suleimaniyah, have begun criticising the referendum as an attempt by Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (PUK) to shore up nationalist support and as camouflage to hide its mismanagement in government.\n\nLast week, Kurdish activists launched an unexpected domestic push for a \"no\" vote in the independence referendum. Organisers of the campaign entitled \"No for Now\" believe that the 25 September vote will not serve the interests of Kurdistan's population.\n\nThe region's failing economy is another major challenge to a sovereign Kurdistan. The continued development of the capacities of the Kurdistan economy will depend largely on broad-based economic growth, which in turn depends on stability.\n\nIraqi Kurdistan is also a land-locked region bordered by Turkey, Iran and Syria. Without normal and peaceful relations with its neighbours and Baghdad, Kurdistan will not be able to address its economic challenges and promote development.\n\nAfter years of leadership failure, a patronage system, government mismanagement and corruption, Kurdistan's economy is now in a shambles. If the region were to become independent it could hardly survive economically.\n\nDespite revenues of a 17 per cent share of Iraq's budget and the lucrative sale of oil from fields it has seized from Iraq, the KRG has not been able to pay salaries regularly to government employees for years.\n\nAnother question of contention with Baghdad is the oil-rich province of Kirkuk and huge swathes of territory that Kurdish Peshmergas fighters have seized and declared to be part of Kurdistan.\n\nBy including Kirkuk and these territories in the referendum next month, the KRG has infuriated local Arab, Turkmen and other ethnicities who reject Kurdish claims over them.\n\nMeanwhile, Barzani and the referendum's backers in other parties are sticking to the plan to hold an independence poll on 25 September despite requests to postpone it.\n\nFor its part, Baghdad is not expected to budge on blocking the referendum, and it insists the issue was settled in the post-Saddam constitution that made Kurdistan a federal region within Iraq following the 2003 US-led invasion and the collapse of the regime led by former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein.\n\nHow events now unfold will be unpredictable. Both sides will need to take care not to overreact, in order to avoid tipping the balance of public opinion towards a confrontation.\n\nWhile Iraqi Kurdistan cannot plausibly claim to be a victim of a federal political system its own leaders helped to create after Saddam's fall, the Baghdad government could do much more to persuade the region to stay.\n\nOne thing which it should do is to work to make the system more attractive to the Kurds and promise to hold a constitutional convention that would look again at the distribution of powers agreed on in the 2005 constitution.\n\nA truly democratic, non-sectarian government and a political system based on civic nationhood and shared citizenship is what Iraq needs in order to offer the longer-term hope of bridging ethnic and sectarian divides and defusing communal tensions in the country.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"},

According to reports received, the 'yes' and 'no' ballots prepared in 4 languages, have been sent to print. Despite this, the referendum debate has not waned. Rather than the propaganda activity concerning the referendum, the questions currently debated are whether the referendum is to take place, what the US demand means, what the Gorran Movement (Movement for Change) and KomeleyaIslami would do, how Turkey, Iran and Iraq will approach the issue and whether they will intervene.\n\nThese debates have both external as well as internal causes.\n\nWhile the external causes are important, it is nonetheless useful to scrutinise principally the internal causes and their possible risks, since they are of a quality of compounding the external ones.\n\nThe internal causes include primarily the lack of progress made against ensuring a satisfactory level of conciliation between political parties, the ousting of a party from the government in the manner of a coup, economic issues and unending controversies about corruption.\n\nFor the resolution of issues caused by these controversies, the political parties, particularly Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), have been holding a series of talks.\n\nLast week, Mele Bahtiyar, a PUK executive, had declared that the parliament will be open for business and become fully operational as of 12thor 13th August. Accompanying this was also a statement that talks are to be held between the Gorran Movement and KDP for the resolution of issues. The parliament did not open on the said date. The Gorran Movement and KDP did not make any statement even on the subject of the referendum taking place which will satisfy the elector and strengthen the Kurds' hands.\n\nWhile the expectations were for steps to be taken to resolve all these issues, signs that the Gorran Movement and KomelayaIslami, who protested by not participating the meeting which agreed on the referendum date, are likely to vote 'no' in the referendum have been emerging. Sadi Ahmed Pire, a high-level PUK executive, in a panel discussion organised in Sulaymaniyah earlier this week described the positions of both organisations as \"the Gorran Movement and KomelayaIslami are not against the referendum, they are participating the referendum with a no vote, that is participating the process too.\" To be sure, Sadi Ahmed Pire's words, then, coming from someone who has met both organisations numerous times for the resolution of issues are an important indication as to what the main tendency of each of the organisations is likely to be in the referendum. It is evident that, unless important changes take place or if an issue of the sort of the last-minute postponement of the referendum does not transpire, the Gorran Movement and KomelayaIslami's position in the referendum is likely to be a vote against. Debates include also the possibility of the boycott of the referendum by these two organisations rather than a 'no' vote. There are even reports that a group from within the PUK itself may also boycott.\n\nPut openly, unless measures are taken to resolve the issues and at least a temporary resolution is not ensured in between the parties in the remaining short period of time, the independence referendum will be rendered problematic no matter what the result is. It is possible to say as of now that the result will be 'yes' yet especially in 'the disputed' regions like Sinjar and Kirkuk, a prospective low 'yes' vote will mean the start of serious problems for the Kurds.\n\nAdded to the KDP's 'self-centric' attitude, the presence of a tendency within PUK still hostile to the Gorran movement, its desire to exploit the contradictions between the KDP and Gorran Movement brought about with itself the inability to make progress without first resolving the issues, or put more clearly, without first ensuring conciliation on an issue as serious as the independence referendum. No doubt, had the KDP and PUK so wished it, the decision for the referendum would not have been taken by the agreement only of three parties of the parliament, KDP, PUK and Yekgirtu\u0130slami but, as it is duly should have been, with the decision of all 5 parties with a majority in the Parliament and even through the unanimous decision of all parliamentarians. The encumbering of the process by the KDP and PUK, Gorran Movement's refusal to back down even a little to ensure conciliation did more to add rather than lessen the problems and brought them to where they are now.\n\nIt must be accepted that the situation at the current stage reached is one of risk. Considering especially the existence of so many states in the region such as Turkey, Iran and Iraq who are opposed to the referendum as well as western states such as the US continuing to declare their \"support for the integrity of Iraq,\" ignoring or belittling this risk is not right. The referendum itself is not a declaration of independence, however, all possibilities which weaken Kurds' hands in the aftermath of the referendum places the desired declaration under difficulty.\n\nThere are serious benefits in finding reconciliation in a short period of time, taking into account also the possibilities which will strengthen the hands of Kurds rather than prefer political valour as in the case of KDP and PUK or sacrifice the referendum for one's own subjective interests as with the Gorran Movement. If the estimates are made well, not only will the significance of undertaking an independence referendum but also that of emerging from it with strong results particularly in the 'disputed' regions will be duly discerned.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 100, "id": 277, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Asian", "wgt": 100, "id": 299, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Asian"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc", "id": "106"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "loc", "id": "107"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "loc", "id": "225"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kirkuk"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkuk", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kirkuk"}, "type": "loc", "id": "1558"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "As Sulaym\u0101n\u012byah"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulaymaniyah", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "As Sulaym\u0101n\u012byah"}, "type": "loc", "id": "1589"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sinj\u0101r"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinjar", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sinj\u0101r"}, "type": "loc", "id": "11878"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303036", "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305524", "label": {"eng": "Kurdish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "322328", "label": {"eng": "Kurdistan"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Democratic_Party", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kurdistan Democratic Party"}, "type": "loc", "id": "408949"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotic_Union_of_Kurdistan", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "423358", "label": {"eng": "Patriotic Union of Kurdistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Change", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "678831", "label": {"eng": "Movement for Change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Change_", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "700864", "label": {"eng": "Gorran Movement"}}]}

Masoud Barzani, the region's de facto president (his term expired two years ago but he refused to step down), has written that the referendum will be binding.\n\nThere is little mystery to the outcome: Kurds will vote overwhelmingly in favor of independence. A state of their own has long been a dream for Kurds who feel they were unfairly denied independence in the wake of World War I. During a previous, non-binding referendum in 2005, almost 99% of Kurds voted in favor of independence.\n\nDiversion rather than national aspiration, however, may motivate Barzani. He has presided not only over Iraqi Kurdistan's boom but also its bust. The region is over $20 billion in debt, its democracy is a distant memory, political patronage trumps merit, and young Kurds are suffocating within a culture of corruption. Court journalists and access-seeking academics focus more on covering up problems than resolving them.\n\nIn Kurdistan Rising , I examined the issues facing each region of Kurdistan and the obstacles they must overcome post-independence to avoid a quick descent into state failure. With Iraqi Kurdistan, economic, diplomatic, and military obstacles all remain. In short, Kurdistan will be born heavily indebted with borders disputed and with a military lacking both unity and major capacities such as air defense.\n\nGiven the obstacles Kurds face, what can they expect the day after they vote for independence?\n\nThe referendum attaches no timeline to independence despite Barzani's declaration that the results will be binding. Barzani is telling different audiences different things. While he promises Kurds independence, he tells diplomats that he wants only to bolster his negotiating position vis-\u00e0-vis Baghdad and independence will be a subject for an indistinct, undefined horizon measured less in weeks and months and more in years if not decades. That said, the independence drive unleashed by a referendum win will have a momentum of its own. Barzani may not be able to control subsequent events should he wish to retain any political legitimacy.\n\nWhat will the United States do?\n\nThe US Government officially opposes the referendum. While the United States would ultimately adjust to any new status quo, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) is deceiving itself if it believes Washington would re-engage further in the region to come to Kurdistan's defense. Erbil is caught in a feed-back loop of its own making when the greatest American advocates for its independence and its chief interlocutors are on its payroll either directly or indirectly via large business contracts. Nor would international oil companies lobby effectively on Kurdistan's behalf. The KRG has both burned too many bridges with its graft to expect oil companies to lobby for a promise in which they no longer believe and, regardless, when oil interests look at their balance sheet, Kurdistan compares poorly to the rump Iraqi state. Iraq would both be richer in oil resources and it would not suffer the logistical headaches of being landlocked.\n\nWhat will Iran do?\n\nThe real problem Kurdistan will face the day after its referendum, however, is Iran. The Iranian government has long opposed any Kurdish independence in Iraq, largely because they fear how the precedent might impact the Kurdish population in Iran. In 2015, Iranian authorities sent a subtle warning to Barzani when a note-taker for an Iranian delegation meeting the Kurdish leader was a triggerman in the 1989 Vienna assassination of Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou, the leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran. Last month, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Major-General Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff for the Iranian Armed Forces, told assembled IRGC leaders that the referendum \"is the beginning of the crisis and the new challenges in the region\" and called the vote \"unacceptable.\" Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi doubled down on Iran's official opposition, stating, \"Iran calls for territorial integrity and territorial unity in Iraq, and we see the referendum at the expense of peace and stability in the region. This will trigger third-party agents and instability in the region and will not benefit anyone.\" The same day, Iran's Supreme National Security Council warned, \"Although this issue might be attractive in appearance but actually, it will isolate and pressure the Iraqi Kurds and weaken Kurdistan and finally the entire Iraq.\"\n\nIf Kurdistan becomes independent or even appears on the path to do so, expect Iran to undermine actively any chance for its success. Because Iraqi Kurds are so divided, the Iranian government can utilize the greed of some Iraqi politicians and the fear of others to compel fealty as Tehran's proxies. Indeed, Iranian cooption of Jalal Talabani's eldest son Bafil [Pavel] in an operation that compromised American contractors led to his temporary exile to London. Playing the energy card -- providing electricity to regions controlled by some factions while denying it to others -- is another tactic Iran can try. Tehran will likely also exploit divisions within the Barzani family, especially as Kurdistan drifts toward a Syrian-style hereditary republic: Imagine Turkey backing Masoud Barzani's eldest son Masrour while nephew Nechirvan Barzani becomes Iran's tool. The IRGC can also perpetrate violence -- bombings, assassinations, and kidnappings -- on its own. Iraqi Kurdistan is just as deeply penetrated by Iranian security services as southern Iraq, and the inflated sense of security which many Western diplomats, aid workers and businessmen have in Erbil and Sulaymani make them vulnerable. After the referendum, expect the targeting of Westerners in Erbil in addition to assassinations of key members of the Barzani family.\n\nWhat will Turkey do?\n\nIn the run-up to the 2003 US invasion of Iraq and its immediate aftermath, the biggest fear among policymakers focused on Kurdistan was Turkish interference or even a Turkish invasion. Turkish intelligence sponsored the Iraqi Turkmen Front, a group which had little popular support but which claimed to represent millions. The Turkish decision not to participate or even allow free passage for US forces relieved Kurdish fears that Turkey might enter their territory as part of the coalition. The unfulfilled Turkish demand to open a second border crossing with Iraqi Kurdistan to facilitate US resupply (for which Gen. David Petraeus lobbied and to which Nechirvan Barzani had quietly acquiesced) was all about Turkey's ability to cut Iraqi Kurdistan off from its outlet to Syria. Numerous journalists and diplomats argued Kurdish control of Kirkuk could be a flashpoint precipitating a Turkish invasion. Turkey not only shared Iran's concern that a politically autonomous or independent Kurdistan could be a precedent to undermine its own territorial integrity, but also feared that Iraqi Kurdistan could become a safe haven for Kurdish insurgents or terrorists fighting inside Turkey.\n\nThat has changed over the years. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Masoud Barzani have become more partners than adversaries as Turkish businesses have flooded into Iraqi Kurdistan, often taking Barzanis as their business partners. In addition, Iraqi Kurdistan relies on pipelines through Turkey to export its oil. Here, both Erdogan and Barzani may personally benefit, as a discrepancy between metered and declared results suggest diversion after the fact of some oil.\n\nWhat this means is while Ankara officially opposes Kurdish independence, Turkey feels that they can tolerate the result so long as they dominate the resulting entity. In short, an independent Iraqi Kurdistan might become the equivalent of Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, that is, more a colony of Turkey than a truly independent state.\n\nWhat will Iraq do?\n\nWhile the Iraqi government officially opposes Kurdish independence, a generation of Iraqis has become accustomed to Iraqi Kurdistan as its own separate entity and, frankly, may not care much should the provinces of Erbil, Sulaymani, and Duhok go their own way. But two disputes loom which will trump a smooth separation: First is Barzani's decision to hold the referendum in disputed territories -- Kirkuk, Sinjar, other districts around Mosul, as well as in the Diyala governorate -- a move which guarantees disputed borders.\n\nSecond is financial. Iraqi Kurdistan in theory receives 17% of Iraq's oil income. KRG coffers have received less, however, because of disputes about whether Kurdish oil should be counted in the totals from which the 17% is calculated, or whether it should be in addition to the 17%. Erbil would certainly demand money it believe it is owed. The problem is that Baghdad feels Erbil actually owes it money. There was the Kurdish looting of Iraqi banks, for example. The KRG stole about five trillion Iraqi dinars post-2014, monies which the KRG has already agreed to deduct from its budget to repay the bank. More importantly, Iraq is more than $60 billion in debt. Iraqi politicians say that the price of Kurdish separation should be, at a minimum, 17% of that debt, or $10.2 billion, a significant amount added to the KRG's existing $20 billion debt.\n\nBoth issues are intractable; months and years of negotiation between Erbil and Baghdad will not solve them. This makes it likely that the Kurdish divorce from Iraq will be more akin to Sudan and South Sudan; Ethiopia and Eritrea; or Serbia and Kosovo rather than the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nSecond, after Saddam's fall, Kurdish leaders chose to work in Baghdad instead of limiting themselves to Iraqi Kurdistan. They did this for their own security: if they were part of Iraqi politics, they could mitigate the risk. If Kurdish officials vote in a referendum to separate from Iraq or even if their parties do, it is also likely that populist Iraqi politicians will demand they resign their posts. While Kurds are underrepresented in Prime Minister Haydar al-Abadi's cabinet, Iraq's president is Kurdish as are many senior technocrats and diplomats. The central Iraqi government may soon become an unwelcome place for any follower of Barzani and perhaps Talabani as well.\n\nSo, in short, where does this leave Iraqi Kurdistan? Kurds have a dream and they are loathe to allow non-Kurdish naysayers to deny them the best opportunity in a century for statehood. That said, the more Kurdish populists and those cheerleading for Kurdish national aspirations focus on referendum day to the detriment of what comes next, the shorter the Kurdish honeymoon might become. It is painful to say but, given the problems which Iraqi Kurdish leaders refuse to acknowledge or address, the more likely it is that Iraqi Kurdistan's best years might now be behind it.", "date":

Masoud Barzani, the region's de facto president (his term expired two years ago but he refused to step down), has written that the referendum will be binding.\n\nThere is little mystery to the outcome: Kurds will vote overwhelmingly in favor of independence. A state of their own has long been a dream for Kurds who feel they were unfairly denied independence in the wake of World War I. During a previous, non-binding referendum in 2005, almost 99% of Kurds voted in favor of independence.\n\nDiversion rather than national aspiration, however, may motivate Barzani. He has presided not only over Iraqi Kurdistan's boom but also its bust. The region is over $20 billion in debt, its democracy is a distant memory, political patronage trumps merit, and young Kurds are suffocating within a culture of corruption. Court journalists and access-seeking academics focus more on covering up problems than resolving them.\n\nIn Kurdistan Rising , I examined the issues facing each region of Kurdistan and the obstacles they must overcome post-independence to avoid a quick descent into state failure. With Iraqi Kurdistan, economic, diplomatic, and military obstacles all remain. In short, Kurdistan will be born heavily indebted with borders disputed and with a military lacking both unity and major capacities such as air defense.\n\nGiven the obstacles Kurds face, what can they expect the day after they vote for independence?\n\nThe referendum attaches no timeline to independence despite Barzani's declaration that the results will be binding. Barzani is telling different audiences different things. While he promises Kurds independence, he tells diplomats that he wants only to bolster his negotiating position vis-\u00e0-vis Baghdad and independence will be a subject for an indistinct, undefined horizon measured less in weeks and months and more in years if not decades. That said, the independence drive unleashed by a referendum win will have a momentum of its own. Barzani may not be able to control subsequent events should he wish to retain any political legitimacy.\n\nWhat will the United States do?\n\nThe US Government officially opposes the referendum. While the United States would ultimately adjust to any new status quo, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) is deceiving itself if it believes Washington would re-engage further in the region to come to Kurdistan's defense. Erbil is caught in a feed-back loop of its own making when the greatest American advocates for its independence and its chief interlocutors are on its payroll either directly or indirectly via large business contracts. Nor would international oil companies lobby effectively on Kurdistan's behalf. The KRG has both burned too many bridges with its graft to expect oil companies to lobby for a promise in which they no longer believe and, regardless, when oil interests look at their balance sheet, Kurdistan compares poorly to the rump Iraqi state. Iraq would both be richer in oil resources and it would not suffer the logistical headaches of being landlocked.\n\nWhat will Iran do?\n\nThe real problem Kurdistan will face the day after its referendum, however, is Iran. The Iranian government has long opposed any Kurdish independence in Iraq, largely because they fear how the precedent might impact the Kurdish population in Iran. In 2015, Iranian authorities sent a subtle warning to Barzani when a note-taker for an Iranian delegation meeting the Kurdish leader was a triggerman in the 1989 Vienna assassination of Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou, the leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran. Last month, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Major-General Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff for the Iranian Armed Forces, told assembled IRGC leaders that the referendum \"is the beginning of the crisis and the new challenges in the region\" and called the vote \"unacceptable.\" Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi doubled down on Iran's official opposition, stating, \"Iran calls for territorial integrity and territorial unity in Iraq, and we see the referendum at the expense of peace and stability in the region. This will trigger third-party agents and instability in the region and will not benefit anyone.\" The same day, Iran's Supreme National Security Council warned, \"Although this issue might be attractive in appearance but actually, it will isolate and pressure the Iraqi Kurds and weaken Kurdistan and finally the entire Iraq.\"\n\nIf Kurdistan becomes independent or even appears on the path to do so, expect Iran to undermine actively any chance for its success. Because Iraqi Kurds are so divided, the Iranian government can utilize the greed of some Iraqi politicians and the fear of others to compel fealty as Tehran's proxies. Indeed, Iranian cooption of Jalal Talabani's eldest son Bafil [Pavel] in an operation that compromised American contractors led to his temporary exile to London. Playing the energy card -- providing electricity to regions controlled by some factions while denying it to others -- is another tactic Iran can try. Tehran will likely also exploit divisions within the Barzani family, especially as Kurdistan drifts toward a Syrian-style hereditary republic: Imagine Turkey backing Masoud Barzani's eldest son Masrour while nephew Nechirvan Barzani becomes Iran's tool. The IRGC can also perpetrate violence -- bombings, assassinations, and kidnappings -- on its own. Iraqi Kurdistan is just as deeply penetrated by Iranian security services as southern Iraq, and the inflated sense of security which many Western diplomats, aid workers and businessmen have in Erbil and Sulaymani make them vulnerable. After the referendum, expect the targeting of Westerners in Erbil in addition to assassinations of key members of the Barzani family.\n\nWhat will Turkey do?\n\nIn the run-up to the 2003 US invasion of Iraq and its immediate aftermath, the biggest fear among policymakers focused on Kurdistan was Turkish interference or even a Turkish invasion. Turkish intelligence sponsored the Iraqi Turkmen Front, a group which had little popular support but which claimed to represent millions. The Turkish decision not to participate or even allow free passage for US forces relieved Kurdish fears that Turkey might enter their territory as part of the coalition. The unfulfilled Turkish demand to open a second border crossing with Iraqi Kurdistan to facilitate US resupply (for which Gen. David Petraeus lobbied and to which Nechirvan Barzani had quietly acquiesced) was all about Turkey's ability to cut Iraqi Kurdistan off from its outlet to Syria. Numerous journalists and diplomats argued Kurdish control of Kirkuk could be a flashpoint precipitating a Turkish invasion. Turkey not only shared Iran's concern that a politically autonomous or independent Kurdistan could be a precedent to undermine its own territorial integrity, but also feared that Iraqi Kurdistan could become a safe haven for Kurdish insurgents or terrorists fighting inside Turkey.\n\nThat has changed over the years. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Masoud Barzani have become more partners than adversaries as Turkish businesses have flooded into Iraqi Kurdistan, often taking Barzanis as their business partners. In addition, Iraqi Kurdistan relies on pipelines through Turkey to export its oil. Here, both Erdogan and Barzani may personally benefit, as a discrepancy between metered and declared results suggest diversion after the fact of some oil.\n\nWhat this means is while Ankara officially opposes Kurdish independence, Turkey feels that they can tolerate the result so long as they dominate the resulting entity.

If we had a problem with Kurds, we would not have such good relations with Kurds in northern Iraq as the Turkish state despite all the criticism against it,\" Kal\u0131n added.\n\nForeign Minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu also said yesterday that Ankara expects the KRG to step back from the independence referendum. \"When [Iraq] has so many problems, an independence referendum would make the current situation worse, up until a civil war, God forbid,\" he claimed.\n\nIn June, KRG President Masoud Barzani announced that they would hold a referendum on independence from Baghdad on Sept. 25.\n\nAnkara has opposed the independence vote, saying that would be a \"grave mistake\" that would \"result in undesired results\" for regional peace and security.\n\nKal\u0131n added that although Turkey has and will continue to have good relations with the Irbil government, he contended the KRG should give up on the referendum, if they do not, there would be consequences.\n\n\"Even if they have a referendum, what will they do with the possible result of independence? Who will recognize their independence? None of the neighboring countries will recognize it. The Europeans and Americans also made their stance on the issue quite clear. That is why they will put themselves in trouble,\" Kal\u0131n said, explaining that the inclusion of Kirkuk in the referendum is another sensitive issue for Ankara. \"The Irbil government does not have the right to do this since Kirkuk is dependent on the Bagdad government. It is a Turkmen city with a Kurdish and Arab population, and the result would be obvious when you include such a city in the referendum,\" he said, contending that neither Turkmens nor Arabs would participate in the referendum.\n\nSpeaking after a Cabinet meeting in Ankara, Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozda\u011f, also the government spokesman, also said on Tuesday that Ankara is against any attempts that pose a threat to peace and stability in the region, including the KRG referendum, which proposes to declare independence from the central government in Baghdad.\n\nSince the KRG announced its plan to hold the referendum, the international community has made many statements about it. However, so far only Israel supports it. The harshest statement against the referendum came from the Iraqi government, claiming that the referendum is not constitutional and would create more problems for the country. The Iraqi central government, Iran and the EU have also said they defend the territorial integrity of Iraq while the U.S. demanded the postponement of the referendum. Russia, on the other hand, has said that although they see the referendum as the result of Kurdish demands, the views of neighboring countries should also be considered on such an important issue.\n\nWith a population of around 5 million people, Iraqi Kurdistan enjoys a high degree of autonomy. It has its own parliament and armed forces, but has clashed with the central administration in Baghdad over distribution of oil revenues and control of some areas under the central Iraqi administration.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id":

Three years, four years ago, actually, the issue of independence and referendum was on the table, but when Daesh came, the priorities changed,\" Safeen Dizayee said.\n\nHe added that the lack of help from Baghdad during Kurdistan's attempts to counter the negative impact of Daesh activities led to the increased interest in referendum.\n\nBaghdad has sharply criticized Kurdistan's plan to hold the referendum, with Vice President Nouri Maliki saying secession would be unconstitutional. The US State Department has objected to the timing of the referendum, saying that it would divert the people's attention from the fight against terrorists. US Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter Daesh Brett McGurk said the referendum should not be held in September because Daesh still remained a threat.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed hope that the will of the Kurdish people would be expressed peacefully and all repercussions would be taken into account.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "wgt": 100, "id": 123, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Asian", "wgt": 100, "id": 299, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Asian"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "wgt": 100, "id": 393, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc", "id": "106"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "191"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kirkuk"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkuk", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kirkuk"}, "type": "loc", "id": "1558"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "type": "loc", "id": "1579"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303036", "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303094", "label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "303326", "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303662", "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "322328", "label": {"eng": "Kurdistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "328866", "label": {"eng": "Secession"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Kurdistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraqi Kurdistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "349166"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Regional_Government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "350678", "label": {"eng": "Kurdistan Regional Government"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erbil", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erbil"}, "type": "loc", "id": "350679"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "435577", "label": {"eng": "Constitution of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri_al-Maliki", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "595726", "label": {"eng": "Nouri al-Maliki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disputed_territories_of_Northern_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1217452", "label": {"eng": "Disputed territories of Northern Iraq"}}]}

Although Iraqi Kurds do not have an independent state, they enjoy relative autonomy, especially after the US ouster of Saddam Hussain from Iraq's presidency in 2003.\n\nTurkey repeatedly declared its objection to the move and, on Wednesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, said that the referendum would worsen the situation in Iraq.\n\n\"In that country [Iraq], which has been through so many problems, a referendum on independence can make the situation even worse,\" he said.\n\n\"God forbid, it could even bring it to civil war.\"\n\nAnkara and Tehran have already announced their opposition to the referendum.\n\nEarlier, Iran warned that it would close its borders if the referendum were to be held.\n\nThe US has requested the Kurds to postpone the vote, saying that the September 25 referendum would detract from \"more urgent priorities\" in the region, such as eliminating Daesh.\n\nHowever, Iraqi Kurds have dismissed such calls and warnings. A Kurdish delegation visited Baghdad earlier this week to discuss the matter, although details of the meetings have not been disclosed.\n\nThe Kurdistan Regional Government's Head of Foreign Relations, Falah Mustafa, told Gulf News that no other alternative was offered by any of the opposing parties. Independence for Iraqi Kurds, he said, will bring the long awaited \"better future,\" and is not a move \"against the interest of any country.\"\n\nThe following are excerpts from his interview:\n\nGN: Could you please give us more details on the Kurdish delegation's visit to Baghdad? How big was the delegation? How long did the visit last? What was the goal of the visit?\n\nFM: The delegation aimed at bring about constructive negotiations between Arbil and Baghdad.\n\nIt was inclusive and included members of Kurdish and minority groups including the two main ruling parties in Kurdistan, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), and the Chief of Staff to the President of Kurdistan.\n\nThe visit was the first of a sequence of visits expected to last for a couple more days.\n\nThe high-level delegation will continue to hold several meetings with Iraqi officials in order to reach a better understanding in regards to recent political developments.\n\nGN: Why are you insisting on the referendum's date in September? What are the circumstances that make the move so timely, in your view?\n\nFM: The KRG is not willing to change the date of the referendum since those who oppose the timing have failed to provide \"the right time\" for a vote on the right to self-determination.\n\nOur leadership is keen to go ahead with it.\n\nThose who oppose it and suggest that we delay it did not offer a better alternative for us; therefore, we neither see any convincing reason, nor have received any guarantees for postponing.\n\nIraq's federalism failure has now compelled Kurdistan to seek a better future separately -- as Iraq's neighbour.\n\nHence, we want to pave the ground for future neighbourly cooperation with Iraq, and that is impossible under the current circumstances.\n\nGN: In one of your press interviews, you were quoted as saying \"the referendum is necessary to establish a healthy relationship with Baghdad\", what is your definition of the \"healthy relations\"?\n\nFM: Our definition of healthy relations is a partnership where the actors in question are equals.\n\nSince we have failed to be good partners in the so-called federal system in Iraq, we need to seek another alternative.\n\nIt will not be the end of the world when we decide that we cannot live together under one roof. Looking back at history, there are other nations that have accepted to be separate peacefully, through dialogue and now they enjoy very good relations.\n\nTherefore, we believe that we need to communicate with Baghdad; we need to ensure that they understand our ambitions and plans, and that we do not want conflict but rather to open a new chapter for our relations where we can make room for friendship and partnership.\n\nI believe that we can become better partners as two sovereign states.\n\nIt's a fact of life that the Middle East region in the last hundred years had not seen stability and prosperity because of the wrongdoings of the past, denial of identity, and lack of social justice.\n\nToday there is an opportunity for us to be courageous and to admit that we have failed in bringing about a genuine partnership; therefore engaging in a serious process of negotiations and communication with Baghdad is very important so that we communicate in order to prevent provocation.\n\nWe want Baghdad to be our partner in addressing this issue so that we can do it in such a way that we secure a strong long-term partnership with Baghdad.\n\nGN: Iraq's neighbouring countries, including Turkey and Iran warned of the consequences of declaring an independent Kurdistan, what is your comment?\n\nFM: We have always wanted good neighbourly relations based on mutual respect, understanding, and benefit. We are for building bridges and we can assure them that a future independent Kurdistan would be a partner and ally and that this step will not go against the interest of these nations.\n\nWe want our neighbours and the whole world to understand that we have always stood for peace.\n\nThe relations between Baghdad and Arbil have not nearly been in the best interest of either side and therefore we cannot continue to insist on failure.\n\nWe believe that our neighbours, friends, and partners should not persist on a failed one-Iraq policy.\n\nIn order to prevent future confrontations, we need to address this issue now to preserve and promote stability and security.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"},

Suhaib Salem/Reuters/Press Association Images. All rights reserved.Numbering around 40 million, Kurds hold the infamous title as the largest ethnic group in the world without a country. Split between Iraq, Syria, Iran and Turkey, and with sizable diasporas around the world, one set of Kurds seem to be closer to achieving the long elusive goal of independence.\n\nSince 1991 the Kurds in Iraq have operated under de-facto autonomy. However, Iraqi Kurdistan, revered across the world for its bravery and supposed secularism in an unstable region, is now subject to a never-ending list of problems.\n\nNevertheless, that has not stopped President Masood Barzani from calling a referendum to secede from Iraq. Whilst, undeniably, this is the moment all Kurds have been dreaming for, such drastic actions could prove disastrous and damage everything the Kurds have laboured for strenuously up till now.\n\nPost 2003, oil-rich Iraqi Kurdistan underwent an economic boom, drawing in investors all over the world. With ostentatious buildings under construction, an increasing tourism sector, and the erection of democratic structures, Kurdistan's future looked bright and prosperous.\n\nHowever, since the arrival of ISIS, the region has suffered a massive influx of refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs), complicating things for the small 5 million population of the area. Bearing in mind the rapidly increasing food prices, power cuts and constant demonstrations, there is no denying the cataclysmic disarray across the blemished region.\n\nThis dire situation is amplified as economic mismanagement and corruption are treated with impunity. Iraqis considered one of the most corrupt countries in the world, with Kurdistan arguably sharing a brunt of the blame. Thousands of ghost workers across the region are an example of this corruption.\n\nMoreover, for several months, the government has failed to pay the salaries of workers, including the valiant Peshmerga (the Kurdish army). Not only has this led to mass social unrest, it has also left the people with low morale and apathy. Coupled with the drop in oil-prices, an unwillingness for Baghdad to allocate funds to the region and an outstanding $20 billion debt, Kurdistan is not the bubbling metropolis it was once set out to be.\n\nConsidering these inapt circumstances, one must really question how the Kurds intend on funding such a costly project with an already broken economy and minimal funds?\n\nSince 2013, not only has President Barzani unlawfully extended his premiership, but the Kurdish parliament has also been dissolved, making any mandate to push forth a referendum ultimately undemocratic.\n\nTo make matters worse, the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) has been at constant odds with the opposing Change Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The inability for the parties to cooperate functionally in unity poses serious questions for stability in the region in any scenario of independence, with their Peshmerga already infamously divided.\n\nOn top of the fact that there are currently a number of disputed areas between the Iraqi central government and the Kurdish government making things even more problematic, the only country who has openly showed actual support for Kurdish secession is Israel.\n\nWhilst any ally would be welcomed, in the Middle East, such partnership could be disastrous on how the Kurds are further perceived by their hostile borders.\n\nSeceding from Iraq in any case, would have to be done in an amicable case. But with constant quarrels between the two and Baghdad previously refusing to pay Kurdistan's constitutional allocated budget, this will be difficult. This does not bode well for the Kurds' future, if we bear in mind the fierce opposition from numerous other Shia and Sunni groups.\n\nWith minimal allies in a country where sectarianism is rife, the likelihood of Kurds splitting in such a delicate time is only more likely to separate the country and bring about more conflict.\n\nThe Shia dominated government has constantly been accused of repressing the Sunni minority and now reports of Feyli Kurds in Baghdad being attacked also make this referendum that much more sensitive.\n\nBeyond this, with mixed communities in disputed areas and Hashd Al-Shabi only gaining more fervour and dominance across the country, the likelihood of more conflict once ISIS disappears is only stronger, and likely to encourage other minorities in the area to rebel.\n\nBeyond these barriers stand the border countries of Turkey, Iran and Syria. All countries have a sizable Kurdish population and have a long history of oppressing Kurds. All three are also adamant in Iraq's borders remaining intact. The reason being that the successful independence of Iraqi Kurdistan will diffuse to other regions, causing revolts and instability.\n\nAdded to the fact that the Syrian war has also been favourable for Kurds in Syria, the two major powers of Turkey and Iran both have reasonable fears. President Erdogan stated that the referendum \"is a threat to the territorial integrity of Iraq and is a wrong step\".\n\nWhilst in the same vein, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has highlighted opposition, arguing that the Kurdish referendum is \"opposed to the independence and identity of Iraq\".\n\nWith the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI) also stepping up attacks on military personnel in Turkey and Iran, any possibility of Kurdish secession is a major danger to them.\n\nNevertheless, both are Kurdistan's biggest trade partners, and in the event of an unwanted secession both Turkey and Iran have the option of blockading the region and ending all trade, leaving a premature naive Kurdistan starved and suffocated, with no means to build its utopia.\n\nThe Kurdistan region has more problems it can count and independence certainly won't solve any of those, but rather blow them up. Beyond that, all the border countries are clearly opposed to any referendum and the USA has also shown opposition, highlighting that international support is also limited.\n\nIn any case, it appears that the referendum is arguably nothing more than a bargaining chip used by President Barzani against the Iraqi central government, whilst also covering itself as a clever ploy to lull the suffering Kurdish population away from the on-going problems.\n\nWhilst the Kurds have undoubtedly suffered and every nation has the right to self-determination, now is the wrong time for such deluded fantasies. Considered a beacon of light by some in a tarnished region, this could very quickly go sour and mimic the failed South Sudan.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

Earlier in July, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Russia assumed that the legitimate aspirations of the Kurds should be implemented within the framework of international law. The Russian minister also expressed hope that the will of the Kurdish people would be expressed peacefully. \"Russia's position regarding the referendum is the best of all now. We have got a long-standing relationship with Russia that goes back to the times of the Russian Empire... After the fall of the regime of Saddam Hussein the relations with the Russian Federation began to develop far more actively,\" Shaways said. sputniknews.com\n\nPeshmerga ministry confident of continued U.S. funding\n\nErbil: The United States will continue to provide millions of dollars in financial assistance to Kurds on the frontlines against Islamic State IS, said the secretary general of the Ministry of Peshmerga, adding that the Kurdish forces' reform process continues. \"The US assistance is continuing which amounts to 450 million dollars, [and is] dedicated to the salary of a part of the Peshmerga Forces and fuel a part of those forces who are at frontlines,\" Lt. General Jabbar Yawar said in a statement released on Wednesday. Yawar and his team received a consulting team from the militaries of the United Kingdom, United States, and Germany on Tuesday. The Lt.

Another point of contention is the Iraqi Kurdistan's planned referendum for independence from Iraq, which is expected to take place on September 25 throughout the Iraqi Kurdistan, including on the disputed territories, such as Kirkuk, claimed both by Erbil and Baghdad.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "wgt": 100, "id": 99, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "wgt": 100, "id": 123, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Asian", "wgt": 100, "id": 299, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Asian"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "wgt": 100, "id": 888, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Flags", "wgt": 100, "id": 889, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Flags"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Flags/Regional", "wgt": 100, "id": 890, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Flags/Regional"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc", "id": "106"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kirkuk"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkuk", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kirkuk"}, "type": "loc", "id": "1558"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303036", "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305524", "label": {"eng": "Kurdish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers'_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "313342", "label": {"eng": "Kurdistan Workers' Party"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Kurdistan", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraqi Kurdistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "349166"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "350680", "label": {"eng": "Iraqi people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "435577", "label": {"eng": "Constitution of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Kurdistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "752592", "label": {"eng": "Flag of Kurdistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Turkmen_Front", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "799063", "label": {"eng": "Iraqi Turkmen Front"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkuk_status_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1304839", "label": {"eng": "Kirkuk status referendum"}}]}

Independence may well mean the loss of all these gains overnight and a dark future for them.Iraq is already suffering from deep divisions, secessionist trends and a menace called Daesh that has created deep trauma in the country. The fact that the fight against Daesh is far from over and the potential sectarian divisions remain a major threat means any independence move by the Kurds will not only seriously hurt the territorial integrity of Iraq but will also tear the country apart with repercussions that are hard to even determine at this stage. What is clear is that it will add to the instability that has been created in Iraq and Syria and thus the whole region.\n\nSo the international community, the friends of the Kurds of Iraq and the Baghdad government have to dissuade the Masoud Barzani administration not to go ahead with the referendum next month. But for this Barzani has to be shown a way out of the current mess.\n\nBaghdad is run by Shiite Arabs under the influence of Iran. Baghdad has committed numerous mistakes to alienate the Sunni Arabs and Kurds of Iraq.\n\nAt first the Americans were a part of the mistakes committed against the Sunni Arabs that pushed them into the hands of al-Qaida terrorists. However, the Americans realized their mistakes and befriended the Sunni Arab tribes and made amends. But once the Americans withdrew from Iraq and handed full control to the Shiite Arabs who were deeply influenced by Iran, the Sunnis were systematically alienated and frustrated to such an extent that they joined forces with Daesh to push the Shiite-dominated Iraqi army out of Mosul and a major chunk of Iraq.\n\nNow the Shiites have managed to recapture Mosul. Let us hope they realize they have to win the Sunni Arab hearts and souls instead of massacring them and creating perennial enemies.\n\nThe same negative Shiite Arab attitude of denying funds for the Kurds of Iraq, trying to scuttle their administration and making life hell for the Kurds have also alienated the people of the KRG. Financial problems, growing domestic woes and political bickering among the Kurds have pushed Barzani into a corner. The Kurds of Iraq want him to solve their problems. Most have the impression that independence may be the golden prescription to solve their woes. Most Kurds do not even understand or care for the referendum.\n\nKurdish intellectuals and especially the elite in the Sulaymaniyah region are questioning the merits of the referendum. They feel that the region has not done anything to lay the foundations for an independent Kurdish region and that a referendum will only mean certain disaster.\n\nAll these are fine and show that Barzani has to give up this adventure. Yet this is easier said than done. The friends of the Kurds of Iraq have to help Barzani out of this mess. They have to show him a way out. This cannot be done with threats and criticism. Thus Baghdad has to shoulder the responsibility of showing the Kurds that the policies that have alienated them will be terminated and that they have everything to gain if they remain a part of united Iraq.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Asian", "wgt": 100, "id": 299, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Asian"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics", "wgt": 100, "id": 373, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Linguistics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "wgt": 100, "id": 773, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc", "id": "106"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "loc", "id": "107"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc", "id": "212"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "type": "loc", "id": "1579"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "As Sulaym\u0101n\u012byah"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulaymaniyah", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "As Sulaym\u0101n\u012byah"}, "type": "loc", "id": "1589"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mosul"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosul", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosul"}, "type": "loc", "id": "1604"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303036", "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303094", "label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303503", "label": {"eng": "Sunni Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303510", "label": {"eng": "Al-Qaeda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305524", "label": {"eng": "Kurdish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309442", "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "309890", "label": {"eng": "Arab people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Regional_Government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "350678", "label": {"eng": "Kurdistan Regional Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "367838", "label": {"eng": "Iraqi Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Barzani", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "435417", "label": {"eng": "Mustafa Barzani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Barzani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "435418", "label": {"eng": "Masoud Barzani"}}]}

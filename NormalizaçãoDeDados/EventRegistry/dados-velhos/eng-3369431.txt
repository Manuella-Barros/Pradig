This World Humanitarian Day in Nigeria we come together to reaffirm that civilians caught in conflict are #NotATarget.\n\nWe are particularly reminded of this by the series of terrorist attacks in Konduga, Borno State, on Tuesday evening that killed 27 innocent civilians and wounded over 80 more. I condemn this attack and extend my deepest sympathies to the victims and their families. I also extend my condolences to the Government and the people of Nigeria.\n\nHere in the northeast of Nigeria civilians continue to bear the brunt of the conflict. Women, men and children face grave human rights violations and sexual and gender-based violence. Since the start of the conflict in 2009 more than 20,000 people have been killed, thousands of women and girls have been abducted and children continue to be used on a regular basis as so-called \"suicide\" bombers. Thousands of families have been forced to flee their villages, rather than build their homes, livelihoods and communities.\n\nAt the same time, health and aid workers, who care for people affected by violence, are affected by the lack of security, which constrains our access to desperately vulnerable communities. People must be put first.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has published his first report on the Protection of Civilians. He calls for enhanced respect for international humanitarian and human rights law, and protection of civilians, including humanitarian and medical workers, as well as civilian infrastructure. He also calls for the prevention of forced displacement, and durable solutions for refugees and internally displaced persons.\n\nAction is being taken: global leaders made commitments to uphold the norms that safeguard humanity at the World Humanitarian Summit last year. However, much more must be done. I call upon all parties to the conflict in Nigeria to protect civilians and prevent further pain and suffering. I should also like to reiterate the United Nations solidarity and support to the Government of Nigeria in its fight against terrorism and violent extremism.", "id": "9683289", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Statement attributable to the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria Mr Edward Kallon on World Humanitarian Day", "image": "http://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/rw-logo-square.png", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 22, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 36}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "164", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Cameroon"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bakassi Peninsula"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "73338", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakassi", "label": {"eng": "Bakassi Peninsula"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Konduga"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "74888", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konduga", "label": {"eng": "Konduga"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "75044", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borno_State", "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human rights"}, "id": "302584", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}, "id": "308426", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}, "id": "315283", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}, "id": "315520", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person"}, {"label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}, "id": "318694", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}, "id": "319035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}, "id": "319038", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}, "id": "340998", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Humanitarian Day"}, "id": "385670", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Humanitarian_Day"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Humanitarian Summit"}, "id": "1277827", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Humanitarian_Summit"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Cameroon"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bakassi Peninsula"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 42, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}], "time": "12:14:00"}

The day was designated by the United Nations eight years ago to coincide with the anniversary of the 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq.\n\n\"Every day, New Zealand and other aid workers save lives in conflicts and disasters, braving tremendous dangers and difficulties to deliver assistance to people who need it the most,\" says Mark Mitchell, Chair of the NGO Disaster Relief Forum (NDRF) - a network of New Zealand relief agencies. \"Saving lives means sharing some of the risk and hardship faced by people living in crisis. World Humanitarian Day is a chance to recognise the dedication and sacrifice of the men and women who have taken up these daunting professional challenges.\"\n\nFor far too many humanitarians in some of the world's worst conflicts, the business of saving lives is becoming more dangerous - especially for local staff - as armed groups and even armies use attacks on aid workers and relief operations as a weapon of war. In 2016, there were 288 incidents of violence committed against aid workers worldwide. According to the UN, over two thirds of all attacks on humanitarians took place in just four countries - South Sudan, Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen. Just this week, on August 15, unidentified attackers gunned down and killed three local employees of a U.S.-based aid organization in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The delivery of relief assistance to civilians in distress is a basic principle of international law,\" says Mitchell. \"The targeting of aid workers in these countries is a flagrant violation of that law, and an affront to our common humanity.\"\n\nLast year, South Sudan overtook Afghanistan as the most dangerous country for humanitarians. There are currently nine New Zealand aid agencies conducting relief operations in South Sudan.\n\nTo learn more about New Zealand's humanitarians and ways you can help deliver life-saving assistance to crises around the world, visit the Council for International Development website at www.cid.org.nz.", "id": "9794333", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "The World Humanitarian Day to remember 82 aid workers killed", "image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1509/scoop_placeholder.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 275, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false, "textEnd": 284}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 1630, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1639}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "2", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "171", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "212", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "245", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "1579", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad", "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Law"}, "id": "302557", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}, "id": "303242", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Civilian"}, "id": "307334", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian"}, {"label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}, "id": "309893", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Disaster Response Force"}, "id": "314480", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Disaster_Response_Force"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aid agency"}, "id": "314558", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid_agency"}, {"label": {"eng": "International law"}, "id": "314933", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}, "id": "315283", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}, "id": "319035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations Headquarters"}, "id": "353855", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Headquarters"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Humanitarian Day"}, "id": "385670", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Humanitarian_Day"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wartime sexual violence"}, "id": "1281432", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wartime_sexual_violence"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 289, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 901, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders"}], "time": "23:29:00"}

He added, \"World Vision stands united with others in demanding that world leaders do everything possible to ensure that these innocents are #NotATarget .\"\n\nOn World Humanitarian Day on the 19th of August, as we pay tribute to the courage and commitment of aid workers we also call for an end to violence against children and the intentional destruction of medical and education facilities.\n\nThe past two decades in history saw humanitarians face tremendous risks to save lives from the world's most dangerous conflicts. Over 4,000 aid workers were reported to have been victims of attacks while doing their jobs. World Vision has humanitarian operations in four of the five conflict-ridden countries identified where these brutal attacks happened: Afghanistan, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nThis month, Uganda has marked that one million South Sudanese refugees have crossed the border fleeing from violence in their country. Let us not forget that an estimated 60 percent of these refugees are children. A report highlights how South Sudan has overtaken Afghanistan in terms of the rising threats against aid workers and civilians.\n\nThe Aid Worker Security Database that documents these violent attacks on humanitarians also underscored the rising trend on threats and attacks against aid operations. The report is staggering and should merit an outrage from the global community. In 2015 alone, \"287 aid workers were victims of major attacks, 109 killed, 110 wounded and 68 survived kidnapping.\n\nThe UN Report in 2016 has documented attacks on over 4,000 humanitarians the past two decades: 159 major attacks against aid operations that affected 268 aid workers in 21 countries. Every month in 2016, on average more than six humanitarian workers were kidnapped; more than seven were killed and more than eight were wounded. Almost three times as many aid workers were kidnapped in 2016 as in 1997, while more than twice as many were killed.\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day marks the anniversary of the 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, when 22 humanitarian workers were killed.\n\nPlease sign the petition in support of humanitarian workers and people living in conflict zones here: http://worldhumanitarianday.org/en", "id": "9823080", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Humanitarians and civilians in dangerous conflict zones are #NotATarget", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 374, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false, "textEnd": 388}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "2", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Somalia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "207", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Somalia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "212", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "231", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "245", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "id": "303057", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Education"}, "id": "304279", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}, "id": "305933", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping"}, {"label": {"eng": "Civilian"}, "id": "307334", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}, "id": "315283", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Vision International"}, "id": "316111", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision_International"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}, "id": "319035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demographics of South Sudan"}, "id": "319079", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Sudan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian intervention"}, "id": "384133", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_intervention"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Humanitarian Day"}, "id": "385670", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Humanitarian_Day"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 289, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 901, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders"}], "time": "04:41:00"}

It was designated by the General Assembly to coincide with the date of the 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, in which 22 staff lost their lives.\n\nThe protection of aid workers is paramount\n\nThis year, humanitarian partners are coming together under the #NotATarget campaign to highlight the need to protect civilians caught in conflict, including humanitarian and medical workers.\n\n\"World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity for us to focus on protecting humanitarian aid workers, particularly in the medical field,\" Mr. O'Brien noted.\n\nCurrently, he said, humanitarian workers are operating in 40 countries across the world, often for many years, despite insufferable difficulties.\n\n\"People put themselves at great risk to reach people in need, in some of the most dangerous environments, in protracted crises around the world,\" he stated.\n\nJust recently, seven Syrian volunteer rescuers, known as White Helmets, were killed. Mr. O'Brien acknowledged that such incidents are becoming too commonplace. \"My heart grieves for the family and friends of those brave people who gave the ultimate sacrifice to help others,\" he said.\n\nDespite the difficulties and dangers, Mr. O'Brien stated that humanitarian work is moving forward \"at every point.\"\n\n\"Member States, humanitarian aid workers, coordinators of humanitarian relief - all of us continue to supply strength, determination, courage and conviction,\" he said. \"There is no higher international public good than seeking to save the lives and protect the civilians caught up in crisis.\"\n\nThe #NotATarget campaign follows the launch earlier this year of the UN Secretary-General's report on protection of civilians, in which he called for enhanced respect for international humanitarian and human rights law, and protection of civilians.\n\nThere is no higher international public good than seeking to save the lives and protect the civilians caught up in crisis\n\nAccording to the report, those most in need of urgent humanitarian assistance and protection are civilians in urban areas; children; targets of sexual violence; humanitarian workers; health workers; and forcibly displaced people.\n\nMr. O'Brien said that making a difference on the ground requires \"physical will and relationships with players in all the various places\" to get the necessary access to those in need.\n\n\"We are in the business of trying to protect civilians. We are trying to put in place the right balance. To do this, we must make sure that the perpetrators of violence are held accountable for their actions,\" he added.\n\nIt is important, he stressed, that everyone adhere to agreed international norms, laws and principles, \"to make sure that people are held to account.\"", "id": "9781914", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Protecting aid workers 'paramount,' UN official stresses ahead of International Day", "image": "http://static.un.org/News/dh/photos/large/2017/August/UNHCR-Syria-Aleppo-09.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 0, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 14}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 545, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false, "textEnd": 554}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "1579", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad", "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "id": "302547", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human rights"}, "id": "302584", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Civilian"}, "id": "307334", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}, "id": "308426", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}, "id": "308437", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}, "id": "312043", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}, "id": "315283", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Displaced person"}, "id": "316473", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displaced_person"}, {"label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}, "id": "318694", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}, "id": "319035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Public good"}, "id": "330323", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good"}, {"label": {"eng": "International human rights law"}, "id": "337702", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_human_rights_law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stephen O'Brien"}, "id": "340271", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_O'Brien"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations Headquarters"}, "id": "353855", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Headquarters"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Humanitarian Day"}, "id": "385670", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Humanitarian_Day"}, {"label": {"eng": "White Helmets"}, "id": "407980", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Helmets"}, {"label": {"eng": "Attacks on humanitarian workers"}, "id": "593607", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attacks_on_humanitarian_workers"}, {"label": {"eng": "Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator"}, "id": "605181", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under-Secretary-General_for_Humanitarian_Affairs_and_Emergency_Relief_Coordinator"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 289, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 332, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 901, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders"}], "time": "21:42:00"}

Every year, the EU marks World Humanitarian Day by adding its voice to the global campaign that honours humanitarian workers who, day after day, put their lives on the line to save the lives of others. World Humanitarian Day marks the anniversary of the 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, when 22 humanitarian workers lost their lives.\n\nHigh Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini and Commissioner Christos Stylianides, made the following statement:\n\n\"We live in a world increasingly marked by countless attacks and violence against innocent people globally. This should never become the new normal, something we leave unchallenged.\n\nHumanitarian workers who risk their lives to save others are often the targets. We saw this last week in Central African Republic or in Syria countless times.\n\nAhead of World Humanitarian Day, we pay tribute to and honour all those who risk their lives while bringing assistance to victims of wars and natural disasters worldwide. We commend the bravery of all men and women that continue to work selflessly for the benefit of others.\n\nIn long lasting conflicts, where the rules of war are ignored and trampled on, aid delivery is never easy but always indispensable. Humanitarian workers should be able to operate freely, to help those that need it most.\n\nSadly, more than 4000 humanitarian workers have bee nvictims of major attacks over the past two decades. Over one third of them were killed. These senseless attacks are a gross violation of International Humanitarian Law.\n\nWe will not allow these attacks to deter our commitment to continue to help those in need.\n\nThe EU is a world leader in humanitarian assistance and is committed to promoting global understanding of and respect for International Humanitarian Law and the humanitarian principles.\"\n\nBackground\n\nIn 2016, the EU mobilised \u20ac2.1 billion helping over 120 million people in over 80 countries around the world. This was the largest ever EU humanitarian aid budget to help those most in need, from people affected by severe large-scale crises in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan or the Lake Chad region, to victims of natural disasters such as the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, the tropical cyclone Winston in Fiji, the drought in Papua New Guinea, or the earthquake in Equator.\n\nThe EU contributes to the global respect for and compliance with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) through advocacy and political measures such as dialogue, statements and initiatives, as well as through funding to ensure humanitarian access. The EU funds IHL dissemination targeting a wide range of stakeholders, as well as activities aimed at increasing the capacities of humanitarian workers in advocating for IHL, and implements large-scale information campaigns to raise awareness of IHL across the general public.\n\nFor more information:\n\nWebsite of the European Commission's Directorate-General for European Civil

World Humanitarian Day (WHD), which takes place every year on 19 August, recognizes the aid workers who risk their lives in humanitarian ser\u00advice, and mobilizes people to advocate for humanitarian action. The day was desig\u00adnated by the General As\u00adsembly eight years ago to co\u00adincide with the anniversary of the 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquar\u00adters in Baghdad, Iraq which resulted in the death of 22 person, including UN envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello.\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day is also an opportunity to cel\u00adebrate the spirit that inspires humanitarian work around the globe and to recognize the compassion and bravery of humanitarian workers. The day also serves to gain international cooperation to meet the needs of hu\u00admanitarian work around the world. Humanitarian workers provide life-saving assistance consisting of first aid, nutrition, shelter and help rebuild after disaster has struck. These workers often battle violence, local diseases and hunger while attempting to save lives and provide relief to those most in need.\n\nTHE THEME FOR 2017: PROTECTION OF CIVIL\u00adIANS\n\nThe Day also seeks to draw attention to humani\u00adtarian needs worldwide and the importance of interna\u00adtional cooperation in meet\u00ading these needs. Every year, disasters cause immense suffering for millions of people usually the world's poorest, most marginalized and vulnerable individuals. Humanitarian aid workers strive to provide life-saving assistance and long term rehabilitation to disaster-af\u00adfected communities, regard\u00adless of where they are in the world and without discrimi\u00adnation based on nationality, social group, religion, sex, race or any other factor.\n\nHumanitarian aid is based on a number of founding principles, including hu\u00admanity, impartiality, neu\u00adtrality and independence. Humanitarian aid workers should be respected, and be able to access those in need in order to provide vital as\u00adsistance. Humanitarian aid workers can be internation\u00adal, but most come from the country in which they work. They reflect all cultures, ide\u00adologies and backgrounds and they are united by their commitment to humanitari\u00adanism.\n\nEveryone can be a hu\u00admanitarian. People affected by disasters are often the first to help their own communi\u00adties following a disaster. Re\u00adsponding to emergencies is only one aspect of humani\u00adtarian work. Humanitarian workers also support com\u00admunities to rebuild their lives after disasters, to be\u00adcome more resilient to fu\u00adture crises, to advocate for their voices to be heard, and to build lasting and sustaina\u00adble peace in areas of conflict.\n\nAround the world, con\u00adflict is exacting a massive toll on people's lives. Trapped in wars that are not of their making, millions of civilians are forced to hide or run for their lives. Children are tak\u00aden out of school, families are displaced from their homes, and communities are torn apart, while the world is not doing enough to stop their suffering. At the same time, health and aid workers who risk their lives to care for people affected by violence are increasingly being tar\u00adgeted.\n\nPROTECTING THE CIVIL POPULACE\n\nUnder the overarching theme of \"Protection of Ci\u00advilians, humanitarian part\u00adners are coming together to reaffirm that civilians caught in conflict are Not A Tar\u00adget. Through a global online campaign featuring an in\u00adnovative partnership with Facebook Live, together with events held around the world, we will raise our voic\u00ades to advocate for those most vulnerable in war zones, and demand that world leaders do everything within their powers to protect civilians in conflicts.\n\nThis campaign follows on the UN Secretary-General's report on protection of ci\u00advilians, which was launched earlier this year. Laying out his 'path to protection', the Secretary-General calls for enhanced respect for inter\u00adnational humanitarian and human rights law, and pro\u00adtection of civilians, includ\u00ading humanitarian and medi\u00adcal workers as well as civilian infrastructure.\n\nTo mark the World Hu\u00admanitarian Day, the United Nations has called of gov\u00adernments and other bodies across the globe to embark on a concerted programme aimed at mitigating the ef\u00adfect of violence, regarded as one of the newest threats to the continuous existence of human being sequel to World Health Organization (WHO) report titled: \"Vio\u00adlence, Our Concern\", said Violence accounts for over 1.6million deaths per year in every corners of the globe including Nigeria.\n\nIt stated, \"In recent years, there has been major growth in the understanding of how violence burdens com\u00admunities and contributes to a wide spectrum of health consequences and health risk behaviour in children and adults.\n\n\"With more than five mil\u00adlion deaths every year, vio\u00adlence and injuries account for nine per cent of global mortality (1.6 million), as many deaths as from HIV, Malaria and tuberculosis combined. Eight of the 15 to 29 years are injury-related; road traffic injuries, sui\u00adcides, homicides, drowning, burns, war injuries, govern\u00adments, public and private partners are increasingly aware of the strains that vio\u00adlence and injuries place on societies. In response, they are strengthening data col\u00adlection systems, improving services for victims and sur\u00advivors, and increasing pre\u00advention efforts\". WHO also emphasized that 90 per cent of deaths due to violence oc\u00adcurred in low and middle in\u00adcome countries.\n\n\"For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency de\u00adpartment visits, and thou\u00adsands do doctors' appoint\u00adments. The WHO'S 2016 World report on violence and health and its subse\u00adquent follow-up have dem\u00adonstrated that violence can be prevented and its impact reduced. Violence accounts for over 1.6 million deaths per year or 4,000 deaths per day globally. It is signifi\u00adcant public health, human rights and human develop\u00adment problem,\" the report stressed.\n\n\"Obiano lacks a real dream for Ndi Anambra. A true leader must have a dream, a vision, a focus and a tar\u00adget. The transformation of human societies depends so much on these qualities. Regrettably, the leadership of Anambra State today is a far cry from these realities.\"", "id": "9417539", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "World Humanitarian Day 2017: Protecting the civil populace", "image": "http://www.authorityngr.com/app/views/images/uploads/content_images/2017_08_16_50462.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 241, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false, "textEnd": 250}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "164", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "1579", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad", "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Health"}, "id": "302504", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human rights"}, "id": "302584", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human"}, "id": "302854", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"}, {"label": {"eng": "Death"}, "id": "302964", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Culture"}, "id": "303325", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "id": "303332", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Traffic collision"}, "id": "303586", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"}, {"label": {"eng": "Homicide"}, "id": "304079", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide"}, {"label": {"eng": "Society"}, "id": "304273", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}, "id": "304530", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}, "id": "304834", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"}, {"label": {"eng": "Injury"}, "id": "304994", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"}, {"label": {"eng": "HIV"}, "id": "305275", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"}, {"label": {"eng": "Disease"}, "id": "305821", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"}, {"label": {"eng": "Risk"}, "id": "306679", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}, "id": "307039", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"}, {"label": {"eng": "Civilian"}, "id": "307334", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}, "id": "308426", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}, "id": "308645", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emergency"}, "id": "311852", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 232, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 289, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 332, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development"}], "time": "06:47:00"}

World Humanitarian Day marks the anniversary of the 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, when 22 humanitarian workers lost their lives.\n\nHigh Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini and Commissioner Christos Stylianides, made the following statement:\n\n\"We live in a world increasingly marked by countless attacks and violence against innocent people globally. This should never become the new normal, something we leave unchallenged.\n\nHumanitarian workers who risk their lives to save others are often the targets. We saw this last week in Central African Republic or in Syria countless times.\n\nAhead of World Humanitarian Day, we pay tribute to and honour all those who risk their lives while bringing assistance to victims of wars and natural disasters worldwide. We commend the bravery of all men and women that continue to work selflessly for the benefit of others.\n\nIn long lasting conflicts, where the rules of war are ignored and trampled on, aid delivery is never easy but always indispensable. Humanitarian workers should be able to operate freely, to help those that need it most.\n\nSadly, more than 4000 humanitarian workers have bee nvictims of major attacks over the past two decades. Over one third of them were killed. These senseless attacks are a gross violation of International Humanitarian Law.\n\nWe will not allow these attacks to deter our commitment to continue to help those in need.\n\nThe EU is a world leader in humanitarian assistance and is committed to promoting global understanding of and respect for International Humanitarian Law and the humanitarian principles.\"\n\nBackground\n\nIn 2016, the EU mobilised \u20ac2.1 billion helping over 120 million people in over 80 countries around the world. This was the largest ever EU humanitarian aid budget to help those most in need, from people affected by severe large-scale crises in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan or the Lake Chad region, to victims of natural disasters such as the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, the tropical cyclone Winston in Fiji, the drought in Papua New Guinea, or the earthquake in Equator.\n\nThe EU contributes to the global respect for and compliance with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) through advocacy and political measures such as dialogue, statements and initiatives, as well as through funding to ensure humanitarian access. The EU funds IHL dissemination targeting a wide range of stakeholders, as well as activities aimed at increasing the capacities of humanitarian workers in advocating for IHL, and implements

In 2016 alone, 159 major attacks were perpetrated against aid operations, affecting 268 humanitarian workers in 21 countries.

Almost three times as many aid workers were kidnapped in 2016 as in 1997, while more than twice as many were killed. These alarming trends are highlighted in the Aid Worker Security Database, dedicated to recording major incidents of violence against aid workers.\n\nThe World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity to inform as many people as possible about the life-saving work of humanitarians, and the dangers they face every day. It is a day when people all around the world can engage in creating a more humane world.\n\nFor its part, the European Union is firmly committed to promoting global respect for and compliance with International Humanitarian Law, and the principles that guide humanitarian action - humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence.\n\nThe EU contributes to the global respect for and compliance with IHL through advocacy and political, diplomatic and communication measures. Examples of activities for the dissemination and implementation of IHL supported by the European Commission:\n\nFor further information please read our International Humanitarian Law factsheet.\n\nFor 2017, the EU has produced an outdoor poster campaign running for two weeks in seven major EU cities in five countries: Croatia (Zagreb), Spain (Barcelona), Italy (Rome), Hungary (Budapest), and Greece (Athens, Heraklion and Rhodes). The campaign consists of a series of three posters raising awareness of the plight of aid workers killed, kidnapped and wounded worldwide, and calling for more respect for them.", "id": "9203395", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "World Humanitarian Day 2017", "image": "http://ec.europa.eu/echo/sites/echo-site/files/dgecho_whs_banner.png", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 14, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false, "textEnd": 23}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Croatia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "97", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Croatia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "109", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "1579", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad", "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Croatia"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Zagreb"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "155041", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagreb", "label": {"eng": "Zagreb"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "id": "302948", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Commission"}, "id": "303458", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}, "id": "305325", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}, "id": "315283", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid"}, {"label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}, "id": "318694", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}, "id": "319035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Country neutrality (international relations)"}, "id": "326197", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_neutrality_(international_relations)"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Humanitarian Day"}, "id": "385670", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Humanitarian_Day"}, {"label": {"eng": "International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)"}, "id": "450311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Hockey_League_(1945\u20132001)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian principles"}, "id": "662237", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_principles"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 289, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 332, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 901, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders"}], "time": "03:56:00"}

A group of aid workers were taking shelter inside at the time. Nine of them, all Syrian, were killed instantly.\n\nIn February, six Red Cross workers were shot dead in an ambush in northern Afghanistan while travelling through the desert to deliver livestock supplies to people in need. Their vehicles were clearly marked as humanitarian. The International Committee of the Red Cross described the incident as the worst attack against them in 20 years.\n\nThen just last week, another six Red Cross volunteers were killed in the Central African Republic while they held a meeting at a health facility in Mbomou.\n\nIn the last two months alone, relief workers have been shelled, shot at, kidnapped and killed in Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, Somalia, South Sudan and Syria.\n\nIn 2016, 158 major planned attacks targeting aid operations killed 101 aid workers, wounded 98 and kidnapped 89. The clear majority of those killed and injured - 85 per cent - were national staff of humanitarian organizations.\n\nOne thing is clear, respect for the rules of war has collapsed in too many places. Aid workers assist the world's most vulnerable people. This means they work in active war zones, knowing the risks they face. But unlike combatants, aid workers are not party to any conflict, they are there to deliver life-saving assistance to people faced with the worst scenario one can imagine - war.\n\nOn 19 August every year, aid workers around the globe pause to mark World Humanitarian Day. On this day, we take the opportunity to honour and remember our colleagues, friends and family members who have been killed on the frontlines of crises, and to salute them for their sacrifice and service. We also come together in solidarity with the millions of civilians caught in conflict, to demand that world leaders exert all the diplomatic, political and economic influence they can to ensure parties to conflict protect civilians.\n\nAttacks are becoming increasingly brutal in nature where international humanitarian law continues to be eroded.\n\nIn one of the most heinous attacks against humanitarians in South Sudan's war, on 11 July 2016 dozens of government soldiers entered the Terrain residential compound sheltering aid workers in Juba. They gang-raped several of the female aid workers, and executed a journalist while forcing the others to watch. No one should ever endure this senseless barbarity. By such acts, the soldiers sent a message to the humanitarian community - that our neutrality is not respected and that we are not shielded as humanitarians.\n\nIn other conflicts, the delivery of aid is hampered by fighting parties, as a tactic to prevent life-saving relief reaching communities living on the 'wrong' side of the frontlines, leaving communities deprived for years on end.\n\nMedical staff in particular are often singled out for attack, with profound long-term consequences for healthcare to communities in desperate need. In 2016, 979 medical staff were killed or injured in attacks against medical workers and facilities.\n\nTwo M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res-supported hospitals in Yemen were targeted by airstrikes in 2016, even though the organization shared the GPS coordinates with the conflict parties, and clearly marked the building roofs. Between them the hospitals served over 270,000 people.\n\nMany incidents have never been investigated, and in the rare instances when investigations have been carried out, they have often failed to meet international standards.\n\nThis sends a direct message to the perpetrators; that violence against humanitarians is permissable, and that fighting parties can flout their obligations to respect international humanitarian law with virtually no consequence. So few people have been held to account that no official recorded number exists.\n\nWhile some attacks are committed by non-state armed groups, when measured by body count alone, it is states that are responsible for the highest number of aid worker fatalities. Fifty-four humanitarians were killed by state actors in 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe repercussions of attacks on aid workers go far beyond the staff themselves - these attacks deny conflict-affected people the aid they so critically need. They deprive children of life-saving treatment, obstruct families from receiving food, and rob communities from accessing shelter.\n\nWe cannot tolerate our colleagues being targeted deliberately or harmed indiscriminately. The system must change. Three concrete things can be done to better protect aid workers.\n\nFirstly, states must investigate and prosecute serious violations. States, particularly the most influential ones, must demand that warring parties, including their own forces, respect international law and hold perpetrators to account.\n\nIn South Sudan, intense international pressure led to a small number of the soldiers accused of the Terrain compound attack being brought to trial. If this trial brings some measure of justice, it will show what is possible. But diplomatic pressure must be consistent. Few, if any, of the dozens of subsequent attacks against humanitarians in South Sudan since then have brought those responsible to account.\n\nSecondly, aid organizations must always demonstrate their neutrality. We must denounce those who use aid or access as bargaining chips, holding the most vulnerable hostage. We must push against those who want to make aid a tool to reach other political objectives. If we are to help people most in need, aid must be impartial and neutral. If not, we risk becoming partisan and politicized, and targets of attacks.\n\nFinally, we must provide better duty-of-care to all staff on the frontlines, particularly national staff. International aid agencies are increasingly providing aid remotely in highly insecure environments. This means they are delivering relief through local partners and transferring the risk to them. Local and national partner organizations face an inadequate level of security and support from their international partners. We must provide better security training to equip them in the field, as recommended by the recent Presence and Proximity report on aid workers. Donors and international partners should ensure that national partners' security needs are factored into proposals and budgets, so they have the resources needed to protect their staff.\n\nMaking these changes is urgent and vital for the survival of many lives and lifelines. Today, over 141 million people desperately need humanitarian assistance, the vast majority of them affected by conflict - the highest number since records began. We cannot afford to let them down.\n\nWars have rules. It is time to enforce these rules, rather than have brave aid workers needlessly risk their lives, and too many of the most vulnerable to be left alone in the crossfire and lose theirs.", "id":

The day was designated by the United Nations eight years ago to coincide with the anniversary of the 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq.\n\n\"Every day, New Zealand and other aid workers save lives in conflicts and disasters, braving tremendous dangers and difficulties to deliver assistance to people who need it the most,\" says Mark Mitchell, Chair of the NGO Disaster Relief Forum (NDRF) - a network of New Zealand relief agencies. \"Saving lives means sharing some of the risk and hardship faced by people living in crisis. World Humanitarian Day is a chance to recognise the dedication and sacrifice of the men and women who have taken up these daunting professional challenges.\"\n\nFor far too many humanitarians in some of the world's worst conflicts, the business of saving lives is becoming more dangerous - especially for local staff - as armed groups and even armies use attacks on aid workers and relief operations as a weapon of war. In 2016, there were 288 incidents of violence committed against aid workers worldwide. According to the UN, over two thirds of all attacks on humanitarians took place in just four countries - South Sudan, Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen. Just this week, on August 15, unidentified attackers gunned down and killed three local employees of a U.S.-based aid organization in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The delivery of relief assistance to civilians in distress is a basic principle of international law,\" says Mitchell. \"The targeting of aid workers in these countries is a flagrant violation of that law, and an affront to our common humanity.\"\n\nLast year, South Sudan overtook Afghanistan as the most dangerous country for humanitarians. There are currently nine New Zealand aid agencies conducting relief operations in South Sudan.\n\nTo learn more about New Zealand's humanitarians and ways you can help deliver life-saving assistance to crises around the world, visit the Council for International Development website at www.cid.org.nz.", "id": "9793609", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "World Humanitarian Day a time to remember killed aid workers", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 210, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false, "textEnd": 219}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 1565, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1574}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "2", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "171", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "212", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "245", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "1579", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad", "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Law"}, "id": "302557", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}, "id": "303242", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Civilian"}, "id": "307334", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian"}, {"label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}, "id": "309893", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Disaster Response Force"}, "id": "314480", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Disaster_Response_Force"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aid agency"}, "id": "314558", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid_agency"}, {"label": {"eng": "International law"}, "id": "314933", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}, "id": "315283", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}, "id": "319035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations Headquarters"}, "id": "353855", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Headquarters"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Humanitarian Day"}, "id": "385670", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Humanitarian_Day"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wartime sexual violence"}, "id": "1281432", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wartime_sexual_violence"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 289, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 901, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders"}], "time": "23:20:00"}

World Humanitarian Day marks the anniversary of the 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, when 22 humanitarian workers lost their lives.\n\nHigh Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini and Commissioner Christos Stylianides, made the following statement: \"We live in a world increasingly marked by countless attacks and violence against innocent people globally. This should never become the new normal, something we leave unchallenged.\n\nHumanitarian workers who risk their lives to save others are often the targets. We saw this last week in Central African Republic or in Syria countless times.\n\nAhead of World Humanitarian Day, we pay tribute to and honour all those who risk their lives while bringing assistance to victims of wars and natural disasters worldwide. We commend the bravery of all men and women that continue to work selflessly for the benefit of others.\n\nIn long lasting conflicts, where the rules of war are ignored and trampled on, aid delivery is never easy but always indispensable. Humanitarian workers should be able to operate freely, to help those that need it most.\n\nSadly, more than 4000 humanitarian workers have bee nvictims of major attacks over the past two decades. Over one third of them were killed. These senseless attacks are a gross violation of International Humanitarian Law.\n\nWe will not allow these attacks to deter our commitment to continue to help those in need.\n\nThe EU is a world leader in humanitarian assistance and is committed to promoting global understanding of and respect for International Humanitarian Law and the humanitarian principles.\"\n\nBackground\n\nIn 2016, the EU mobilised \u20ac2.1 billion helping over 120 million people in over 80 countries around the world. This was the largest ever EU humanitarian aid budget to help those most in need, from people affected by severe large-scale crises in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan or the Lake Chad region, to victims of natural disasters such as the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, the tropical cyclone Winston in Fiji, the drought in Papua New Guinea, or the earthquake in Equator.\n\nThe EU contributes to the global respect for and compliance with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) through advocacy and political measures such as dialogue, statements and initiatives, as well as through funding to ensure humanitarian access. The EU funds IHL dissemination targeting a wide range of stakeholders, as well as activities aimed at increasing the capacities of humanitarian workers in advocating for IHL, and implements

Independent evaluations, research studies, conferences and popular books on humanitarianism tend to focus on a bewildering array of failures, problems, challenges and frustrations. On the one hand this is a good thing as it shows we are open to changing and improving but, on the other hand, it can create a pervasive feeling of gloom and doom.\n\nAnd as World Humanitarian Day 2017 approaches, it appears the demands for humanitarian assistance are greater now than in living memory. We are working in a particularly unstable world characterised by an escalation of conflict-related crises and mounting numbers and flows of displaced people, asylum seekers and refugees. And the challenge of meeting the needs of these people is heightened due to alarming decline in respect and adherence to international humanitarian law.\n\nWe are also seeing escalating risks for the safety of aid workers and, as the Emergency Relief Coordinator made clear at ECOSOC recently, \"the gap between resources and needs continue[s] to rise\". The job seems bigger, increasingly dangerous and more complicated whilst the money, staff and materials needed to do the job properly are woefully inadequate.\n\nIt is not a happy narrative and I wish it were not the case. But, although all the above is true, it does not reflect the whole picture. Not by any means. Data from OCHA's Global Humanitarian Review tells us that a lot of aid is still getting through in a variety of extremely difficult situations. For example, in 2017 over 2.2 million people received food in response to the Syria crisis, 3.3 million people were reached with emergency aid in South Sudan; and 5.8 million people received humanitarian assistance in some form in Yemen. And there are many other examples.\n\nThese figures reflect a fundamentally important truth about the people who choose to work in humanitarian assistance. In the past couple of years, I have heard many moving accounts from my old colleagues in the Red Cross/Crescent Movement about the astonishing bravery and achievements of staff from The Syrian Arab Red Crescent (to give just one example) who have managed to get aid into some truly terrible situations.\n\nIt also chimes with the key informant interviews we do for the State of the Humanitarian System report. Over the years, we have found that interviewees always articulate all the challenges and worries mentioned above but, at the same time, they usually come up with vivid examples of how humanitarian aid managed to save lives in very difficult situations and, to some extent, restore hope and dignity.\n\nThis is also reflected in the views of those who are affected by crises and, when gathering affected communities' views from Kenya and the Philippines for the Global Forum, many people were struck by the answers to the question, 'What is the main thing you want to say to humanitarians?' Along with suggestions for improvement, ran another theme: Thank you (watch video above).\n\nWhilst it is important to identify the challenges and inefficiencies of our humanitarian system, it is also the case that the bravery and fortitude of aid front line workers is still making things work against the odds. I think many of us live with this kind of 'cognitive dissonance' - and it can be uncomfortable because both sets of narratives are profoundly strong, equally true and, unfortunately, somewhat contradictory.\n\nSo, on August 17th World Humanitarian Day 2017, I will be thinking about the challenges we need to overcome, but I am also going to celebrate the fact that humanitarianism has come a heck of a long way in my life-time and the world is a better place for it. But most of all I will be thinking of those who have risked and sacrificed their lives to achieve this better world.", "id": "9716418", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "A Thought for World Humanitarian Day", "image": "http://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/rw-logo-square.png", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 3438, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3449}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "114", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "177", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "197", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Sudan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "245", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}, "id": "302509", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement"}, {"label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "id": "303062", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}, "id": "303242", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management"}, {"label": {"eng": "Narrative"}, "id": "304929", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative"}, {"label": {"eng": "Syrian civil war"}, "id": "305246", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war"}, {"label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}, "id": "306273", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dignity"}, "id": "310166", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}, "id": "315283", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Displaced person"}, "id": "316473", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displaced_person"}, {"label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}, "id": "318694", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}, "id": "319035", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cognitive dissonance"}, "id": "334759", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Doom metal"}, "id": "362600", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_metal"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs"}, "id": "374468", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_the_Coordination_of_Humanitarian_Affairs"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Humanitarian Day"}, "id": "385670", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Humanitarian_Day"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations Economic and Social Council"}, "id": "432042", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Council"}, {"label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Red Crescent"}, "id": "443216", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Arab_Red_Crescent"}, {"label": {"eng": "Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator"}, "id": "605181", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under-Secretary-General_for_Humanitarian_Affairs_and_Emergency_Relief_Coordinator"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 289, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 332, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 901, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders"}], "time": "15:03:00"}

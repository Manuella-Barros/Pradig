Bright pink Barbie home dubbed Britain's tackiest house - is finally sold after...", "text": "An 'unsellable' bright pink Barbie home has finally found a new owner after the late owner's family were left with no choice but to repaint it in a boring white. After months on the market and being changed in shade to lure potential buyers, the corner semi belonging to the late Kathy Charles - fondly known as the 'Pink Lady' - has been snapped up to the part 'sadness' of her family. Her mother Kath Platt told MailOnline today: 'The house has been sold and is going through the procedure. We're sad to see it go but pleased there's a buyer. 'We had to change the colour outside, but not inside, to get one! We had trouble selling it pink.' Mrs Platt, 88, added wistfully: 'The Pink Lady has gone now. Life moves on.' Neighbours in the street in Toton, Nottinghamshire, are pleased the house will be occupied once more after being empty for 14 months, but all agree that 'No one will live up to Kathy!' Dave Collingham said: 'She was a one off and we'll never forget her and there's a bench in her memory in the local park. 'Kathy's house was a very vivid colour, to match her personality, and it was irrelevant to me whether it stayed pink or not. No one will live up to her!' The property in Whiting Avenue is described by estate agent Robert Ellis as a 'well known house' and a 'distinctive semi on a corner plot.' But since the whole pink exterior - including the chimney pot - was painted white six months ago to attract more viewers, the original description was changed. It previously stated: 'Due to the exterior paintwork, which could easily be changed by a new owner, this is probably one of the most recognised houses in the Toton area to be placed on the market for some time.' Office manager Holly Torr told MailOnline: 'The White House has now been sold! She added: 'The sale was agreed on May 10 and is going through solicitors but has not completed yet. 'It is a family purchase and the property remains empty. 'The purchaser is aware of the back story of the lady who lived there. She was an eccentric character and everyone around here, and further afield, knew her or of her.' Miss Torr admitted that the 'vibrant colour' had put off prospective buyers, saying: 'It was not to everyone's taste but after it was re-jigged and painted white the amount of interest increased.' She said the spacious three-bed home, with no upward chain, has sold for between \u00a3195,000 - \u00a3205,000 - and 'would benefit from some updating works to be carried out.' It had originally been marketed, whilst pink, for \u00a3220,00-\u00a3230,000. Retired Players cigarette machine operator Kathy, 67, died from a sudden illness in March last year - to the shock and sadness of her family and the community. The divorcee, who had lived with a menagerie of pets including Tarantula spiders, had painted her home bright pink, both inside and out and had a matching car, furniture and possessions. Her mum, who lives in a nearby street, explained that her daughter loved the Barbie-style shade, saying: 'It was her favourite colour. 'I'm upset the pink had to go. She loved it.' Mrs Platt, who lives with her husband Syd, 95, told MailOnline how her family had reluctantly toned down the luminous landmark. She said: 'It had been on the market for eight months with only a couple of viewings and no offers. 'We had had trouble selling the house because of the colour so decided to paint it white last autumn. 'My son has organised it all and got the decorators. It looks very different all white and a bit boring! 'White just doesn't brighten up the street, the pink was like a glow. 'I would have been happy for the house to stay pink but it wasn't selling and the place needs to be sold.' Neighbour Roy Davis said: 'We've heard the house has been sold, I think to a single mum and her three kids, and we hope they are happy living there. 'Re-painting it white definitely helped the sale.' The DHL worker, who had re-painted the house in pink, second time round for Kathy, a few years ago, said: 'I'm not bothered what colour it is!' 'Now it's back white again it blends better into the street.' Of Kathy he fondly recalled: 'She was a character. She would even walk her pet lizard, this huge feet long thing, down the road and she would wear everything pink.' His supermarket assistant wife Maxine, who helped garden for the pet fanatic, said: 'She was a lovely, amazing lady and it's a shame her house couldn't stay pink. It was a Toton landmark.", "summary": "The corner semi belonging to the late Kathy Charles - fondly known as the 'Pink Lady' - has been snapped up to the 'sadness' of her family after they admitted defeat and painted it white to find a buyer", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13502437/The-price-WHITE-Bright-pink-Barbie-home-dubbed-Britains-tackiest-house-finally-sold-owner-gives-boring-paintjob.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/08/09/85868943-0-image-m-16_1717835776111.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:56:23", "author": "Editor,Tracey Kandohla", "authors": ["Editor", "Tracey Kandohla"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.066}

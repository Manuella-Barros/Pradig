{"id": 225041610, "title": "Great Translation Movement Editor Detained as He Applies for Asylum", "text": "An editor for The Great Translation Movement (TGTM) was detained upon applying for refugee status at San Francisco International Airport on March 29. Tam, hailing from Hong Kong, first joined TGTM as a volunteer. After arriving at the airport from Hong Kong with a tourist visa, he applied for asylum. Since applying for refugee status is considered as having immigration intent, he was denied entry with the tourist visa, and he had no other visas, so he was sent to a detention center by U.S. Customs and Border Protection after questioning. He was sent to the Golden State Annex, an immigration detention center in Los Angeles, where he can only communicate with the outside world by limited phone calls. Tam is due in court in June and is currently seeking a lawyer and bail guarantor. Worrying that he may end up in prison, facing torture, imprisonment, and sexual abuse if sent back to China, he calls for help from the international community. The Epoch Times has reached out to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comments but had not received a reply by press time. TGTM emerged in 2022 during Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. A group of Chinese netizens, most born after 2000, translated Chinese Communist Party (CCP) state media\u2019s content and nationalist comments into English and other languages in their original form. \u201cIn the first week of the Russia-Ukraine war in March 2022, TGTM was already calling on people to donate to Ukraine on a large scale. I was surprised that there were people in mainland China daring to donate to Ukraine, and I was moved by their dedication to freedom,\u201d Tam told The Epoch Times on May 22 in a call from the Golden State Annex. \u201cThe propaganda from China\u2019s state media is hypocritical. In China, they promote Russia as very good, just, and certain to win, but on their overseas channels, they pretend to be neutral. We thought, \u2018What the hell?\u2019 and thus started TGTM.\u201d Tam was still in college at the time. He collected screenshots of mainstream domestic comments, translated them, and connected with dissidents to help with translations and publicity. In its early stages, TGTM translated comments on Chinese networks about \u201cimporting and harboring Ukrainian beauties;\u201d news about the China-Europe freight train loaded with 41 carriages of goods departing from Xianning to Moscow; the CCP state media\u2019s claim that the \u201cSino-British Joint Declaration\u201d was an outdated and invalid document; as well as statements about the United States being the \u201cworld\u2019s number one failed country in fighting the pandemic,\u201d the \u201cworld\u2019s number one political buck-passing country,\u201d and the \u201csource-tracing terrorism country.\u201d As soon as TGTM emerged, it drew the attention and fierce criticism of the CCP state media. The movement has limited manpower, with many volunteers coming and going. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing the Great Translation since 2022, but it seems to have little effect. Hong Kong still arrests people, and China still arrests people for speaking out,\u201d he said. \u201cA foreign citizen who ran an anti-China [CCP] and anti-Hong Kong government page abroad has already shut it down, but when he returned to Hong Kong, he was arrested and sentenced to five years. We don\u2019t even know how they obtained evidence to locate us, but as soon as you return to the airport, they\u2019ll arrest you.\u201d In April, Wong Kin-chung, a Hong Kong man with Portuguese nationality was jailed for five years on \u201cincitement to secession,\u201d becoming the first dual national convicted under the newly-passed National Security Law. \u201cHe [Tam] has always been very active, but as someone who genuinely faces persecution, he is treated worse than those [Chinese] who entered the U.S. illegally,\u201d Aaron told The Epoch Times. \u201cMost of those [Chinese] entered illegally aren\u2019t actually anti-communist, yet it\u2019s the one who\u2019s anti-communist is treated this way. \u201cHe went to the U.S. to escape persecution and pursue freedom, but now he\u2019s detained in an American prison without a phone and losing his freedom.\u201d", "summary": "An editor for The Great Translation Movement (TGTM) was detained upon applying for refugee status at San Francisco International Airport on March 29.

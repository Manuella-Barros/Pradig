Oftentimes, that might mean leaving out historically marginalized groups in research design. To serve all people inclusively, it's important to research all people\u2019s needs inclusively. In my interview with Dr. Varina Michaels, founder and director of Paisley Group and executive director of Women of Colour Australia, a leading not-for-profit that advocates for, supports and strengthens the lives and experiences of women of color, she recommended starting with these questions when talking with people who want to be more inclusive with their research: Who are the communities you are trying to serve? What are their needs? How do you know? The last question is especially powerful. We tend to make assumptions about groups, especially ones that we are not part of, based on shortcut stereotypes or assumptions that have been passed down over time. Because most white people still live in highly segregated areas where they don't interact with as many people of color, they might default to false stereotypes and outdated assumptions due to their lack of direct lived experiences.

Michaels recommends that before conducting research, you get feedback from participants on the initial research plan: Is this area important or should we spend our time somewhere else? Are the questions culturally appropriate and what could we be asking to be most accessible? Did we maximize the impact of your time and accurately represent you? Settings also matter for inclusive research design. Michaels emphasizes, \u201cIf the same person takes the survey in different settings, you get different outcomes.\u201d Different settings may signal different levels of safety or have different distractions, especially for historically marginalized people. It is critical to ensure anonymity in the research design and space for candid responses. There's no point to doing the research if people aren't going to be honest about their perceptions. Center Women of Color in Inclusive Research Design As the saying goes, \u201crising tides lift all boats.\u201d When research focuses on the most marginalized people first, we create more opportunities for inclusion for the general population. People with intersectional identities, such as women of color, often bring a diverse lens, fresh perspectives and innovative thinking to the research because their experiences are unique. As Michaels shares, \u201cThe most common response from women of color is to let the work speak and not my race, color, or gender.\u201d When their voices are centered, others are uplifted. \u201cPeople cannot just take one cultural lens in a survey\u2014that does not fully reflect their full human identity. That is why it is important to take their full human complexity into the research design,\u201d Michaels comments. When we consider the dominant group's perspective in research design, we leave out a vast array of other innovative solutions and ideas that everyone can benefit from. By addressing the needs of those who face the greatest barriers, researchers can create interventions and policies that lift everyone up. It's a reminder that true inclusivity requires a commitment to justice and equity for all. Follow me on LinkedIn. Check out my website.

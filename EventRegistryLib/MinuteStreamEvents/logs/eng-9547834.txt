Because May and his new coaching staff went 8 for 8 in landing recruiting targets who made official visits to Ann Arbor this spring, both in the transfer portal and with high school prospects.\n\nAt his introductory press conference, Michigan's new head coach talked openly about wanting to field a competitive team in Year 1, and putting a product on the floor that he could \"sell going forward\" to fans and recruits alike. Now, after a six-week whirlwind that saw May assemble his staff, reinvigorate donors and the program's NIL plans, and build out a roster that features a half-dozen transfers and three incoming freshmen - two of them new recruits - he sounds ready to shoot his shot again.\n\n\"I'm probably more confident in saying that now than I was then: We expect to win,\" May said Tuesday at Crisler Center, where he met with the media for more than 30 minutes to talk about his roster and the challenges ahead. \"There won't be a night that we walk on the court this season where we say, 'Hey, we need to do this in preparation for later.' We'll have expectations when we set foot on the court to win every single night or be in position to win.\"\n\nAnd if you can do that, May went on to say, citing one of his coaching mentors in the late Bob Knight, \"then you end up winning a lot more than you lose and you put yourself in position to win championships.\" He's not promising one of those just yet, but by the looks of the roster May and his impressive young staff of assistants have pieced together, there is reason for optimism.\n\nMichigan still has one open roster spot to fill, and May sounds like he expects to do so in the next couple of weeks. But already, there's enough here to project a team capable of winning more games than it loses - far more than last year's 8-24 disaster that cost Juwan Howard his job - and maybe enough to contend for an NCAA Tournament berth.\n\n\"We're a very confident group,\" said May, who never had a losing season in six years at FAU. \"We believe in our work, we believe in our principles, our way of doing things. But we've been pleasantly surprised at how well-received this university and basketball program has been. And we've also been pleasantly surprised that the guys that joined us have. So, did I anticipate it was gonna go like this? I probably thought we would have missed on a few more guys than we have. But you know, it's speed dating, like I said in the initial press conference, and decisions are made quickly. And I do think we provided a real unique situation for a lot of these guys.\"\n\nIt started with two guys, really.\n\nOne of them is a player May knows well: 7-foot-1 center Vlad Goldin, a three-year starter at FAU making the jump to Ann Arbor as a grad transfer. His game has improved steadily over the past few years, becoming one of the nation's best post-up scorers while also flashing an impressive finishing ability in ball-screen situations.\n\nThe other lynchpin is point guard Tre Donaldson, a player who split time as the floor leader for a top-10 team at Auburn last year as a sophomore but likely will be handed the keys to run May's offense this fall. At 6-3 and 200 pounds, May describes him as a \"pass-first point guard\" and a \"strong physical guard who can defend,\" and like all but two of U-M's portal additions thus far, Donaldson arrives with multiple years of eligibility remaining.\n\nMore than just FAU guys\n\nThat speaks to the larger vision here, too. One that has come into focus quickly, but also looks different than most of us projected back in late March when this whole process started.\n\nMay didn't just pack up his FAU program and move it north this spring. He only brought two current staff members with him in Kyle Church, who added a general manager title in Ann Arbor, and Drew Williamson, who also serves as the director of player development. Former FAU assistant Akeem Miskdeen, who'd moved on to high-major jobs in the SEC at Florida and Georgia, is also on staff, along with a couple of other high-profile additions in former Oklahoma State head coach Mike Boynton Jr. and St. Mary's associate head coach Justin Joyner.\n\n\"I didn't want to work with my friends,\" May explained Tuesday. \"I want guys who will complement me and my weaknesses, guys that are gonna challenge me and my players every day and have new ideas.\"\n\nLikewise, even though there was plenty of speculation about multiple FAU starters joining Goldin here, the only other addition with ties to May's previous stop is incoming 2024 recruit Lorenzo Cason, a former FAU commit.\n\nInstead, what the Wolverines have assembled is a roster from all over, with class diversity - three seniors, four juniors, two sophomores and three freshmen - and a variety of lineup possibilities.\n\n\"We have a group that complements each other,\" May said. \"We haven't stockpiled the same type of player. And I think a lot of guys on our roster make those around them better. And that's ultimately what we're all looking for: guys that make their teammates better and impact winning.\"\n\nTo that end, it's not hard to see a path to winning now that simply wasn't there last winter for the Wolverines, who've added size and shooting and depth.\n\nGoldin figures to start at center and play 25-30 minutes a night, but Yale transfer Danny Wolf is another 7-footer who can eat up the rest of those minutes as a five-out center or play alongside Goldin as a stretch four.\n\nThe backcourt also is brimming with options. May's eyes light up when he talks about Rubin Jones' tenacity as a 6-5 defensive whiz who played point guard at North Texas but can play multiple positions. The same is true for Ohio State guard Roddy Gayle, a proven Big Ten performer who visited Creighton before committing to the Buckeyes' archrival. Nimari Burnett returns after averaging 30-plus minutes last season, while Justin Pippen, the son of NBA Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen, also has the talent and the makeup to earn a rotation spot as a freshman.\n\nIn the frontcourt is where May probably could use one more piece to complete this puzzle. But in Sam Walters, the Wolverines added a 6-10 transfer from Alabama who shot 40 percent from 3 for a Final Four team last year as a freshman. May also had plenty of good things to say Tuesday about 6-8 forward Will Tschetter, a fourth-year junior who should be a captain this fall.\n\nBut what says even more about just where things stand is what Church had to say about Michigan's scheduling plans for the 2024-25 season. That's one of his primary tasks at the moment, and with seven nonconference dates to fill, he's approaching it much like he did the last couple of years at FAU, when the Owls won a combined 60 games and made that memorable run to the Final Four in 2023.\n\n\"A lot of that depends on the guys wearing the jerseys,\" Church said, laughing. \"But we feel like we have an NCAA Tournament team. So, we're gonna schedule accordingly. And we did the exact same thing last year. We knew we had a Top-25 team coming back, so we wanted to schedule a Top-25 schedule.\"\n\nSo, there you have it: This program reboot at Michigan appears to be right on schedule.", "source": {"uri":

If you haven't kept up with the news surrounding the program in the past month and a half, you've missed a lot.\n\nThe Wolverines will feature at least 10 new players next season: six players from the transfer portal and three from the 2024 class, to go along with returnees Will Tschetter, Nimari Burnett and Jace Howard. That number includes a player who has yet to join the team: May did confirm that Michigan, as of May 7, has one scholarship spot remaining.\n\n\"After almost five weeks on the job, we feel like we've covered a lot of ground and put together a competitive roster,\" May said to open the press conference.\n\nHere are the key quotes and takeaways from May's first media availability since his introductory presser, with quotes about key players towards the end.\n\n\"It's been cool seeing the former football players reach out and the actors that went to Michigan. Everyone is excited about this university, this athletic department, and this particular case, Michigan basketball. Typically when you coach someplace, the former players care, there's a connection to that place but for the most part, former football players don't pay attention to the basketball program and vice versa. It seems like everyone connected to Michigan really cares about all things Michigan and that's cool for me.\"\n\nIn point guards: \"We attacked the point guard position with parameters. The game of basketball is changing a lot, where we went through an era where shoot-first point guards were there and sometimes that turned into shoot, first second and third. We wanted a willing passer...when (our staff) reflects on the best teams we've been apart of, it usually starts with pass-first guards. We went into this blank canvas looking for a pass-first point guard that was capable of shooting off the dribble and off the catch, and was also a capable defender. As physical as the Big Ten is as a league, we wanted a strong, physical guard that could defend and that would set the tone from the defensive side of the ball.\"\n\nIn centers & the rest of the roster: \"We needed a center that could do a lot of things so we addressed those needs and we thought now, let's fill in those other gaps with talent, with skill, with size, high basketball I.Q., those were the things we were looking for, and we do feel like right now, we have a group that complements each other. We haven't stockpiled the same type of player, and I think a lot of guys on our roster make those around them better and that's ultimately what we're looking for, guys who make their teammates better and impact winning.\n\n\"We have to do our work early. There's no reason for us to invest a lot of time, energy, effort and especially the emotional effort that goes into recruiting (if they'll have problems with admissions). There's one thing to make a call and there's another thing to be really invested in that call and be present and relational in it. We just really tried to see who fit us from the beginning, and usually the ones that fit us like us better than the ones that don't and so we just tried to streamline it by doing our homework early and getting the right information and attacking those guys.\n\n\"There were a few guys we had to stay away from. Maybe we could have gotten them in, but we didn't go down that road because we had to efficient with our time. Like I said, when we got everyone signed it was relatively simple after we got the initial transcripts and we moved it forward.\"\n\n\"I listen to a lot of podcasts, I obviously haven't had as much time the last couple of weeks, the magic number I think has been seven. If you have seven or fewer portal guys, I'll give a shoutout to the CBS guys, I think it's (Gary) Parrish and (Matt) Norlander that said 'if you have seven or less transfer portalers, that equates to success' and this is all so new, but the teams that have had 10, 11, 12 new guys from the portal, they haven't fared well...there's so little information that with the way it is now it's hard to tell, but I think our number right now is seven.\"\n\nIf the 13th scholarship player comes via the transfer portal, which at this point seems like the most likely option, Michigan will in fact have seven portal players for the 2024-25 season.\n\nMay confirmed that he has met with the guys that run the NIL collectives at Michigan.\n\n\"I have met with the guys that have run the circle collective, we have an ongoing relationship, we talk them almost every day, it's an extension of our team, our success is tied to their success and I think their success is probably tied to our success as well. Just like anything else, we all want what's best for Michigan, and so we do whatever we can to help each other be successful. Those guys have worked incredibly hard to help us get to where we need to be in the NIL space.\n\nOn NIL's role in recruiting: \"I've been very upfront and said I want our guys to be taken care of as much as any player in the country. Right now, that's not feasible, I think everyone in our locker room will be making sacrifices, whether it's financial or minutes. And ultimately, great teams have eight or nine guys that are capable of starting...there's always that fine line between (NIL) being important and not being the most important thing.\n\n\"Every situation is different: if there's a young player that has a limited value professional and they have a chance to maximize their value now and it's the most money they could ever make playing basketball, then it might be right for them to capitalize and go after the top dollar. If it's someone that has professional aspirations and maybe the goal of making millions of dollars in the NBA, then they probably should choose the right fit in terms of development, style of play, conference, everything else. Every case is different: we've had to weigh that in every recruitment and that's part of the information gathering phase...philosophically, we want the first question to be about player development and hopefully the name, image and likeness piece fits.\"\n\n\"We'd like to have two point guards on the floor at all times anyway,\" May said when asked about Rubin Jones' role \"So it's more difficult for the defense to take away the head of the snake.\"\n\n\"We play a bit egalitarian system, everyone is involved, the pro of that is it's more fun to watch, it's what the NBA is going to, it's what the world has gone to...we need a quarterback on the court, sometimes it's been our center, sometimes it's been our point guard...hopefully we have several playmakers on the court and because of guys' self-awareness, the ball will find the right guys when it needs to after the advantage is created.\"\n\n\"I didn't really want to work with my friends. My friends, know each other, share ideas. I want guys that are going to complement me and my weaknesses, guys that are going to challenge me and players every day, get better, have new ideas. They have to be great teachers. They have to be enjoyable to be around...I'm very pleased with this staff, a recruit said on a visit 'it looks like you guys have worked together for months or years' and I looked around and saw the chemistry in guys, the relationships already being built and it's excited to see.\"\n\nCenter Vlad Goldin, on the split in minutes between him & Wolf: \"Vlad I think last year played 25 minutes a game. In a perfect world we want to get him more minutes, but we play up-tempo, so it's difficult for our players to play 32-35 minutes a game...(in terms of minutes per game) Vlad will probably hover in the mid-20s, and hopefully we're able to take care of some games before the last five minutes so hopefully we can\n\nCenter Danny Wolf: \"That probably left Danny (Wolf) with 14 minutes at the five when Vlad is not in is how we envision it. Stylisitically, we play a different style of basketball. Danny is more of a five-out facilitator, Vlad is more of a traditional center but also he's expanding his game. We definitely envision those guys playing together significant minutes and also complementing each other.\"\n\nOn Wolf's skill set: \"He's a very good three-point shooter for a 7-footer, he handles the ball well, he handles it like a guard. They played through him offensively, that's how we used our backup center last year (Giancarlo Rosado), so we're very well-versed in that style of play and he fit us offensively, so the question was does he fit defensively with another 7-footer. And after watching Danny, we felt like he moves his feet well, he's got good mobility for a 7-footer, and he embraces contact so we think with a summer of strong, consistent weight work and speed work with our new strength coach, he'll be ready to go.\n\nGuard Rubin Jones: \"The reason I wanted to bring him in is so I wouldn't have to play against him anymore. He is a throwback player where he doesn't care about anything else but winning. He's got a great I.Q., his self-awareness, his ability to adapt to whatever team he's on and just be a chameleon....defensively, he played with a torn hamstring the second half of the season and we thought he was the top defender in our league, and our league was a top-10 league, the American conference. We thought he was the most impactful guard defender in the league.\n\nGuard Tre Donaldson: \"We watched Tre play and we thought he fit, he can shoot off ball screens, he can shoot off the catch, he's a winning passer. We thought the ball came out of his hands at the right time whether it was hitting the roll or spraying it out for a three. Capable defender and he came from winning, Auburn has won at a high level. He split minutes last year with a McDonald's All-American point guard...when we plugged in his numbers in a typical 28-29 minute game, he was very efficient and his numbers were very conducive to winning.\n\nGuard Roddy Gayle Jr.: \"I liked his game, I think he's got the unique ability to get downhill and draw fouls...(his ability to) offensive rebound, he runs in transition, he plays off the pick-and-roll well, he's efficient as a passer, he doesn't over dribble and I believe in his jump shot. I know he didn't shoot a great percentage last year, but I think he's a much better shooter than that...we're excited about him on a number of levels, I could probably go on for another 30 minutes talking about Roddy. I think he's a special guy.\"\n\nForward Sam Walters: \"I watched Sam play from maybe 8th or 9th grade, he's a good player from the state of Florida early...we have a lot of connections, his high school coach is from Michigan and he holds this place very highly...Alabama's staff said great things about him, and they helped us cause we thought we'd be a great fit for him.\"\n\n\"I think when you look at our roster, we're a little thin at guard depth, and those guys are going to have a chance to break into the rotation...how quickly they get acclimated to college is going to determine if they crack the rotation or not, but those guys all come from great programs, they are used to winning, they have the right substance and DNA to them, we're excited about all of them...those three are going to represent this place well and they have a bright future. I'm excited to see them grow together because they all compliment each other well.\n\nGuard Justin Pippen: \"Justin Pippen was a guy I fell in love with the first time I watched him play because of how we like to coach. He's got great pace and feel, his maturity, he looked like the son of Hall of Fame basketball player that had been around the game at a high level...Pippen can play on and off the ball.\n\nGuard Lorenzo Cason: \"A lot of people thought Cason was the best guard in the state of Florida...Cason is probably the most of a lead guard right now.\n\nGuard Durral Brooks: \"He's a Michigan man. He came through maybe the third day I was on the job and I couldn't have been more impressed with him as a person. He is likable, charismatic, and he's driven to be really good in basketball but also in life...Phat is a disruptor, he's irritant, strong defender, can score and finds ways to win.\"\n\n\"Will has been a real pleasant surprise, first and foremost, I've enjoyed getting to know him. He's going to add a lot to this team. As far as what his role is, I worked him out a few times this spring...I value his shooting, I value his toughness and when I went back and watched games from last year, it seemed like the team functioned better when he was on the court...his positional versatility, I know he played the 5 last year, I look at him as a shooting forward.\"", "source": {"uri": "maizenbrew.com", "dataType":

Because May and his new coaching staff went 8 for 8 in landing recruiting targets who made official visits to Ann Arbor this spring, both in the transfer portal and with high school prospects.\n\nAt his introductory press conference, Michigan's new head coach talked openly about wanting to field a competitive team in Year 1, and putting a product on the floor that he could \"sell going forward\" to fans and recruits alike. Now, after a six-week whirlwind that saw May assemble his staff, reinvigorate donors and the program's NIL plans, and build out a roster that features a half-dozen transfers and three incoming freshmen -- two of them new recruits -- he sounds ready to shoot his shot again.\n\n\"I'm probably more confident in saying that now than I was then: We expect to win,\" May said Tuesday at Crisler Center, where he met with the media for more than 30 minutes to talk about his roster and the challenges ahead. \"There won't be a night that we walk on the court this season where we say, 'Hey, we need to do this in preparation for later.' We'll have expectations when we set foot on the court to win every single night or be in position to win.\"\n\nAnd if you can do that, May went on to say, citing one of his coaching mentors in the late Bob Knight, \"then you end up winning a lot more than you lose and you put yourself in position to win championships.\" He's not promising one of those just yet, but by the looks of the roster May and his impressive young staff of assistants have pieced together, there is reason for optimism.\n\nMichigan still has one open roster spot to fill, and May sounds like he expects to do so in the next couple of weeks. But already, there's enough here to project a team capable of winning more games than it loses -- far more than last year's 8-24 disaster that cost Juwan Howard his job -- and maybe enough to contend for an NCAA Tournament berth.\n\n\"We're a very confident group,\" said May, who never had a losing season in six years at FAU. \"We believe in our work, we believe in our principles, our way of doing things. But we've been pleasantly surprised at how well-received this university and basketball program has been. And we've also been pleasantly surprised that the guys that joined us have. So, did I anticipate it was gonna go like this? I probably thought we would have missed on a few more guys than we have. But you know, it's speed dating, like I said in the initial press conference, and decisions are made quickly. And I do think we provided a real unique situation for a lot of these guys.\"\n\nIt started with two guys, really.\n\nOne of them is a player May knows well: 7-foot-1 center Vlad Goldin, a three-year starter at FAU making the jump to Ann Arbor as a grad transfer. His game has improved steadily over the past few years, becoming one of the nation's best post-up scorers while also flashing an impressive finishing ability in ball-screen situations.\n\nThe other lynchpin is point guard Tre Donaldson, a player who split time as the floor leader for a top-10 team at Auburn last year as a sophomore but likely will be handed the keys to run May's offense this fall. At 6-3 and 200 pounds, May describes him as a \"pass-first point guard\" and a \"strong physical guard who can defend,\" and like all but two of U-M's portal additions thus far, Donaldson arrives with multiple years of eligibility remaining.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ann Arbor, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ann Arbor, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_transfer_portal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA transfer portal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_May", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dusty May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mid-major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Atlantic_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Atlantic University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisler_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crisler Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juwan_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juwan Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auburn, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Auburn, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28840/2884048.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547834", "eventUri": "eng-9547834", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ann Arbor, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

How did they do it?\n\nMore than 1,000 players entered the transfer portal this spring. For the most part, May and his staff did not rely on statistics or analytics to help sort through the data. They leaned on prior relationships.\n\nMay has compared the process to speed dating. With limited time -- talented players typically don't stay in the portal long -- it's difficult to get to know a player off the court as well as May would like. That's where his experience scouting players as Florida Atlantic's coach paid off. \"Everyone we've signed we had some type of background with,\" May said.\n\nThe result was six incoming transfers (with one more still out there), two new high school additions (to go along with one who signed under May's predecessor, Juwan Howard), and three returners.\n\n\"We're trying to find guys that are incredibly competitive, that love the game of basketball and what comes with it,\" May said. \"We've typically been attracted to those guys and those guys have been attracted to us.\"\n\nPotential additions of course needed a baseline talent level, with May putting a premium on outside shooting, size, and basketball IQ. He wants his teams play fast and shoot a lot of 3s.\n\nThis is college basketball, so the academic component matters too, especially for transfers who haven't graduated from their previous school. Howard ran into this issue a few times while trying to add transfers.\n\nMay didn't want to waste time nor \"emotional energy\" pursuing players that weren't going to get admitted to Michigan. \"We just tried to streamline it by doing our homework early, getting the right information, and attacking those guys,\" he said. \"There were a few guys that we had to stay away from. Maybe we could have gotten them in. We didn't go down that road because we had to be so efficient with our time. Out of all the guys we signed, it was relatively simple after we got their initial transcripts.\"\n\nAccording to staffers, eight players visited campus for official visits and all of them have since signed. That perfect success rate surprised even the confident May, who figured Michigan would miss on a few guys.\n\nMichigan prioritized the point guard spot, seeking a pass-first player who could also shoot. May knew Auburn sophomore Tre Donaldson from his AAU days in Florida. \"When he went into the portal, we didn't have to do a lot of homework,\" May said. \"We knew a lot about him already.\" It helped that another yet-to-be-announced staffer played at Auburn and watched a lot of games the last couple of years.\n\nNext was a center, and Michigan ended up with two: Yale sophomore Danny Wolf and Florida Atlantic senior Vlad Goldin. May obviously knew Goldin well. One of May's sons played high school basketball with a current Yale player, which had May paying a little more attention to that program than he would have otherwise.\n\nAfter addressing those two key positions, Michigan filled in the gaps with versatile guards and forwards. Incoming freshman Lorenzo Cason was committed to play for May at Florida Atlantic. Rubin Jones, a senior from North Texas, was in the same conference as Florida Atlantic the past four years.\n\nAlabama sophomore Sam Walters is from Florida; May recruited him out of high school. May is also close with the Alabama coaching staff. \"Anytime a player leaves and he did a nice job and was a good person, the staff usually tries to help him,\" May said. \"They said great things about him. And I think they helped us because they thought we would be a good fit for him after he decided to go in (to the portal).\"\n\nThe connections weren't necessarily as strong (or as obvious) with the rest of the additions, but they wound up in Ann Arbor just the same. May is high on Ohio State sophomore Roddy Gayle Jr., highlighting his ability to get to the foul line and believing his true 3-point accuracy is closer to what he did as a freshman (43 percent) than last season (28 percent). May appreciates incoming freshman Justin Pippen's pace and feel for the game.\n\nOn top of those eight aforementioned players, Michigan retained incoming freshman Durral Brooks, seniors Nimari Burnett and Jace Howard, and redshirt sophomore Will Tschetter.\n\n\"We do feel like we have a group that complements each other,\" May said. \"We haven't stockpiled the same type of player. I think a lot of guys on our roster make those around them better.\n\n\"That's ultimately what we're all looking for: guys that make their teammates better and impact winning.\"\n\nWith one scholarship still open, May said he is being \"patient yet aggressive\" searching for the fight fit, trying to determine whether it's best to pursue a player who helps more in the short-term or long-term.\n\nSix years ago, May had to rebuild the Florida Atlantic roster, and he had to do it without the transfer portal. He signed 10 players, but had to settle mostly for grad transfers, junior college players, and unsigned high school prospects.\n\nThis time around, he had a lot more options.\n\n\"I'm never going to complain about something we benefit from. Do I prefer it this way? No. I would enjoy coaching guys five years (more than I do coaching them for just one). I also enjoy the one-year relationships as well and trying to leave a mark in a short period of time. There's no doubt we couldn't have put together this team (six) years ago.\"\n\nHe has enough young players on the roster that he shouldn't have to do this same exercise again next year. Regardless, he's assembled an impressive squad, at least on paper. He said at his introductory press conference on March 26, when the roster was nearly barren, that his goal was to be competitive in his first season, not simply build for the future.\n\n\"I'm probably more confident saying it now than I was then,\" he said on Tuesday. \"We expect to win.\"", "source": {"uri": "mlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mlive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Because May and his new coaching staff went 8-for-8 in landing recruiting targets who made official visits to Ann Arbor this spring, both in the transfer portal and with high school prospects.\n\nAt his introductory press conference, Michigan's new head coach talked openly about wanting to field a competitive team in Year 1, and putting a product on the floor that he could \"sell going forward\" to fans and recruits alike. Now, after a six-week whirlwind that saw May assemble his staff, reinvigorate donors and the program's NIL plans, and build out a roster that features a half-dozen transfers and three incoming freshmen -- two of them new recruits -- he sounds ready to shoot his shot again.\n\n\"I'm probably more confident in saying that now than I was then: We expect to win,\" May said Tuesday at Crisler Center, where he met with the media for more than 30 minutes to talk about his roster and the challenges ahead. \"There won't be a night that we walk on the court this season where we say, 'Hey, we need to do this in preparation for later.' We'll have expectations when we set foot on the court to win every single night or be in position to win.\"\n\nAnd if you can do that, May went on to say, citing one of his coaching mentors in the late Bob Knight, \"then you end up winning a lot more than you lose and you put yourself in position to win championships.\" He's not promising one of those just yet, but by the looks of the roster May and his impressive young staff of assistants have pieced together, there is reason for optimism.\n\nMichigan still has one open roster spot to fill, and May sounds like he expects to do so in the next couple of weeks. But already, there's enough here to project a team capable of winning more games than it loses -- far more than last year's 8-24 disaster that cost Juwan Howard his job -- and maybe enough to contend for an NCAA Tournament berth.\n\n\"We're a very confident group,\" said May, who never had a losing season in six years at FAU. \"We believe in our work, we believe in our principles, our way of doing things. But we've been pleasantly surprised at how well-received this university and basketball program has been. And we've also been pleasantly surprised that the guys that joined us have. So, did I anticipate it was gonna go like this? I probably thought we would have missed on a few more guys than we have. But you know, it's speed dating, like I said in the initial press conference, and decisions are made quickly. And I do think we provided a real unique situation for a lot of these guys.\"\n\nIt started with two guys, really.\n\nOne of them is a player May knows well: 7-foot-1 center Vlad Goldin, a three-year starter at FAU making the jump to Ann Arbor as a grad transfer. His game has improved steadily over the past few years, becoming one of the nation's best post-up scorers while also flashing an impressive finishing ability in ball-screen situations.\n\nThe other lynchpin is point guard Tre Donaldson, a player who split time as the floor leader for a top-10 team at Auburn last year as a sophomore but likely will be handed the keys to run May's offense this fall. At 6-3 and 200 pounds, May describes him as a \"pass-first point guard\" and a \"strong physical guard who can defend,\" and like all but two of U-M's portal additions thus far, Donaldson arrives with multiple years of eligibility remaining.\n\nMore than just FAU guys\n\nThat speaks to the larger vision here, too. One that has come into focus quickly, but also looks different than most of us projected back in late March when this whole process started.\n\nMay didn't just pack up his FAU program and move it north this spring. He only brought two current staff members with him in Kyle Church, who added a general manager title in Ann Arbor, and Drew Williamson, who also serves as the director of player development. Former FAU assistant Akeem Miskdeen, who'd moved on to high-major jobs in the SEC at Florida and Georgia, is also on staff, along with a couple of other high-profile additions in former Oklahoma State head coach Mike Boynton Jr. and St. Mary's associate head coach Justin Joyner.\n\n\"I didn't want to work with my friends,\" May explained Tuesday. \"I want guys who will complement me and my weaknesses, guys that are gonna challenge me and my players every day and have new ideas.\"\n\nLikewise, even though there was plenty of speculation about multiple FAU starters joining Goldin here, the only other addition with ties to May's previous stop is incoming 2024 recruit Lorenzo Cason, a former FAU commit.\n\nInstead, what the Wolverines have assembled is a roster from all over, with class diversity -- three seniors, four juniors, two sophomores and three freshmen -- and a variety of lineup possibilities.\n\n\"We have a group that complements each other,\" May said. \"We haven't stockpiled the same type of player. And I think a lot of guys on our roster make those around them better. And that's ultimately what we're all looking for: guys that make their teammates better and impact winning.\"\n\nTo that end, it's not hard to see a path to winning now that simply wasn't there last winter for the Wolverines, who've added size and shooting and depth.\n\nGoldin figures to start at center and play 25-30 minutes a night, but Yale transfer Danny Wolf is another 7-footer who can eat up the rest of those minutes as a five-out center or play alongside Goldin as a stretch four.\n\nThe backcourt also is brimming with options. May's eyes light up when he talks about Rubin Jones' tenacity as a 6-5 defensive whiz who played point guard at North Texas but can play multiple positions. The same is true for Ohio State guard Roddy Gayle, a proven Big Ten performer who visited Creighton before committing to the Buckeyes' archrival. Nimari Burnett returns after averaging 30-plus minutes last season, while Justin Pippen, the son of NBA Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen, also has the talent and the makeup to earn a rotation spot as a freshman.\n\nIn the frontcourt is where May probably could use one more piece to complete this puzzle. But in Sam Walters, the Wolverines added a 6-10 transfer from Alabama who shot 40 percent from 3 for a Final Four team last year as a freshman. May also had plenty of good things to say Tuesday about 6-8 forward Will Tschetter, a fourth-year junior who should be a captain this fall.\n\nBut what says even more about just where things stand is what Church had to say about Michigan's scheduling plans for the 2024-25 season. That's one of his primary tasks at the moment, and with seven nonconference dates to fill, he's approaching it much like he did the last couple of years at FAU, when the Owls won a combined 60 games and made that memorable run to the Final Four in 2023.\n\n\"A lot of that depends on the guys wearing the jerseys,\" Church said, laughing. \"But we feel like we have an NCAA Tournament team. So, we're gonna schedule accordingly. And we did the exact same thing last year. We knew we had a Top-25 team coming back, so we wanted to schedule a Top-25 schedule.\"\n\nSo, there you have it: This program reboot at Michigan appears to be right on schedule.", "source": {"uri":

Eight players have come on board since May was hired, including two high school recruits and six transfers. May and his staff started with a big pool of players they recruited or scouted in the past, narrowed it to the best fits and pitched a perfect game with the prospects who visited campus.\n\n\"We're eight-for-eight for guys coming on a visit,\" assistant coach Akeem Miskdeen said.\n\nWith so many scholarships to fill, May realized he couldn't waste time chasing players who wouldn't end up at Michigan. He started by requesting transcripts from every player Michigan was recruiting, ensuring there wouldn't be any surprises like Michigan had in previous years with Caleb Love and Terrence Shannon. He made calls to donors so Michigan could offer the most competitive NIL package possible, although Miskdeen said the players on Michigan's radar cared more about a different number.\n\n\"Minutes,\" Miskdeen said. \"If you're in the transfer portal, you're going to ask about minutes.\"\n\nFortunately, Michigan has a lot of those to offer. May and his assistants were honest about what they envisioned for each player's role and how they saw each transfer fitting into the roster. The priorities were to add a pass-first point guard, a low-post presence and players who can shoot and defend on the wing. May was confident Michigan would end up with good players in those roles, but even he was surprised by the success rate on the players Michigan targeted.\n\n\"We tried to really see who fit us from the beginning,\" May said. \"Usually the ones that fit us like us better than ones that don't. We just tried to streamline it by doing our homework early, getting the right information and attacking those guys.\"\n\nHere's a closer look at Michigan's roster additions:\n\nOne of the first items on May's list was a point guard who could get the ball to the right players in the right spots, shoot off the catch and the dribble and play physical defense on the perimeter. Michigan found that player in Tre Donaldson, who averaged 6.7 points and 3.2 assists in roughly 20 minutes per game as a sophomore at Auburn.\n\n\"We watched Tre play, and we just thought he fit,\" May said. \"He can shoot off ball screens. He can shoot off the catch. He's a willing passer. We felt like the ball came out of his hands at the right time, whether it was hitting the roll or spraying out for a 3.\"\n\nDonaldson had an assist on 28.4 percent of his teammates' baskets when he was on the floor, which was fourth in the SEC, according to Kenpom. He can become a better finisher at the rim, Miskdeen said, but he fits Michigan's style as a 6-foot-3 guard who shot 41.2 percent from 3-point range last season.\n\n\"When we plugged in his numbers in a typical 28- or 29-minute game, he was very efficient,\" May said. \"His numbers were very conducive to winning.\"\n\nMay said he likes having multiple ballhandlers on the floor, which could create opportunities for incoming freshmen Durral Brooks, Lorenzo Cason and Justin Pippen, a 6-4 combo guard from California and the son of NBA legend Scottie Pippen.\n\n\"Justin Pippen was a guy I fell in love with the first time I watched him play because of how we like to coach,\" May said. \"He's got a great pace and feel. He looked like the son of a Hall of Fame basketball player.\"\n\nMichigan added a scorer who can get to the foul line in Ohio State transfer Roddy Gayle, a defensive stopper in North Texas transfer Rubin Jones and a pure shooter in Alabama transfer Sam Walters.\n\nGayle averaged 13.5 points last year as a sophomore at Ohio State but shot just 28.5 percent from 3-point range, which makes him an outlier among the players Michigan targeted. But Gayle was a 43-percent 3-point shooter as a freshman, and May believes he's a better shooter than last year's numbers show. Gayle also can get to the foul line, which fills a need for Michigan.\n\n\"I watched him play a few times randomly throughout the season, and I liked his game,\" May said. \"I think he's got a unique ability to get downhill and draw fouls.\"\n\nMay coached against Jones last season when FAU faced North Texas and thought he was the best perimeter defender in the American Athletic Conference, despite playing the second half of the season with a torn hamstring. A 6-5, Jones is a \"chameleon,\" May said, who can be a second ballhandler and play any of the perimeter positions.\n\n\"He is a throwback player,\" May said. \"He doesn't care about anything other than winning.\"\n\nWalters is a catch-and-shoot threat at 6-10 who averaged 5.4 points in a little more than 12 minutes per game as a freshman at Alabama. He's originally from Florida, and May has been watching him play since he was in eighth or ninth grade. Once Walters entered the portal, the coaches at Alabama provided an assist in helping him land at Michigan.\n\n\"Our staff was close with their staff,\" May said. \"Anytime a player leaves and he did a nice job and he's a good person, the staff usually tries to help them. They say great things about him. I think they helped us because they thought we would be a good fit for him.\"\n\nThe final piece of Michigan's portal plan was a big one: Vlad Goldin, the 7-1 center who averaged 15.7 points and 6.9 rebounds last season at FAU. The Wolverines already had a commitment from Danny Wolf, a 7-footer who averaged 14.1 points and shot 47 percent from 3 last year at Yale, and May is confident there will be room for both.\n\n\"We play up-tempo, a lot of possessions, so it's difficult for our players to play 32 to 35 minutes a game if we're playing the style that we like to play,\" May said. \"Vlad will probably hover around the mid-20s if he's playing at his best. That left us probably playing Danny at 14 minutes a game at the five when Vlad's not in.\"\n\nGoldin is a more traditional back-to-the-basket scorer, whereas Wolf will allow Michigan to run more five-out offense. May envisions having both on the floor at times.\n\n\"The question was, does it fit defensively with another 7-footer or 7-foot-1 guy?\" May said. \"After watching Danny, we felt like he moves his feet well. He's got good mobility for a 7-footer, and he embraces contact. With a summer of really strong, consistent weight work and speed work with our new strength coach, he'll be ready to go.\"\n\nWill Tschetter, Nimari Burnett and Jace Howard are set to return from last year's team, which leaves Michigan with one open scholarship. Burnett, a starter who averaged 9.6 points last season, gives Michigan another shooter and ballhandler in the backcourt, and Tschetter and Howard add depth on the wing. Tschetter and Burnett could have commanded NIL offers in the portal, Miskdeen said, and Michigan's coaches recruited them the way they recruited the players who joined from outside.\n\n\"We're all in this together,\" Miskdeen said. \"This is Dusty May's team. All you guys are his recruits. They had to decide to come back, right? Some of those guys like Nimari, Will, they could have gone to some places. We were fortunate enough for them to stay.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_meek@theathletic.com", "name": "Austin

He's optimistic for a variety of basketball- and team-culture-related reasons. But perhaps most notably, he feels confident that he didn't get too many guys from the portal.\n\n\"If you have seven or less transfer portalers, that equates to success,\" May said. \"This is all so new that the teams who have had 10, 11, 12 new guys from the portal, I think, they haven't fared well.\"\n\nMay's assertion is an interesting one. Each offseason, teams at every level of all college sports are trying to strike this balance. Too many transfers, you risk muddying the culture and upsetting the developmental track of guys who have been there. Too few transfers, you risk falling behind from a talent standpoint while failing to maximize the players who were already there.\n\nBut perhaps more interesting than May's statement on the whole is where he heard it: \"The Eye on College Basketball\" podcast with CBS Sports' Gary Parrish and Matt Norlander.\n\n\"I'll give a shout-out to the CBS guys,\" May said, \"I think it's Parrish and Norlander that said it.\"\n\nDoes this mean May would have turned down a blue-chip player if one came his way at the last minute, just to avoid reaching eight transfers? Probably not. But the situation, in many ways, is a microcosm of his approach to coaching.\n\nIronically enough, assistant coach Justin Joyner -- who didn't know May personally before taking the job at Michigan -- became a fan of May's years ago by studying him \"through podcasts and interviews.\" These clips and soundbites demonstrated how May was \"on the front edge in terms of being creative offensively.\"\n\n\"The ability to instill concepts versus plays. When you do that, you allow players to play with great freedom, and that was a little bit different than what I've been accustomed to, but it's something I respect,\" Joyner said.\n\n\"I think of myself as a player and how I would like to be, how I would like to play, would be like that. I think of recruits -- that's an attractive brand of basketball for a recruit. It's on the cutting edge, it's forward-thinking; it's professional. That's where the game is going and I want to be part of that.\"\n\nMay, 47, led Florida Atlantic to six consecutive winning seasons in addition to the program's first-ever regular-season and (Conference USA) tournament titles, plus a trip to the 2023 Final Four.\n\nHe is a man at the top of his profession who is constantly poring over every new bit of information he can from any source -- from other coaches or pundits, it doesn't matter. On Tuesday, May recalled a story from his early days at Florida Atlantic. His teams couldn't draw fouls, no matter how hard they tried. He called around to \"the best coaches and teachers that I know.\"\n\n\"Finally, a good friend who I lean on a lot for advice just said, 'Hey, you gotta recruit (players who can get to the foul line). That's something you have to recruit,\" May said. \"It always kind of stuck with me.\"\n\nEver since that conversation, May has made it a point to recruit players with the ability to draw fouls. It's a piece of information he doesn't have to think about -- it's just ingrained in him now.\n\n\"He's really, really good at what he does already. But it's like he's got something that's continuing to push him and say, 'That's last year. That's yesterday. I was really good yesterday but I got to get even better today,'\" said assistant coach and director of player development Drew Williamson, who followed May to Ann Arbor after three seasons at Florida Atlantic.\n\n\"He has that mindset where every single day, it's like a challenge for himself to get better, but also a challenge to be able to figure out ways to help each player in that locker room get better that day. So most of the guys in here, he watches so much film of them every single day. It's like he's trying to find one thing that he can help them with tomorrow.\"\n\nMay's assistants said it's become common to receive a text message from the head coach, linking to an audiobook or podcast.\n\n\"Any time we're in the car, if you're driving him somewhere, he's plugging his podcast in,\" assistant coach/general manager Kyle Church said.\n\n\"When we walk into the office in the morning, he takes his first ... 30 minutes, maybe an hour, to sit down and read a book. He does not waste a second of the day. I can certainly attest to that.\"\n\nChurch said May's hunger has built upon itself.\n\n\"We've known each other for 13, 14 years now ... and it seems like every year, it's even more,\" Church said. \"The success has made him hungrier or thirstier for knowledge, to keep growing on it -- so honestly, being able to see it firsthand is inspiring and he's been an unbelievable mentor for me, so I've enjoyed watching him over the years.\"\n\nWhen May sits down to consume college basketball content, he's not doing so with the intention of changing his entire brand of coaching. He's just looking for the one or two things that can give him -- or a player or staff member -- an advantage.\n\n\"Being around him every single day, you understand the purpose of it now. Just being able to see that I don't have to know this entire book,\" Williamson said.\n\n\"If I can get two or three things out of this book to help Vlad Goldin next year, it was worth reading that book. So, that's his process.\"\n\nWell, that's part of his ever-changing process, anyway.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ann Arbor, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ann Arbor, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_May", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dusty May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisler_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crisler Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Parrish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gary Parrish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Atlantic_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Atlantic University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_chip_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blue chip (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_USA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conference USA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/03/26/PDTN/73108024007-20240326-rbspdustymay-142.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3397,1912,x0,y133&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547834", "eventUri": "eng-9547834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

May was officially introduced two days later. Aside from his wife, Anna, and his three sons; Jack, Charlie, and Eli who were seated in the front row, May was all alone.\n\nAt the time there were no coaches in the fold (at least none who were staying) and no players on the roster. So, it was on the Peoria, Ill., native, moving back to his Big Ten roots, to put together the bones of his new program from scratch. In the 42 days since May first spoke at a microphone in Ann Arbor, he's done exactly that.\n\nHEAR FROM THE MAN AT THE TOP: Michigan AD Warde Manuel exclusive interview: How he's navigating transfer portal era\n\nHe compiled a staff with five assistant coaches, which now is comprised of people like Kyle Chruch - also named the program's general manager as he's on his fourth straight team alongside May - as well as Mike Boynton Jr., a former Power Five head coach (Oklahoma State) who's shown the pedigree to recruit the No. 1 player in the nation when he lured current Pistons star Cade Cunningham to Stillwater.\n\nThere's also Akeem Miskdeen; former Georgia assistant who spent three years with May prior at FAU (2018-21); Drew Williamson, director of player development, who also held the same title the past three years in Boca Raton; and Justin Joyner after seven years at Saint Marys.\n\n\"Everything I've ever been taught growing up is that you hire guys you know, you hire guys you worked with, hire guys you trust, hire guys who are loyal to you,\" May said. \"As far as knowing guys, I didn't want to work with my friends. ... I want guys who will complement me and my weaknesses, guys that are gonna challenge me and my players every day.\"\n\nFrom there, it was controlled chaos for more than a month as the staff searched far and wide to compile its 2024-25 roster. In all, May and company landed six players via the transfer portal, held onto two from last year's team (Nimari Burnett and WIll Tschetter) and hauled in three freshmen, only one of whom was committed to the previous regime.\n\nU-M has one scholarship remaining, which is still not decided if it will be geared toward this year or long term.\n\n[ MUST LISTEN: Make \"Hail Yes!\" your go-to Michigan Wolverines podcast, available anywhere you listen to podcasts (Apple, Spotify) ]\n\nMay said six weeks prior that his expectation is to win right away. On Tuesday, with the whirlwind now somewhat, almost, finally, for the most part, behind him, he said it with a bit more authority.\n\n\"I'm probably more confident saying that now than I was then,\" May said in the Crisler Center media room. \"We expect to put a team on the court that is going to compete at a high level every single night and with the talent level we have, there's no reason why we couldn't expect to win a lot of those.\"\n\nAll about the connections\n\nThose who've followed U-M basketball in recent years know the stories of guys like Terrance Shannon Jr., Caleb Love and Papa Kante; highly regarded transfers or incoming freshmen who were committed to the program verbally but ultimately not able to get into the university on the academic side.\n\nWith that knowledge in his back pocket, May said he and his staff were deliberate with their time in the portal.\n\n\"We have to do our work early,\" May said about what he learned. \"There's no reason to invest time, energy and effort ... we just tried to really see who fit us from the beginning. ... there were a few guys we had to stay away from.\n\n\"Maybe we could've got them, but we didn't go down that road because we had to be so efficient with our time.\"\n\nThat time seemed to work out just fine according to coaches like Church, Williamson and Miskdeen, all of whom repeated the same line at some point or another during their portion of the meet and greet.\n\n\"Eight for eight,\" each said with a smile, referencing how U-M landed all eight of its top outside targets (in addition to Tschtter, Burnett and previously Durral 'Phat Phat' Brooks) that it devoted true time to landing.\n\n\"We're a very confident group,\" May said. \"We believe in our work, we believe in our principles and our way of doing things. So we were pleasantly surprised at how well-received this university basketball program has been and we've also been pleasantly surprised that the guys that joined us have.\n\n\"Did I anticipate it would go like this? I probably would've thought we would've missed on a few more guys than we have. ... but I think we provided a real unique situation for a lot of these guys.\"\n\nBlank Canvas\n\nNot only did U-M have to move with intention, it also had to have an idea of the roster it wanted to form.\n\n\"We went into this blank canvas looking for a pass-first point guard who is capable of shooting off dribble and catch,\" May said. (He has to) also a physical defender to set the tone.\"\n\nInsert former Auburn ball handler Tre Donaldson, who stands 6-foot-2, 190 pounds and was looking for a new home after splitting time with the Tigers' Aden Holloway last year. He fit the mold of what U-M was looking for perfectly; he has Florida ties (Tallahassee native) and a staffer joining U-M next week per May is an Auburn alum (it's not yet been announced, but KT Harrell fits that description) had additional insight.\n\n\"We just thought he fit. Can shoot of ball screens, off the catch, willing passer,\" May said. \"He was very efficient and his numbers were conducive to winning.\"\n\nThen, there's North Texas shooting guard Rubin Jones. The graduate transfer who's on the team for one reason.\n\n\"I didn't want to have to play against him anymore,\" May joked of Jones, who he called him a \"throwback\" player, with a high EQ and an ability to adapt to whatever team he's on like a \"chameleon.\" May also mentioned how Jones played the second half of last year's team with a torn hamstring, and his staff thought Jones (as an opponent) was still \"the best wing defender\" in the conference.\n\nExpected to split time with Jones at the two, former Ohio State shooting guard Roddy Gayle Jr.\n\nAsked about him, May said he could go on for \"30 more minutes\" with everything he could say about OSU's third-leading scorer from a season ago, but instead kept it rather concise about what excites him most - even beyond how he runs in transition, plays off the pick and roll and offensive rebounds.\n\n\"A unique ability to get down hill,\" May said.\n\nMay told a story about how he longed for more players to develop that ability year after year in his early days at FAU before a trusted advisor told him \"that's something you have to recruit\" and it \"always kind of stuck.\" Gayle is at the top of the list for that skill on the current roster.\n\nAt the forward spot, U-M rather quickly landed 6-foot-10 knockdown artist Sam Walters from Alabama. May has known Walters since he was in ninth grade when he had a high school coach with Michigan ties, which is really how the fit materialized in the first place.\n\nThere was also some help from another former high school coach with Michigan ties, Nate Oats.\n\n\"We knew a lot of people around him,\" May said of Walters. \"It was a quick recruitment, also coaches at Alabama, our staff is close with their staff. ... they said great things about him and I think they helped us because they thought we'd be a good fit for him.\"\n\n'Guys we're excited to grow with'\n\nFor all the talent at guard and wing that U-M added, much of the excitement is contained in the form of a pair of 7-footers; Vladimir Goldin (FAU) and Danny Wolf (Yale), both of whom nearly averaged 15 points and 10 rebounds a season ago and were named to their all-league teams.\n\nIt appears the team will orbit around new 7-foot-1 center Goldin, who Williams worked with in detail during his time with the Owls. He emphasized his development on the defensive end and said he has defensive player of the year capability as a rim protector.\n\n\"It allows the guards and wings to be more aggressive,\" Williams said of his length. \"Just the amount of shots he affects.\"\n\nGoldin is more of a traditional inside center while Wolf can stretch the floor; he knocked down 34.5% (29 of 84) of his long balls last year. The idea is for Goldin to play at least 25 minutes per night at the 5, while Wolf would handle the rest. And yes, there's no doubt U-M will employ a twin towers look as part of its rotation.\n\n\"We definitely envision those guys playing together significant minutes,\" May said. \"And also complimenting each other.\"\n\nChurch said the quiet part out loud Tuesday: \"We feel we have an NCAA tournament team.\"\n\n\"We wanted to add some young guys with some old guys, but most importantly, get guys that fit culturally and have a baseline of talent,\" May said. \"It's been enjoyable to see the group come together, to try to fit these pieces and parts together, use our imagination based on past experience and find the guys that we felt like were right for this university and right for us.\n\n\"Because of the staff's diligence, their hard work, the relationships that have been built over time, we were able to get guys that we're extremely excited to grow with.\"", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Wolverines have one more roster spot to work with after bringing in eight athletes to the fold on top of what was in place when they arrived.\n\nNIL is one of the three main discussion points when speaking with any recruit, May has said, and he embraces it. He's met with donors in order to boost the amount of money Michigan has in its Champions Circle collective and is all for his players earning opportunities to market themselves.\n\nMichigan's pool of money has increased since May was hired March 24, so it's a moving target, but building a roster in today's college basketball can be compared to working with a salary cap in professional sports (though it's not exact).\n\n\"I've been very up front that I'd love for our guys to get taken care of maybe as much as any players in the country,\" May said at a Tuesday afternoon press conference. \"Right now, that's probably not feasible, but I think everyone in our locker room will be making sacrifices, whether it's financial, whether it's minutes. Ultimately, great teams probably have eight or nine guys that deserve to start, that are capable of starting.\"\n\nDuring an interview with Jeff Goodman and Rob Dauster of 'Field of 68,' May said \"some have the Kansas City Royals NIL and some have the Yankees NIL, so it's different for everyone.\" He noted that Michigan is \"probably in the middle -- definitely not the top and definitely not the bottom.\"\n\nIt might even be preferable to be in that position, though. May certainly believes it's possible to win in that sweet spot.\n\n\"I think the championship teams aren't going out and being the highest bidder,\" the Michigan coach said. \"So I think there's always that fine line of that being important but that not being the most important thing.\n\n\"And every situation's different. Listen, if there's a young player that has a very limited value professionally and they have a chance to maximize their value now and it's the most money they could ever make playing basketball, then it might be right for them to capitalize and go after the top dollar.\n\n\"If it's someone that has professional aspirations and maybe the goal of making millions of dollars in the NBA, then they probably should choose the right fit, as far as development, style of play, conference affiliation, whatever the case. It's just like everything else, every case is different.\n\n\"But we've had to weigh that in every recruitment. That's part of the information gathering phase, where if the absolute top dollar is what you're looking for, then we're probably not going to have what you're looking for and we're going to go in another direction. Philosophically, we want the first question to be about development and relationships -- and then after that, hopefully the Name, Image and Likeness piece fits.\"\n\nGoodman asked May what the highest 'price' he's heard of for a player in the transfer portal, saying it was in the seven figures.\n\n\"Over a million dollars for certain guys,\" May said. \"And that's not an isolated event; it's been several conversations where they say this.\"\n\nMay noted that numbers can change quickly and that he doesn't believe all of what's thrown out there.\n\n\"But also, you pick up the phone and you say, 'What's he looking for?' 'Well, he wants minutes and he wants this.' And it comes around to NIL, and the number might be cut in half within 30 seconds,\" May said. \"And so you don't really get mad at people for throwing out numbers...\"\n\nIt might be frustrating to some coaches, but Michigan's man embraces the current landscape of the sport, which could allow his team have early success in Ann Arbor.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "clayton_sayfie@on3.com", "name": "Clayton Sayfie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_May", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dusty May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ann Arbor, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ann Arbor, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/07142456/Michigan-Thumbnail-2024-05-07T152438.777.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547834", "eventUri": "eng-9547834", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-24", "textStart": 789, "textEnd": 797}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The long-term outlook, coming off a school-record loss total, still is a bit fuzzy, after all. But bit by bit, things are starting to come into focus for Dusty May, and he likes what he sees.\n\n\"We expect to win,\" the new Wolverines' coach said with noticeable conviction.\n\nIn his first six weeks on the job, May orchestrated a rapid reboot, initiating a teardown of Juwan Howard's ruined program and then cobbling together a reconstructed roster with six incoming transfers and a pair of recent high school commitments.\n\nTo execute his plan, May drafted off the winds of change in college athletics, where player movement has become the norm and teams are recreated from one year to the next. This new landscape offered May the opportunity to virtually build Michigan from scratch. The natural attrition created by a coaching change in this age of the portal led to the departures of five Wolverines with remaining eligibility, including guard Dug McDaniel, big Tarris Reed Jr. and forward Terrance Williams II. That gave May the greenlight to acquire replacements who fit his free-flowing system that emphasizes motion, tempo, ball-screening, volume perimeter shooting, high-percentage shots near the basket and spacing.\n\nCOACH SPEAK: Michigan basketball's Dusty May 'pleasantly surprised' by state of new roster\n\n\"We love the roster we have now,\" said assistant coach and general manager Kyle Church. \"We feel like it's very, very good.\"\n\nAs May said, \"It's very conducive to how we want to play, and that's to shoot a lot of 3s and that's to get to the rim and get fouled.\"\n\nAt his previous stop, Florida Atlantic, May was able to carry out that vision with impressive results. During his last two seasons in Boca Raton, May went 60-13 and led the Owls to the 2023 Final Four.\n\nTo take a mid-major program to that advanced stage of the NCAA tournament, Michigan assistant Justin Joyner said, \"means you're maximizing your talent.\"\n\nMay did so by embracing the trends in a sport that is increasingly incorporating analytics into strategy and adopting the concept of positionless basketball that calls for anyone on the floor at any time to fill any spot. There is a reason why FAU ranked among the top 30 in adjusted offensive efficiency and effective field goal percentage each of the past two seasons.\n\nMay will try to concoct the same successful formula more than 1,300 miles away in Ann Arbor after curating a roster with that goal in mind.\n\n\"I think we will be able to play very similar,\" May said. \"Obviously it's going to look a little bit different. We're going to be bigger. We probably won't be quite as fast. But we recruited to do the things that we think produce the highest value shots.\"\n\nSHAWN WINDSOR: What Dusty May's secret to rebuilding Michigan basketball in 6 weeks? Love. Yes, really.\n\nSo, May convinced towering FAU center Vlad Goldin to follow him to Michigan and paired him with another 7-footer, Danny Wolf of Yale. They will help anchor the frontcourt while a cast of imports, from programs big and small, provide the outside scoring punch May is seeking. They include former North Texas guard Rubin Jones and 6-foot-10 forward Sam Walters of Alabama, who each shot around 40% from behind the arc. Then there is Roddy Gayle Jr., a transfer guard from Ohio State who has shown a knack for getting to the foul line that May finds particularly attractive. With pass-first Tre Donaldson, an acquisition from Auburn, manning the point, the Wolverines have enough pieces in place to \"give a bunch of different looks,\" according to Church.\n\n\"Any of the guys who play on the perimeter can shoot the 3. They can handle the ball, they can pass, they're versatile,\" he added.\n\nThat was a requirement as May began a recruitment process he equated to \"speed dating.\" Finding the right candidates to implement his plan was part of his grand scheme, which was put in motion quicker than outsiders imagined.\n\nAsked if he was surprised that it materialized this fast, May politely demurred.\n\n\"We're a very confident group,\" May said. \"We believe in our work. We believe in our principles, our way of doing things.\"\n\nThe Wolverines, under May's leadership, have a sense of direction and purpose. Towards the end of Howard's tenure, that was not the case. Michigan was rudderless, and the program didn't have an identity. The roster was poorly managed, with a surplus of players at some positions and shallow depth at other spots. It's how Michigan fell into disrepair, with an 8-24 record this past season and its first last-place finish in the Big Ten since 1967. Following Howard's dismissal, May had to step in and conduct a full renovation. So far, he has tackled that project by carefully assembling a team according to his defined blueprint.\n\nAs assistant Akeem Miskdeen said, \"Everything that coach wants to do, I think we have on our roster.\"\n\nNow, the next step is to make it all work and produce the basketball symphony May desires.\n\nHe won't rest until that goal is achieved.\n\n\"We expect to put a team on the court that is going to compete at a high level every single night,\" May said.\n\nThose were bold words.

Apparently, the answer to that is yes.\n\nAlong those same lines, May revealed that his guard-dominant transfer portal search was no mistake and certainly no accident. As opposed to traditional offenses that feature one main ball handler, May likes for his programs to have multiple point guards on the court at once to help give his teams more playmaking options when pressed. So, those two caveats begin to paint an intriguing picture of what U-M basketball could look like next season. Perhaps Michigan trots out a lineup with a pair of point guards, a wing player like Roddy Gayle Jr. on the outside and two more 7-footers for opponents to fend with on the blocks. Simply put, May has endless options on how to organize his squad next year, and he seems keen to explore each of those paths.\n\nTake former North Texas guard Rubin Jones as another case study in what May values from his collection of hoopers.\n\n\"The reason I wanted to bring him in is so that I didn't have to play against him anymore,\" May said. \"He is a throwback player where he doesn't care about anything other than winning. And he's got a great EQ, his self awareness, his ability to adapt to whatever team he's on and I guess just be a chameleon. If you need defense, it's time to guard. If you need shooting, he's an effective three-point shooter. We've got to help him get better finishing around the rim. That was one area we thought we can help him with. But his unselfishness -- and these are all things I'm talking about offensively because we all love to watch good offense, but defensively he played with a torn hamstring the last half of this past season, a torn hamstring! And we thought he was the best perimeter offender in our league, and our league is a top 10 league, the American Conference. We had good players. We thought he was the most impactful guarding defender in the league, and when you have that ability to shoot and play pick and roll, he's playing the point guard, he's played the three. And so he's another guy we're able to slide up or down and use in a lot of different ways. And we like to have two point guards on the court at all times anyway, just for decision making. It's more difficult for the defense to take away the head of the snake.\"\n\nOut of that entire breakdown, which was a thorough, glowing assessment of Jones' game, May showed that he views basketball through a lens that other coaches may not. Additionally, May mentioned that he's gone through a similar roster-filling mission when he took over the post at FAU, so this is a familiar situation for him to be in.\n\nREAD MORE: LOOK: Two Michigan Basketball Starters Announced?\n\nAnd given May's success in turning the FAU program into a winning outfit, Michigan's basketball program seems to be headed in a markedly positive direction.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_rutter@si.com", "name": "Eric Rutter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_May", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dusty May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Brown_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Brown (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Texas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of North Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pick and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Atlantic_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida Atlantic University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2400,h_1350,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hxatt0n9n584kenase", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547834", "eventUri": "eng-9547834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

During his opening press conference, he stated a desire to win right away in Ann Arbor to the best of their ability.\n\nFast forward six or so weeks later, and Michigan has landed six transfers, added a pair of freshman signees and is in a much healthier spot then they were during the coaching change. Not only is this a team that appears can tread water, but it might be a roster that ranks somewhere in the top half of the Big Ten.\n\nMay feels a little more confident now that he has a roster and coaching staff in place, and says there will not be a day that goes by where winning is not the first priority.\n\n\"Probably more confident saying that now than I was then,\" May said during a meeting with the Michigan media on Tuesday. \"We expect to win. There won't be a night where we walk on the court this season where we say, hey, we need to do this in preparation for later. We'll have expectations when we set foot on the court to win every single night or be in a position to win. A lot goes into winning. Coach Knight used to say a lot, you put yourself into position to win every single night and then you end up winning a lot more than you lose and you put yourself into position to win championships.\"\n\nIt goes beyond the talent that has been acquired, though. May and his coaching staff are a competitive bunch that wants players with a chip on their shoulder and that find ways to win. Michigan will do everything it can to keep bringing those types of guys into the program.\n\n\"The mindset is extremely important,\" May said. \"We're trying to find guys who are incredibly competitive, love the game of basketball and what comes with it. We've typically been attracted to those guys and those guys have been attracted to us. Luckily, now, when you look at our roster, there's always a connection. We felt like we could get real information on players. They can get real information on us. They were direct messaging our former players, checking up on us and making sure.\n\n\"It's a different era where it's very difficult to be dishonest and not be held accountable for it. The mindset was extremely important. As far as the pass-first and stylistic stuff, there has to be talent, skill, also, we feel like if they're really, really competitive then they'll figure some things out. That's what competitors do, they find ways to win. It wasn't that we had to have this or we had to have this guy who didn't shoot this percentage, if he didn't fit the criteria perfectly, we just kind of analyzed why and maybe he could support the team in different areas. There's always a give and take with every player.\"\n\nDespite the confidence in the process and what Michigan has built this far, May does not want to put a specific goal or label on anything they set out to accomplish. It comes with a day-to-day mindset of squeezing every drop out of the task ahead.\n\n\"Actually, I shy away from goals every single day,\" May said. \"I have no idea what our goals are other than be really, really good this next possession, this next practice and this next workout and this next conditioning segment. Really, other than that, the long-term goals, I never think about it.\n\n\"We expect to put a team on the court that is going to compete at a high level every single night. With the talent level we have, there's no reason why we couldn't expect to win a lot of those.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_broome@on3.com", "name": "Anthony Broome", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_May", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dusty May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ann Arbor, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ann Arbor, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/03/29115901/USATSI_22871791-e1711731565450.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547834", "eventUri": "eng-9547834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Breaks Down Danny Wolf's Game\n\nMichigan Wolverines basketball will play with twin seven-footers down low for around 14 minutes per game, head coach Dusty May said when asked about using Yale transfer Danny Wolf (7-0) and FAU transfer Vladislav Goldin (7-1). Assistant coach Drew Williamson, who spent the previous three seasons with May and the Owls in Boca Raton, worked with the big men and is excited about the front line U-M has in place for 2024-25.\n\nWilliamson knows exactly how to coach Goldin, who averaged 15.7 points, 6.9 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game for FAU last season. The Michigan assistant raved about what the big man brings to the table.\n\n\"He's an unbelievable worker, man,\" Williamson said. \"The No. 1 thing I always thought about was, he was the first one to get in line. 'I'm going first in every drill. I'm going first.' Those things stand out.\n\n\"But when you talk about him as a teammate, he's unbelievable. He's like, 'I want to win. So whatever that means for me as an individual, I'll take a step back, I'll take a step forward, but I want to win games.' And he cares about everybody he comes into contact with.\n\n\"You guys will see, he really genuinely cares about who his new teammates will be, who he's rooming with, all of those different things. He really has a unique gift to want to care and want to love and want to be a part of something bigger than himself.\"\n\nGoldin had 72 starts under his belt in the prior two seasons before the 2023-24 campaign, averaging 10.2 points and 6.5 boards per contest as a junior. But last season was different, with the new Michigan big taking a big step forward.\n\n\"On the court, when he's locked in, he's dominant, man,\" Williamson continued. \"He finally kind of took a stride last year where he realized how dominant he was and just kind of did it the whole game.\n\n\"He would have spurts before, but last year he took strides to where it was like, 'Give me the ball, give me the ball. I'm gonna go dunk, I'm gonna block a shot,' things where he changed the impact of a game.\"\n\nGoldin will protect the rim for Michigan defensively. He ranked 73rd nationally with a 6.9-percent block rate last season. Williamson said that will open up other possibilities for his teammates on that end of the floor. The Nalchick, Russia, native recorded 1.9 blocks per contest over his last 17 outings, showing a jump in production after a shift in mindset.\n\n\"It allows the guards and wings to be a lot more aggressive, because now I know I have this big seven-foot guy behind me to protect the rim,\" the Michigan assistant explained.\n\n\"I think one of the biggest strides we made last year as a team was when Coach [May] just made it a little bit simpler for Vlad to say, 'Hey, listen, we just need you to protect the rim. So stop worrying about the pick-and-pop fives that are shooting two threes a game. If a guy gets down hill, we want you to block it.' And you could see later in the year where he just started going and attacking the rim. If he had that mindset earlier in the year, he could've been a candidate for defensive player of the year.\n\n\"So I think he's figuring out ways to be able to be effective. And then just the amount of shots that he affects. Even if he's not blocking the shot, you'll still have to think about a seven-footer being there. Now I have to change my shot.\"\n\nAt 250 pounds, Wolf is extremely mobile for a seven-footer. He shot 34.9 percent on 83 three-point attempts and finished with a 50.7-percent mark from inside the arc. However, his perimeter defense -- particularly against smaller, quicker players -- will be something Williamson and Co. will drill with him when he arrives on campus in June.\n\n\"Even with that part, he can right now,\" Williamson said of Wolf's ability to guard on the perimeter. \"It would be a developmental part, too. When we talk about player development and most people automatically talk about offensive development. But player development is also being able to help you understand angles and understand if you got a smaller guard on you, just take a step back. Your arms are long enough to affect the shot. So those are going to be things that we'll be able to help Danny with and whoever else we need to.\"\n\nWilliamson focused on the same area with Goldin.\n\n\"We worked with Vlad a lot over the last two years with him moving laterally, because we switched one through four at FAU, so teams' solution was to figure out a way to get Vlad on a guard,\" the Michigan assistant explained. \"So we spent time after practice, a lot, just with our smaller, quicker guards one-on-one [with Goldin] for five minutes. So on player development, those things come into account, too.\"\n\nMichigan retained redshirt junior forward Will Tschetter, a 6-foot-8, 245-pounder who averaged 6.8 points and 2.4 rebounds in 17.9 minutes per game last season, shooting 51.9 percent on 54 three-point attempts. He fits the kind of player May and Co. want out of a forward, and he's also been a positive for the culture.\n\n\"I love Will, man,\" Williamson said. \"On most of the visits we've had, he's kind of been the tour guide, to go out to eat with us, to give us ideas where we should eat at the restaurants. First of all, I think his energy is so contagious.

Illinois' Terrence Shannon Jr. and North Carolina's Caleb Love are two they identify as potential program-changers for the Wolverines who ended up at other schools because they \"weren't allowed in.\"\n\nBut there are two sides to that coin, and new Michigan head coach Dusty May elaborated Tuesday on what it takes. He landed a handful from the portal and said there was one thing they had to do with all of them.\n\n\"We have to do our work early,\" May said. \"There's no reason to invest our time, energy, and effort -- especially the emotional energy -- that goes into recruiting (on guys who can't get in). There's one thing to make a call, and there's another to really be invested in that call and be present and be relational in it.\n\n\"We just try to see who fits us in the beginning, and usually the ones that fit us like us better than the ones who don't. We just tried to streamline it by doing our homework early, getting the right information and attacking those guys.\"\n\nThere were a few guys they had to stay away from that were \"maybes\" when it came to getting into school, he admitted. Given the time frame, however, they concentrated more on the \"sure things.\"\n\n\"Out of all the guys we signed, it was relatively simple after we got their initial transcripts,\" May said. \"We moved forward and went from there.\"\n\nIn short, they were well organized and had a plan. Some have lamented there aren't enough guys who can flat out play, \"fit\" what the Michigan coaches are looking for, and aren't looking for the biggest bag. May and his staff shot down all those narratives in their first class, one May expects to compete very well in the Big Ten.\n\nBut he also wants his guys taken care of to the best of the collectives' ability, and he made it clear he'd fight for his guys. When he first arrived, he told us he'd spend about a third of his time helping fund raise, working with the collectives, etc. to help raise money and create opportunities for the players.\n\n\"It's going well,\" he said, acknowledging what we'd heard -- that he'd met with Michigan donors personally during dead periods and stayed in touch with the fundraisers. \"It's going well. I've enjoyed getting to know those guys who run the [Champions Circle] collective. We have an ongoing relationship; we talk with them almost every single day.\n\n\"Our job is to help. It's another extension of our team. Those guys, our success is tied to their success, and I think their success is probably tied our success, as well. Just like everything else, we all want what's best for Michigan, so we do whatever we can to help each other be successful.\"\n\nThere's no question they've made progress on the Michigan football end. It's encouraging that May is encouraged by what he's seen in his first few months, as well.\n\n\"Those guys have worked incredibly hard to help us get where we need to be in the NIL space,\" May said. \"We're pleased to this point, especially with how much time and effort they put into it.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_balas@on3.com", "name": "Chris Balas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_May", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dusty May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrence_Shannon_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrence Shannon Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Love", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_athlete_compensation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Student athlete compensation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/07142456/Michigan-Thumbnail-2024-05-07T152438.777.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547834", "eventUri": "eng-9547834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

There was little depth and the leadership was close to absent, if not absent entirely. Thus, it was no surprise that the Wolverines went 8-24 -- the worst record in program history.\n\nWhen Dusty May took over, he inherited a program not only in disarray, but one with three scholarship players. Stars like Tarris Reed Jr. and Dug McDaniel were in the transfer portal and ended up elsewhere and stalwarts like Terrance Williams did the same. So May had Nimari Burnett, Jace Howard, and Will Tschetter to work with -- if he could keep them.\n\nAnd keep them he did. But then what he did was even more impressive. Through recruiting and the transfer portal, May assembled a complete team with a ton of star power. It's one that has depth and looks like it could contend in his first year at the helm.\n\nAt his introductory press conference, May said that Michigan would not be in rebuilding mode and that they would win in year one, and meeting with the media on Tuesday, he affirmed that he likes the direction his first team in Ann Arbor is moving in.\n\n\"Probably more confident saying that now than I was then,\" May said. \"We expect to win. There won't be a night where we walk on the court this season where we say, 'Hey, we need to do this in preparation for later.' We'll have expectations when we set foot on the court to win every single night or be in a position to win.\n\n\"A lot goes into winning. Coach Knight used to say a lot, you put yourself into position to win every single night and then you end up winning a lot more than you lose and you put yourself into position to win championships.\"\n\nSo how did May go about bringing together his version of the Avengers? How did he assemble his team?\n\nIt started with bringing in the right staff, people who complement him and are strong where he's weak. Then, they went out and found players that fit his vision.\n\nThe surprising thing to him was that he basically was able to highlight targets and secure them, with very little pushback. In essence, he got the players he wanted and that should help propel the team forward.\n\n\"We're a very confident group, we believe in our work. We believe in our principles, our way of doing things,\" May said. \"We've been pleasantly surprised with how well-received this university and this basketball program has been. We've also been pleasantly surprised with the guys who joined us.\n\n\"Did I anticipate it was going to go like this? I probably thought we would miss on a few guys than we had but it's speed dating like I said in the initial press conference and decisions are made quickly. I do think we provided a really unique situation for a lot of these guys.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_May", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dusty May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_transfer_portal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NCAA transfer portal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ann Arbor, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ann Arbor, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimari_Burnett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nimari Burnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cUYcNi2Ea1Lo2j99TAoqJA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03MjA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/wolverines_wire_usa_today_articles_790/62d7ae0e400377a3e2936016f148a614", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547834", "eventUri": "eng-9547834", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ann Arbor, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Coaches across the country spend their minimal free time golfing, attending horse races, fishing or enjoying other activities. Surely May has dabbled in interests outside of basketball, but coaching the sport is what he loves to do.\n\nPerhaps 'learning' -- about leadership, coaching, etc. -- qualifies as May's hobby.\n\nNew Michigan assistant coach and director of player development Drew Williamson has seen it up close and personal, having worked for May at Florida Atlantic the previous three seasons.\n\n\"The biggest thing for me is how he's always trying to learn something new. It's the most incredible thing,\" Williamson said. \"You watch, and he's very, very poised and under control all the time, so I always look at him as he has stuff figured out. But when I came in the office every morning at FAU, he would be there at 7, and he's ready a book or listening to a podcast, something new.\n\n\"I'm like, 'Man, how much are you going to learn?' But he's a continuous learner. He has really pushed myself and I'm sure the other guys on the staff that we have to continue to get better. It's always a journey to take one step to get better and better every day.\"\n\nMichigan assistant coach Mike Boynton, Oklahoma State's head coach from 2017-24, said on the 'Defend The Block' podcast that he's \"met very few people who I've felt like I've gotta step up my energy game for,\" but that May is one of them.\n\n\"Dusty is a guy who I've had to go to bed at night just making sure I've done everything that I was supposed to, because he really brings that every single day -- and he's so positive about it,\" Boynton explained.\n\nWilliamson has been around it better and said the insatiable mentality rubs off on the rest of the program.\n\n\"He challenges you to get better,\" Williamson said of the Michigan head coach. \"What I think happens is that comes from the top down, so then the players see the amount of work and the amount of effort and how he feels about each day, improving. You have to follow it. The players see it, and then once you get one or two players to buy into it, you start seeing it trickle down to every single player. If you don't get better, you're going to stick out.\"\n\n\"We did a really, really good job of bringing in guys that already want to get better. But once they see Coach's work ethic, it's like, man ... some days I'm like, 'Man, I gotta figure out something to do!' I gotta go over here and read some book or something, listen to some podcast. He does a good job, too, he sends us podcasts, he sends us books.\"\n\nFor Christmas last year, May gifted his staff members books. Look at Williamson's text message exchanges with May and one will find podcast links the head coach sends.\n\n\"Maybe four years ago, I would be like, 'Ah, I don't know,' but now being around him every single day, it's almost like you understand the purpose of it,\" Williamson said of being gifted a book last Christmas. \"Being able to see that I don't have to know this entire book, but if I can get two or three things out of this book to help [FAU transfer and new Michigan center] Vlad[islav] Goldin next year, it's worth reading the book.\n\n\"That's his process -- if I can get one thing out of this podcast so that I can help [Michigan assistant] Coach [Justin] Joyner out tomorrow, then the podcast was worth it. That's the part I've been able to see in his growth and understand for myself, just read the book, listen to the podcast and you'll learn something.\"\n\nThat sounds not-so-oddly familiar to May's line of thinking, which Williamson has adopted over the years\n\nIt's clear Michigan's coach, who led Florida Atlantic to the 2023 Final Four, isn't just \"obsessed\" with basketball, as he's said, but also with learning and growing.\n\n\"He just never stops wanting to get better,\" Williamson said. \"It's unique to me because he's really, really good at what he does already, but it's like he's got something that's continuing to push him that says, 'Hey, that's last year, that's yesterday. I was really, really good yesterday, but I've gotta be even better today.'\n\n\"And he has that mindset to where every single day it's a challenge for himself to get better, but also a challenge to figure out ways to help each player get better and that locker room get better that day.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "clayton_sayfie@on3.com", "name": "Clayton Sayfie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_May", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dusty May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Atlantic_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida Atlantic University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Boynton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Boynton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/08131239/Michigan-Thumbnail-2024-05-08T141220.727.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547834", "eventUri": "eng-9547834", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}
